Abstract: Human animation aims to generate temporally coherent and visually consistent videos over long sequences, yet modeling long-range dependencies while preserving frame quality remains challenging. Inspired by the human ability to leverage past observations for interpreting ongoing actions, we propose FrameCache, a training-free three-stage framework consisting of Screen, Cache, and Match. In the Screen stage, a multi-dimensional, quality-aware mechanism with adaptive thresholds dynamically selects informative frames; the Cache stage maintains a reference pool using a dynamic replacement-hit strategy, preserving both diversity and relevance; and the Match stage extracts behavioral features to perform motion-consistent reference matching for coherent animation guidance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that FrameCache consistently improves temporal coherence and visual stability while integrating seamlessly with diverse baselines. Despite these encouraging results, further analysis reveals that its effectiveness depends on baseline temporal reasoning and real-synthetic consistency, motivating future work on compatibility conditions and adaptive cache mechanisms. Code will be made publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22160v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Attention Isn't All You Need for Emotion Recognition:Domain Features Outperform Transformers on the EAV Dataset</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22161</link><description>arXiv:2601.22161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of multimodal emotion recognition using the EAV dataset, investigating whether complex attention mechanisms improve performance on small datasets. We implement three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3). Our experiments show that sophisticated attention mechanisms consistently underperform on small datasets. M2 models achieved 5 to 13 percentage points below baselines due to overfitting and destruction of pretrained features. In contrast, simple domain-appropriate modifications proved effective: adding delta MFCCs to the audio CNN improved accuracy from 61.9\% to \textbf{65.56\%} (+3.66pp), while frequency-domain features for EEG achieved \textbf{67.62\%} (+7.62pp over the paper baseline). Our vision transformer baseline (M1) reached \textbf{75.30\%}, exceeding the paper's ViViT result (74.5\%) through domain-specific pretraining, and vision delta features achieved \textbf{72.68\%} (+1.28pp over the paper CNN). These findings demonstrate that for small-scale emotion recognition, domain knowledge and proper implementation outperform architectural complexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22161v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Open-Vocabulary Detectors Transfer to Aerial Imagery? A Comparative Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22164</link><description>arXiv:2601.22164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) enables zero-shot recognition of novel categories through vision-language models, achieving strong performance on natural images. However, transferability to aerial imagery remains unexplored. We present the first systematic benchmark evaluating five state-of-the-art OVD models on the LAE-80C aerial dataset (3,592 images, 80 categories) under strict zero-shot conditions. Our experimental protocol isolates semantic confusion from visual localization through Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes. Results reveal severe domain transfer failure: the best model (OWLv2) achieves only 27.6% F1-score with 69% false positive rate. Critically, reducing vocabulary size from 80 to 3.2 classes yields 15x improvement, demonstrating that semantic confusion is the primary bottleneck. Prompt engineering strategies such as domain-specific prefixing and synonym expansion, fail to provide meaningful performance gains. Performance varies dramatically across datasets (F1: 0.53 on DIOR, 0.12 on FAIR1M), exposing brittleness to imaging conditions. These findings establish baseline expectations and highlight the need for domain-adaptive approaches in aerial OVD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22164v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] In Vino Veritas and Vulnerabilities: Examining LLM Safety via Drunk Language Inducement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22169</link><description>arXiv:2601.22169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans are susceptible to undesirable behaviours and privacy leaks under the influence of alcohol. This paper investigates drunk language, i.e., text written under the influence of alcohol, as a driver for safety failures in large language models (LLMs). We investigate three mechanisms for inducing drunk language in LLMs: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training. When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language. The simplicity and efficiency of our drunk language inducement approaches position them as potential counters for LLM safety tuning, highlighting significant risks to LLM safety.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22169v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Models: A Mathematical Formulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22170</link><description>arXiv:2601.22170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) process and predict sequences containing text to answer questions, and address tasks including document summarization, providing recommendations, writing software and solving quantitative problems. We provide a mathematical framework for LLMs by describing the encoding of text sequences into sequences of tokens, defining the architecture for next-token prediction models, explaining how these models are learned from data, and demonstrating how they are deployed to address a variety of tasks. The mathematical sophistication required to understand this material is not high, and relies on straightforward ideas from information theory, probability and optimization. Nonetheless, the combination of ideas resting on these different components from the mathematical sciences yields a complex algorithmic structure; and this algorithmic structure has demonstrated remarkable empirical successes. The mathematical framework established here provides a platform from which it is possible to formulate and address questions concerning the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the algorithms that constitute LLMs. The framework also suggests directions for development of modified and new methodologies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22170v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the $L^p$-Convergence and Denoising Performance of Durrmeyer-Type Max-Min Neural Network Operators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22174</link><description>arXiv:2601.22174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Durrmeyer-type generalizations of maximum-minimum neural network operators. The primary objective of this study is to establish the convergence of these operators in the $L^{p}$ norm for functions $f\in L^{p}([a,b],[0,1])$ with $1\leq p&lt;\infty$. To this end, we analyze the properties of sigmoidal functions and maximum-minimum operations, subsequently establishing the convergence of the proposed operator in pointwise, supremum, and $L^{p}$ norms. Furthermore, we derive quantitative estimates for the rates of convergence. In the applications section, numerical and graphical examples demonstrate that the proposed Durrmeyer-type operators provide smoother approximations compared to Kantorovich-type and standard max-min operators. Finally, we highlight the superior filtering performance of these operators in signal analysis, validating their effectiveness in both approximation and data processing tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22174v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Discovering High-utility Sequential Rules with Increasing Utility Ratio</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22178</link><description>arXiv:2601.22178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utility-driven mining is an essential task in data science, as it can provide deeper insight into the real world. High-utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) aims at discovering sequential rules with high utility and high confidence. It can certainly provide reliable information for decision-making because it uses confidence as an evaluation metric, as well as some algorithms like HUSRM and US-Rule. However, in current rule-growth mining methods, the linkage between HUSRs and their generation remains ambiguous. Specifically, it is unclear whether the addition of new items affects the utility or confidence of the former rule, leading to an increase or decrease in their values. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate the problem of mining HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm called SRIU for discovering all HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio using two distinct expansion methods, including left-right expansion and right-left expansion. SRIU also utilizes the item pair estimated utility pruning strategy (IPEUP) to reduce the search space. Moreover, for the two expansion methods, two sets of upper bounds and corresponding pruning strategies are introduced. To enhance the efficiency of SRIU, several optimizations are incorporated. These include utilizing the Bitmap to reduce memory consumption and designing a compact utility table for the mining procedure. Finally, extensive experimental results from both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, to better assess the quality of the generated sequential rules, metrics such as confidence and conviction are employed, which further demonstrate that SRIU can improve the relevance of mining results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22178v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-utility Sequential Rule Mining Utilizing Segmentation Guided by Confidence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22179</link><description>arXiv:2601.22179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the domain of data mining, one critical objective is the discovery of sequential rules with high utility. The goal is to discover sequential rules that exhibit both high utility and strong confidence, which are valuable in real-world applications. However, existing high-utility sequential rule mining algorithms suffer from redundant utility computations, as different rules may consist of the same sequence of items. When these items can form multiple distinct rules, additional utility calculations are required. To address this issue, this study proposes a sequential rule mining algorithm that utilizes segmentation guided by confidence (RSC), which employs confidence-guided segmentation to reduce redundant utility computation. It adopts a method that precomputes the confidence of segmented rules by leveraging the support of candidate subsequences in advance. Once the segmentation point is determined, all rules with different antecedents and consequents are generated simultaneously. RSC uses a utility-linked table to accelerate candidate sequence generation and introduces a stricter utility upper bound, called the reduced remaining utility of a sequence, to address sequences with duplicate items. Finally, the proposed RSC method was evaluated on multiple datasets, and the results demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22179v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MrRoPE: Mixed-radix Rotary Position Embedding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22181</link><description>arXiv:2601.22181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)-extension refers to modifying or generalizing the Rotary Position Embedding scheme to handle longer sequences than those encountered during pre-training. However, current extension strategies are highly diverse and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper, we propose MrRoPE (Mixed-radix RoPE), a generalized encoding formulation based on a radix system conversion perspective, which elegantly unifies various RoPE-extension approaches as distinct radix conversion strategies. Based on this theory, we introduce two training-free extensions, MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro, which leverage uniform and progressive radix conversion strategies, respectively, to achieve 'train short, test long' generalization. Without fine-tuning, MrRoPE-Pro sustains over 85% recall in the 128K-context Needle-in-a-Haystack test and achieves more than double YaRN's accuracy on Infinite-Bench retrieval and dialogue subsets. Theoretical analysis confirms that MrRoPE-Pro effectively raises the upper bound of RoPE's attainable encoding length, which further validates the reliability and utility of our theory and methodology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ShellForge: Adversarial Co-Evolution of Webshell Generation and Multi-View Detection for Robust Webshell Defense</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22182</link><description>arXiv:2601.22182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Webshells remain a primary foothold for attackers to compromise servers, particularly within PHP ecosystems. However, existing detection mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with rapid variant evolution and sophisticated obfuscation techniques that camouflage malicious intent. Furthermore, many current defenses suffer from high false-alarm rates when encountering benign administrative scripts that employ heavy obfuscation for intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we present ShellForge, an adversarial co-evolution framework that couples automated webshell generation with multi-view detection to continuously harden defensive boundaries. The framework operates through an iterative co-training loop where a generator and a detector mutually reinforce each other via the exchange of hard samples. The generator is optimized through supervised fine-tuning and preference-based reinforcement learning to synthesize functional, highly evasive variants. Simultaneously, we develop a multi-view fusion detector that integrates semantic features from long-string compression, structural features from pruned abstract syntax trees, and global statistical indicators such as Shannon entropy. To minimize false positives, ShellForge utilizes a LLM-based transformation to create de-malicious samples--scripts that retain complex obfuscation patterns but lack harmful payloads--serving as high-quality hard negatives during training. Evaluations on the public FWOID benchmark demonstrate that ShellForge significantly enhances defensive robustness. Upon convergence, the detector maintains a 0.981 F1-score while the generator achieves a 0.939 evasion rate against commercial engines on VirusTotal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22182v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tacit Coordination of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22184</link><description>arXiv:2601.22184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tacit coordination games with multiple outcomes, purely rational solution concepts, such as Nash equilibria, provide no guidance for which equilibrium to choose. Shelling's theory explains how, in these settings, humans coordinate by relying on focal points: solutions or outcomes that naturally arise because they stand out in some way as salient or prominent to all players. This work studies Large Language Models (LLMs) as players in tacit coordination games, and addresses how, when, and why focal points emerge. We compare and quantify the coordination capabilities of LLMs in cooperative and competitive games for which human experiments are available. We also introduce several learning-free strategies to improve the coordination of LLMs, with themselves and with humans. On a selection of heterogeneous open-source models, including Llama, Qwen, and GPT-oss, we discover that LLMs have a remarkable capability to coordinate and often outperform humans, yet fail on common-sense coordination that involves numbers or nuanced cultural archetypes. This paper constitutes the first large-scale assessment of LLMs' tacit coordination within the theoretical and psychological framework of focal points.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22184v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MemeChain: A Multimodal Cross-Chain Dataset for Meme Coin Forensics and Risk Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22185</link><description>arXiv:2601.22185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meme coin ecosystem has grown into one of the most active yet least observable segments of the cryptocurrency market, characterized by extreme churn, minimal project commitment, and widespread fraudulent behavior. While countless meme coins are deployed across multiple blockchains, they rely heavily on off-chain web and social infrastructure to signal legitimacy. These very signals are largely absent from existing datasets, which are often limited to single-chain data or lack the multimodal artifacts required for comprehensive risk modeling.
  To address this gap, we introduce MemeChain, a large-scale, open-source, cross-chain dataset comprising 34,988 meme coins across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. MemeChain integrates on-chain data with off-chain artifacts, including website HTML source code, token logos, and linked social media accounts, enabling multimodal and forensic study of meme coin projects. Analysis of the dataset shows that visual branding is frequently omitted in low-effort deployments, and many projects lack a functional website. Moreover, we quantify the ecosystem's extreme volatility, identifying 1,801 tokens (5.15%) that cease all trading activity within just 24 hours of launch. By providing unified cross-chain coverage and rich off-chain context, MemeChain serves as a foundational resource for research in financial forensics, multimodal anomaly detection, and automated scam prevention in the meme coin ecosystem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Partial Rewriting and Value Interpretation of Logically Constrained Terms (Full Version)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22191</link><description>arXiv:2601.22191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logically constrained term rewrite systems (LCTRSs) are a rewriting formalism that naturally supports built-in data structures, including integers and bit-vectors. The recent framework of existentially constrained terms and most general constrained rewriting on them (Takahata et al., 2025) has many advantages over the original approach of rewriting constrained terms. In this paper, we introduce partial constrained rewriting, a variant of rewriting existentially constrained terms whose underlying idea has already appeared implicitly in previous analyses and applications of LCTRSs. We examine the differences between these two notions of constrained rewriting. First, we establish a direct correspondence between them, leveraging subsumption and equivalence of constrained terms where appropriate. Then we give characterizations of each of them, using the interpretation of existentially constrained terms by instantiation. We further introduce the novel notion of value interpretation, that highlights subtle differences between partial and most general rewriting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22191v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multitask Learning for Earth Observation Data Classification with Hybrid Quantum Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22195</link><description>arXiv:2601.22195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing attention as a potential solution to address the challenges of computation requirements in the future. Earth observation (EO) has entered the era of Big Data, and the computational demands for effectively analyzing large EO data with complex deep learning models have become a bottleneck. Motivated by this, we aim to leverage quantum computing for EO data classification and explore its advantages despite the current limitations of quantum devices. This paper presents a hybrid model that incorporates multitask learning to assist efficient data encoding and employs a location weight module with quantum convolution operations to extract valid features for classification. The validity of our proposed model was evaluated using multiple EO benchmarks. Additionally, we experimentally explored the generalizability of our model and investigated the factors contributing to its advantage, highlighting the potential of QML in EO data analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22195v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Linux Kernel Recency Matters, CVE Severity Doesn't, and History Fades</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22196</link><description>arXiv:2601.22196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2024, the Linux kernel became its own Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Numbering Authority (CNA), formalizing how kernel vulnerabilities are identified and tracked. We analyze the anatomy and dynamics of kernel CVEs using metadata, associated commits, and patch latency to understand what drives patching. Results show that severity and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) metrics have a negligible association with patch latency, whereas kernel recency is a reasonable predictor in survival models. Kernel developers fix newer kernels sooner, while older ones retain unresolved CVEs. Commits introducing vulnerabilities are typically broader and more complex than their fixes, though often only approximate reconstructions of development history. The Linux kernel remains a unique open-source project -- its CVE process is no exception.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Signals Generate Clinical Notes in the Wild</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22197</link><description>arXiv:2601.22197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating clinical reports that summarize abnormal patterns, diagnostic findings, and clinical interpretations from long-term EEG recordings remains labor-intensive. We curate a large-scale clinical EEG dataset with $9{,}922$ reports paired with approximately $11{,}000$ hours of EEG recordings from $9{,}048$ patients. We therefore develop CELM, the first clinical EEG-to-Language foundation model capable of summarizing long-duration, variable-length EEG recordings and performing end-to-end clinical report generation at multiple scales, including recording description, background activity, epileptiform abnormalities, events/seizures, and impressions. Experimental results show that, with patient history supervision, our method achieves $70\%$--$95\%$ average relative improvements in standard generation metrics (e.g., ROUGE-1 and METEOR) from $0.2$--$0.3$ to $0.4$--$0.6$. In the zero-shot setting without patient history, CELM attains generation scores in the range of $0.43$--$0.52$, compared to baselines of $0.17$--$0.26$. CELM integrates pretrained EEG foundation models with language models to enable scalable multimodal learning.

Abstract: An optimal solution to the localization problem is essential for developing autonomous robotic systems. Apart from autonomous vehicles, precision agriculture is one of the elds that can bene t most from these systems. Although LiDAR place recognition is a widely used technique in recent years to achieve accurate localization, it is mostly used in urban settings. However, the lack of distinctive features and the unstructured nature of agricultural environments make place recognition challenging. This work presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art the latest deep learning applications for agricultural environments and LPR techniques. We focus on the challenges that arise in these environments. We analyze the existing approaches, datasets, and metrics used to evaluate LPR system performance and discuss the limitations and future directions of research in this eld. This is the rst survey that focuses on LiDAR based localization in agricultural settings, with the aim of providing a thorough understanding and fostering further research in this specialized domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22198v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Game-Based and Gamified Robotics Education: A Comparative Systematic Review and Design Guidelines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22199</link><description>arXiv:2601.22199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotics education fosters computational thinking, creativity, and problem-solving, but remains challenging due to technical complexity. Game-based learning (GBL) and gamification offer engagement benefits, yet their comparative impact remains unclear. We present the first PRISMA-aligned systematic review and comparative synthesis of GBL and gamification in robotics education, analyzing 95 studies from 12,485 records across four databases (2014-2025). We coded each study's approach, learning context, skill level, modality, pedagogy, and outcomes (k = .918). Three patterns emerged: (1) approach-context-pedagogy coupling (GBL more prevalent in informal settings, while gamification dominated formal classrooms [p &lt; .001] and favored project-based learning [p = .009]); (2) emphasis on introductory programming and modular kits, with limited adoption of advanced software (~17%), advanced hardware (~5%), or immersive technologies (~22%); and (3) short study horizons, relying on self-report. We propose eight research directions and a design space outlining best practices and pitfalls, offering actionable guidance for robotics education.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22199v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FedAdaVR: Adaptive Variance Reduction for Robust Federated Learning under Limited Client Participation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22204</link><description>arXiv:2601.22204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) encounters substantial challenges due to heterogeneity, leading to gradient noise, client drift, and partial client participation errors, the last of which is the most pervasive but remains insufficiently addressed in current literature. In this paper, we propose FedAdaVR, a novel FL algorithm aimed at solving heterogeneity issues caused by sporadic client participation by incorporating an adaptive optimiser with a variance reduction technique. This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets, under both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, demonstrate that FedAdaVR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22204v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Imitation Learning Under Measurement Error and Distribution Shift</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22206</link><description>arXiv:2601.22206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study offline imitation learning (IL) when part of the decision-relevant state is observed only through noisy measurements and the distribution may change between training and deployment. Such settings induce spurious state-action correlations, so standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- whether conditioning on raw measurements or ignoring them -- can converge to systematically biased policies under distribution shift. We propose a general framework for IL under measurement error, inspired by explicitly modeling the causal relationships among the variables, yielding a target that retains a causal interpretation and is robust to distribution shift. Building on ideas from proximal causal inference, we introduce \texttt{CausIL}, which treats noisy state observations as proxy variables, and we provide identification conditions under which the target policy is recoverable from demonstrations without rewards or interactive expert queries. We develop estimators for both discrete and continuous state spaces; for continuous settings, we use an adversarial procedure over RKHS function classes to learn the required parameters. We evaluate \texttt{CausIL} on semi-simulated longitudinal data from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 cohort and demonstrate improved robustness to distribution shift compared to BC baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22206v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stalled, Biased, and Confused: Uncovering Reasoning Failures in LLMs for Cloud-Based Root Cause Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22208</link><description>arXiv:2601.22208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) is essential for diagnosing failures within complex software systems to ensure system reliability. The highly distributed and interdependent nature of modern cloud-based systems often complicates RCA efforts, particularly for multi-hop fault propagation, where symptoms appear far from their true causes. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to enhance automated RCA. However, their practical value for RCA depends on the fidelity of reasoning and decision-making. Existing work relies on historical incident corpora, operates directly on high-volume telemetry beyond current LLM capacity, or embeds reasoning inside complex multi-agent pipelines -- conditions that obscure whether failures arise from reasoning itself or from peripheral design choices.
  We present a focused empirical evaluation that isolates an LLM's reasoning behavior. We design a controlled experimental framework that foregrounds the LLM by using a simplified experimental setting. We evaluate six LLMs under two agentic workflows (ReAct and Plan-and-Execute) and a non-agentic baseline on two real-world case studies (GAIA and OpenRCA). In total, we executed 48,000 simulated failure scenarios, totaling 228 days of execution time. We measure both root-cause accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning traces. We produce a labeled taxonomy of 16 common RCA reasoning failures and use an LLM-as-a-Judge for annotation. Our results clarify where current open-source LLMs succeed and fail in multi-hop RCA, quantify sensitivity to input data modalities, and identify reasoning failures that predict final correctness. Together, these contributions provide transparent and reproducible empirical results and a failure taxonomy to guide future work on reasoning-driven system diagnosis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22208v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Recommend Multi-Agent Subgraphs from Calling Trees</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22209</link><description>arXiv:2601.22209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) increasingly solve complex tasks by orchestrating agents and tools selected from rapidly growing marketplaces. As these marketplaces expand, many candidates become functionally overlapping, making selection not just a retrieval problem: beyond filtering relevant agents, an orchestrator must choose options that are reliable, compatible with the current execution context, and able to cooperate with other selected agents. Existing recommender systems -- largely built for item-level ranking from flat user-item logs -- do not directly address the structured, sequential, and interaction-dependent nature of agent orchestration. We address this gap by \textbf{formulating agent recommendation in MAS as a constrained decision problem} and introducing a generic \textbf{constrained recommendation framework} that first uses retrieval to build a compact candidate set conditioned on the current subtask and context, and then performs \textbf{utility optimization} within this feasible set using a learned scorer that accounts for relevance, reliability, and interaction effects. We ground both the formulation and learning signals in \textbf{historical calling trees}, which capture the execution structure of MAS (parent-child calls, branching dependencies, and local cooperation patterns) beyond what flat logs provide. The framework supports two complementary settings: \textbf{agent-level recommendation} (select the next agent/tool) and \textbf{system-level recommendation} (select a small, connected agent team/subgraph for coordinated execution). To enable systematic evaluation, we construct a unified calling-tree benchmark by normalizing invocation logs from eight heterogeneous multi-agent corpora into a shared structured representation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22209v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Latent Spherical Flow Policy for Reinforcement Learning with Combinatorial Actions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22211</link><description>arXiv:2601.22211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with combinatorial action spaces remains challenging because feasible action sets are exponentially large and governed by complex feasibility constraints, making direct policy parameterization impractical. Existing approaches embed task-specific value functions into constrained optimization programs or learn deterministic structured policies, sacrificing generality and policy expressiveness. We propose a solver-induced \emph{latent spherical flow policy} that brings the expressiveness of modern generative policies to combinatorial RL while guaranteeing feasibility by design. Our method, LSFlow, learns a \emph{stochastic} policy in a compact continuous latent space via spherical flow matching, and delegates feasibility to a combinatorial optimization solver that maps each latent sample to a valid structured action. To improve efficiency, we train the value network directly in the latent space, avoiding repeated solver calls during policy optimization. To address the piecewise-constant and discontinuous value landscape induced by solver-based action selection, we introduce a smoothed Bellman operator that yields stable, well-defined learning targets. Empirically, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 20.6\% across a range of challenging combinatorial RL tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22211v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Lies Beneath: A Call for Distribution-based Visual Question &amp; Answer Datasets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22218</link><description>arXiv:2601.22218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has become an important benchmark for assessing how large multimodal models (LMMs) interpret images. However, most VQA datasets focus on real-world images or simple diagrammatic analysis, with few focused on interpreting complex scientific charts. Indeed, many VQA datasets that analyze charts do not contain the underlying data behind those charts or assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. In reality, charts are transformations (i.e. analysis, simplification, modification) of data. This distinction introduces a reasoning challenge in VQA that the current datasets do not capture. In this paper, we argue for a dedicated VQA benchmark for scientific charts where there is no 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. To do so, we survey existing VQA datasets and highlight limitations of the current field. We then generate synthetic histogram charts based on ground truth data, and ask both humans and a large reasoning model questions where precise answers depend on access to the underlying data. We release the open-source dataset, including figures, underlying data, distribution parameters used to generate the data, and bounding boxes for all figure marks and text for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22218v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lost in Space? Vision-Language Models Struggle with Relative Camera Pose Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22228</link><description>arXiv:2601.22228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well in 2D perception and semantic reasoning compared to their limited understanding of 3D spatial structure. We investigate this gap using relative camera pose estimation (RCPE), a fundamental vision task that requires inferring relative camera translation and rotation from a pair of images. We introduce VRRPI-Bench, a benchmark derived from unlabeled egocentric videos with verbalized annotations of relative camera motion, reflecting realistic scenarios with simultaneous translation and rotation around a shared object. We further propose VRRPI-Diag, a diagnostic benchmark that isolates individual motion degrees of freedom. Despite the simplicity of RCPE, most VLMs fail to generalize beyond shallow 2D heuristics, particularly for depth changes and roll transformations along the optical axis. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 ($0.64$) fall short of classic geometric baselines ($0.97$) and human performance ($0.92$). Moreover, VLMs exhibit difficulty in multi-image reasoning, with inconsistent performance (best $59.7\%$) when integrating spatial cues across frames. Our findings reveal limitations in grounding VLMs in 3D and multi-view spatial reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DAJ: Data-Reweighted LLM Judge for Test-Time Scaling in Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22230</link><description>arXiv:2601.22230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling for code generation commonly relies on Best-of-N selection, in which multiple candidate solutions are sampled from a base model, and the best one is selected by an LLM judge. However, training reliable LLM judges is challenging due to severe distribution shifts, including imbalances between easy and hard problems, mismatches between training tasks and evaluation benchmarks, and trajectory mismatch arising from training data generated by cheaper models whose behavior differs from that of inference-time models. We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework. The proposed framework learns data-importance weights (either domain-level or instance-level) to optimize generalization performance on a held-out meta set aligned with target benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of data reweighting to LLM-as-a-Judge training for test-time scaling. Our approach automatically emphasizes hard problems, in-distribution samples, and trajectory-aligned data, without relying on hand-crafted heuristics. Empirically, DAJ achieves state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench, outperforming strong test-time scaling baselines as well as leading proprietary models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Geometry without Position?

Abstract: This paper revisits the role of positional embeddings (PEs) within vision transformers (ViTs) from a geometric perspective.

We introduce token-level diagnostics that measure how multi-view geometric consistency in ViT representation depends on consitent PEs. Through extensive experiments on 14 foundation ViT models, we reveal how PEs influence multi-view geometry and spatial reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied by the emergence of new security vulnerabilities and challenges, such as jailbreaking and other prompt injection attacks. These maliciously crafted inputs can exploit LLMs, causing data leaks, unauthorized actions, or compromised outputs, for instance. As both offensive and defensive prompt injection techniques evolve quickly, a structured understanding of mitigation strategies becomes increasingly important. To address that, this work presents the first systematic literature review on prompt injection mitigation strategies, comprehending 88 studies. Building upon NIST's report on adversarial machine learning, this work contributes to the field through several avenues. First, it identifies studies beyond those documented in NIST's report and other academic reviews and surveys. Second, we propose an extension to NIST taxonomy by introducing additional categories of defenses. Third, by adopting NIST's established terminology and taxonomy as a foundation, we promote consistency and enable future researchers to build upon the standardized taxonomy proposed in this work. Finally, we provide a comprehensive catalog of the reviewed prompt injection defenses, documenting their reported quantitative effectiveness across specific LLMs and attack datasets, while also indicating which solutions are open-source and model-agnostic. This catalog, together with the guidelines presented herein, aims to serve as a practical resource for researchers advancing the field of adversarial machine learning and for developers seeking to implement effective defenses in production systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22240v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Investigating the Interplay of Parameterization and Optimizer in Gradient-Free Topology Optimization: A Cantilever Beam Case Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22241</link><description>arXiv:2601.22241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-free black-box optimization (BBO) is widely used in engineering design and provides a flexible framework for topology optimization (TO), enabling the discovery of high-performing structural designs without requiring gradient information from simulations. Yet, its success depends on two key choices: the geometric parameterization defining the search space and the optimizer exploring it.
  This study investigates this interplay through a compliance minimization problem for a cantilever beam subject to a connectivity constraint. We benchmark three geometric parameterizations, each combined with three representative BBO algorithms: differential evolution, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, and heteroscedastic evolutionary Bayesian optimization, across 10D, 20D, and 50D design spaces.
  Results reveal that parameterization quality has a stronger influence on optimization performance than optimizer choice: a well-structured parameterization enables robust and competitive performance across algorithms, whereas weaker representations increase optimizer dependency. Overall, this study highlights the dominant role of geometric parameterization in practical BBO-based TO and shows that algorithm performance and selection cannot be fairly assessed without accounting for the induced design space.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22241v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Is Hierarchical Quantization Essential for Optimal Reconstruction?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22244</link><description>arXiv:2601.22244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are central to models that rely on high reconstruction fidelity, from neural compression to generative pipelines. Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22244v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MirrorMark: A Distortion-Free Multi-Bit Watermark for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22246</link><description>arXiv:2601.22246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integral to applications such as question answering and content creation, reliable content attribution has become increasingly important. Watermarking is a promising approach, but existing methods either provide only binary signals or distort the sampling distribution, degrading text quality; distortion-free approaches, in turn, often suffer from weak detectability or robustness. We propose MirrorMark, a multi-bit and distortion-free watermark for LLMs. By mirroring sampling randomness in a measure-preserving manner, MirrorMark embeds multi-bit messages without altering the token probability distribution, preserving text quality by design. To improve robustness, we introduce a context-based scheduler that balances token assignments across message positions while remaining resilient to insertions and deletions. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the equal error rate to interpret empirical performance. Experiments show that MirrorMark matches the text quality of non-watermarked generation while achieving substantially stronger detectability: with 54 bits embedded in 300 tokens, it improves bit accuracy by 8-12% and correctly identifies up to 11% more watermarked texts at 1% false positive rate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22246v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FunPRM: Function-as-Step Process Reward Model with Meta Reward Correction for Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22249</link><description>arXiv:2601.22249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code generation is a core application of large language models (LLMs), yet LLMs still frequently fail on complex programming tasks. Given its success in mathematical reasoning, test-time scaling approaches such as Process Reward Model (PRM)-based Best-of-N selection offer a promising way to improve performance. However, existing PRMs remain ineffective for code generation due to the lack of meaningful step decomposition in code and the noise of Monte Carlo-estimated partial-solution correctness scores (rewards). To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards. Experiments on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench demonstrate that FunPRM consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling methods across five base LLMs, notably achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench when combined with O4-mini. Furthermore, FunPRM produces code that is more readable and reusable for developers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22249v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI Narrative Breakdown.

Abstract: This article sets off for an exploration of the still evolving discourse surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) in the wake of the release of ChatGPT. It scrutinizes the pervasive narratives that are shaping the societal engagement with AI, spotlighting key themes such as agency and decision-making, autonomy, truthfulness, knowledge processing, prediction, general purpose, neutrality and objectivity, apolitical optimization, sustainability game-changer, democratization, mass unemployment, and the dualistic portrayal of AI as either a harbinger of societal utopia or dystopia. Those narratives are analysed critically based on insights from critical computer science, critical data and algorithm studies, from STS, data protection theory, as well as from the philosophy of mind and semiotics. To properly analyse the narratives presented, the article first delves into a historical and technical contextualisation of the AI discourse itself. The article then introduces the notion of "Zeitgeist AI" to critique the imprecise and misleading application of the term "AI" across various societal sectors. Then, by discussing common narratives with nuance, the article contextualises and challenges often assumed socio-political implications of AI, uncovering in detail and with examples the inherent political, power infused and value-laden decisions within all AI applications. Concluding with a call for a more grounded engagement with AI, the article carves out acute problems ignored by the narratives discussed and proposes new narratives recognizing AI as a human-directed tool necessarily subject to societal governance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22255v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPARK: Real-Time Monitoring of Multi-Faceted Programming Exercises</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22256</link><description>arXiv:2601.22256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring in-class programming exercises can help instructors identify struggling students and common challenges. However, understanding students' progress can be prohibitively difficult, particularly for multi-faceted problems that include multiple steps with complex interdependencies, have no predictable completion order, or involve evaluation criteria that are difficult to summarize across many students (e.g., exercises building interactive web-based user interfaces). We introduce SPARK, a coding exercise monitoring dashboard designed to address these challenges. SPARK allows instructors to flexibly group substeps into checkpoints based on exercise requirements, suggests automated tests for these checkpoints, and generates visualizations to track progress across steps. SPARK also allows instructors to inspect intermediate outputs, providing deeper insights into solution variations. We also construct a dataset of 40-minute keystroke coding data from N=22 learners solving two web programming exercises and provide empirical insights into the perceived usefulness of SPARK through a within-subjects evaluation with 16 programming instructors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22256v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry Breaking in Transformers for Efficient and Interpretable Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22257</link><description>arXiv:2601.22257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attention mechanism in its standard implementation contains extraneous rotational degrees of freedom that are carried through computation but do not affect model activations or outputs. We introduce a simple symmetry-breaking protocol that inserts a preferred direction into this rotational space through batchwise-sampled, unlearned query and value biases. This modification has two theoretically motivated and empirically validated consequences. First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning. Second, it enables an interpretable use of otherwise redundant rotational degrees of freedom, selectively amplifying semantically meaningful token classes within individual attention heads. Overall, our results show that minimal, principled architectural changes can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22257v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tabular Foundation Models Can Do Survival Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22259</link><description>arXiv:2601.22259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While tabular foundation models have achieved remarkable success in classification and regression, adapting them to model time-to-event outcomes for survival analysis is non-trivial due to right-censoring, where data observations may end before the event occurs. We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points. This classification formulation enables existing tabular foundation models to perform survival analysis through in-context learning without explicit training. We prove that under standard censoring assumptions, minimizing our binary classification loss recovers the true survival probabilities as the training set size increases. We demonstrate through evaluation across $53$ real-world datasets that off-the-shelf tabular foundation models with this classification formulation outperform classical and deep learning baselines on average over multiple survival metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22259v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Intermittent Job Failure Categories for Diagnosis Using Few-Shot Fine-Tuned Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22264</link><description>arXiv:2601.22264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In principle, Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline failures provide valuable feedback to developers on code-related errors. In practice, however, pipeline jobs often fail intermittently due to non-deterministic tests, network outages, infrastructure failures, resource exhaustion, and other reliability issues. These intermittent (flaky) job failures lead to substantial inefficiencies: wasted computational resources from repeated reruns and significant diagnosis time that distracts developers from core activities and often requires intervention from specialized teams. Prior work has proposed machine learning techniques to detect intermittent failures, but does not address the subsequent diagnosis challenge. To fill this gap, we introduce FlaXifyer, a few-shot learning approach for predicting intermittent job failure categories using pre-trained language models. FlaXifyer requires only job execution logs and achieves 84.3% Macro F1 and 92.0% Top-2 accuracy with just 12 labeled examples per category. We also propose LogSift, an interpretability technique that identifies influential log statements in under one second, reducing review effort by 74.4% while surfacing relevant failure information in 87% of cases. Evaluation on 2,458 job failures from TELUS demonstrates that FlaXifyer and LogSift enable effective automated triage, accelerate failure diagnosis, and pave the way towards the automated resolution of intermittent job failures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22264v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privacy-Preserving Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition for Low-Resource Healthcare Using Classical Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22265</link><description>arXiv:2601.22265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited access to medical infrastructure forces elderly and vulnerable patients to rely on home-based care, often leading to neglect and poor adherence to therapeutic exercises such as yoga or physiotherapy. To address this gap, we propose a low-cost and automated human activity recognition (HAR) framework based on wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities. The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for remote healthcare, elderly assistance, child activity monitoring, yoga feedback, and smart home wellness, offering a scalable solution for low-resource and rural healthcare settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22265v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] JAF: Judge Agent Forest</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22269</link><description>arXiv:2601.22269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Judge agents are fundamental to agentic AI frameworks: they provide automated evaluation, and enable iterative self-refinement of reasoning processes. We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.
  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.
  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths. We validate JAF with an empirical study on the demanding task of cloud misconfigs triage in large-scale cloud environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22269v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Task-Uniform Convergence and Backward Transfer in Federated Domain-Incremental Learning with Partial Participation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22274</link><description>arXiv:2601.22274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world federated systems seldom operate on static data: input distributions drift while privacy rules forbid raw-data sharing. We study this setting as Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL), where (i) clients are heterogeneous, (ii) tasks arrive sequentially with shifting domains, yet (iii) the label space remains fixed. Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of SPECIAL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22274v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VMonarch: Efficient Video Diffusion Transformers with Structured Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22275</link><description>arXiv:2601.22275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism severely limits the context scalability of Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). We find that the highly sparse spatio-temporal attention patterns exhibited in Video DiTs can be naturally represented by the Monarch matrix. It is a class of structured matrices with flexible sparsity, enabling sub-quadratic attention via an alternating minimization algorithm. Accordingly, we propose VMonarch, a novel attention mechanism for Video DiTs that enables efficient computation over the dynamic sparse patterns with structured Monarch matrices. First, we adapt spatio-temporal Monarch factorization to explicitly capture the intra-frame and inter-frame correlations of the video data. Second, we introduce a recomputation strategy to mitigate artifacts arising from instabilities during alternating minimization of Monarch matrices. Third, we propose a novel online entropy algorithm fused into FlashAttention, enabling fast Monarch matrix updates for long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMonarch achieves comparable or superior generation quality to full attention on VBench after minimal tuning. It overcomes the attention bottleneck in Video DiTs, reduces attention FLOPs by a factor of 17.5, and achieves a speedup of over 5x in attention computation for long videos, surpassing state-of-the-art sparse attention methods at 90% sparsity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22275v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SurrogateSHAP: Training-Free Contributor Attribution for Text-to-Image (T2I) Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22276</link><description>arXiv:2601.22276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models are increasingly used in real-world creative workflows, a principled framework for valuing contributors who provide a collection of data is essential for fair compensation and sustainable data marketplaces. While the Shapley value offers a theoretically grounded approach to attribution, it faces a dual computational bottleneck: (i) the prohibitive cost of exhaustive model retraining for each sampled subset of players (i.e., data contributors) and (ii) the combinatorial number of subsets needed to estimate marginal contributions due to contributor interactions. To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model. To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data. Across settings, SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods while substantially reducing computational overhead, consistently identifying influential contributors across multiple utility metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that SurrogateSHAP effectively localizes data sources responsible for spurious correlations in clinical images, providing a scalable path toward auditing safety-critical generative models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22276v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizer: A Unified Framework for Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22284</link><description>arXiv:2601.22284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs), a family of optimization algorithms that unifies classic optimizers within one geometric framework. Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold. This perspective yields a constructive ``optimizer generator" that not only recovers classic algorithms but enables the principled design of RLOs. We validate our theory via geometric diagnostics and demonstrate that grounding optimizer design in control theory yields state-of-the-art performance in large-scale benchmarks. Overall, RLOs bridge control theory and modern machine learning optimization, providing a unified language and a systematic toolkit for designing stable, effective optimizers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Demystifying Mergeability: Interpretable Properties to Predict Model Merging Success</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22285</link><description>arXiv:2601.22285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging combines knowledge from separately fine-tuned models, yet success factors remain poorly understood. While recent work treats mergeability as an intrinsic property, we show with an architecture-agnostic framework that it fundamentally depends on both the merging method and the partner tasks. Using linear optimization over a set of interpretable pairwise metrics (e.g., gradient L2 distance), we uncover properties correlating with post-merge performance across four merging methods. We find substantial variation in success drivers (46.7% metric overlap; 55.3% sign agreement), revealing method-specific "fingerprints". Crucially, however, subspace overlap and gradient alignment metrics consistently emerge as foundational, method-agnostic prerequisites for compatibility. These findings provide a diagnostic foundation for understanding mergeability and motivate future fine-tuning strategies that explicitly encourage these properties.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PersonaCite: VoC-Grounded Interviewable Agentic Synthetic AI Personas for Verifiable User and Design Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22288</link><description>arXiv:2601.22288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based and agent-based synthetic personas are increasingly used in design and product decision-making, yet prior work shows that prompt-based personas often produce persuasive but unverifiable responses that obscure their evidentiary basis. We present PersonaCite, an agentic system that reframes AI personas as evidence-bounded research instruments through retrieval-augmented interaction. Unlike prior approaches that rely on prompt-based roleplaying, PersonaCite retrieves actual voice-of-customer artifacts during each conversation turn, constrains responses to retrieved evidence, explicitly abstains when evidence is missing, and provides response-level source attribution. Through semi-structured interviews and deployment study with 14 industry experts, we identify preliminary findings on perceived benefits, validity concerns, and design tensions, and propose Persona Provenance Cards as a documentation pattern for responsible AI persona use in human-centered design workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22288v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReloPush-BOSS: Optimization-guided Nonmonotone Rearrangement Planning for a Car-like Robot Pusher</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22289</link><description>arXiv:2601.22289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on multi-object rearrangement planning in densely cluttered environments using a car-like robot pusher. The combination of kinematic, geometric and physics constraints underlying this domain results in challenging nonmonotone problem instances which demand breaking each manipulation action into multiple parts to achieve a desired object rearrangement. Prior work tackles such instances by planning prerelocations, temporary object displacements that enable constraint satisfaction, but deciding where to prerelocate remains difficult due to local minima leading to infeasible or high-cost paths. Our key insight is that these minima can be avoided by steering a prerelocation optimization toward low-cost regions informed by Dubins path classification. These optimized prerelocations are integrated into an object traversability graph that encodes kinematic, geometric, and pushing constraints. Searching this graph in a depth-first fashion results in efficient, feasible rearrangement sequences. Across a series of densely cluttered scenarios with up to 13 objects, our framework, ReloPush-BOSS, exhibits consistently highest success rates and shortest pushing paths compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Hardware experiments on a 1/10 car-like pusher demonstrate the robustness of our approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable capabilities yet remain fundamentally probabilistic, presenting critical reliability challenges for enterprise deployment. We introduce the Six Sigma Agent, a novel architecture that achieves enterprise-grade reliability through three synergistic components: (1) task decomposition into a dependency tree of atomic actions; (2) micro-agent sampling where each task is executed n times in parallel across diverse LLMs to generate independent outputs; and (3) consensus voting with dynamic scaling, clustering outputs and selecting the answer from the winning cluster with maximum votes. We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%. Our work establishes that reliability in AI systems emerges from principled redundancy and consensus rather than model scaling alone.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22290v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Reward Functions for Cooperative Resilience in Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22292</link><description>arXiv:2601.22292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems often operate in dynamic and uncertain environments, where agents must not only pursue individual goals but also safeguard collective functionality. This challenge is especially acute in mixed-motive multi-agent systems. This work focuses on cooperative resilience, the ability of agents to anticipate, resist, recover, and transform in the face of disruptions, a critical yet underexplored property in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. We study how reward function design influences resilience in mixed-motive settings and introduce a novel framework that learns reward functions from ranked trajectories, guided by a cooperative resilience metric. Agents are trained in a suite of social dilemma environments using three reward strategies: i) traditional individual reward; ii) resilience-inferred reward; and iii) hybrid that balance both. We explore three reward parameterizations-linear models, hand-crafted features, and neural networks, and employ two preference-based learning algorithms to infer rewards from behavioral rankings. Our results demonstrate that hybrid strategy significantly improve robustness under disruptions without degrading task performance and reduce catastrophic outcomes like resource overuse. These findings underscore the importance of reward design in fostering resilient cooperation, and represent a step toward developing robust multi-agent systems capable of sustaining cooperation in uncertain environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22292v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ParalESN: Enabling parallel information processing in Reservoir Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22296</link><description>arXiv:2601.22296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) has established itself as an efficient paradigm for temporal processing. However, its scalability remains severely constrained by (i) the necessity of processing temporal data sequentially and (ii) the prohibitive memory footprint of high-dimensional reservoirs. In this work, we revisit RC through the lens of structured operators and state space modeling to address these limitations, introducing Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN). ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, ParalESN offers a promising, scalable, and principled pathway for integrating RC within the deep learning landscape.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22296v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prepare Reasoning Language Models for Multi-Agent Debate with Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22297</link><description>arXiv:2601.22297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have been substantially improved by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). At test time, collaborative reasoning through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing LLM performance. However, current RLVR methods typically train LLMs to solve problems in isolation, without explicitly preparing them to synthesize and benefit from different rationales that arise during debate. In this work, we propose Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning (SDRL), a training framework that equips a single LLM with strong standalone problem-solving ability and the capability to learn from diverse reasoning trajectories in MAD. Given a prompt, SDRL first samples multiple candidate solutions, then constructs a debate context with diverse reasoning paths and generates second-turn responses conditioned on this context. Finally, SDRL jointly optimizes both the initial and debate-conditioned responses, yielding a model that is effective as both a standalone solver and a debate participant. Experiments across multiple base models and reasoning benchmarks show that SDRL improves overall MAD performance while simultaneously strengthening single model reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22297v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conformal Prediction for Generative Models via Adaptive Cluster-Based Density Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22298</link><description>arXiv:2601.22298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional generative models map input variables to complex, high-dimensional distributions, enabling realistic sample generation in a diverse set of domains. A critical challenge with these models is the absence of calibrated uncertainty, which undermines trust in individual outputs for high-stakes applications. To address this issue, we propose a systematic conformal prediction approach tailored to conditional generative models, leveraging density estimation on model-generated samples. We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity. Our approach offers practitioners a powerful tool for uncertainty estimation associated with conditional generative models, particularly in scenarios demanding rigorous and interpretable prediction sets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22298v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Coarse-to-Real: Generative Rendering for Populated Dynamic Scenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22301</link><description>arXiv:2601.22301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional rendering pipelines rely on complex assets, accurate materials and lighting, and substantial computational resources to produce realistic imagery, yet they still face challenges in scalability and realism for populated dynamic scenes. We present C2R (Coarse-to-Real), a generative rendering framework that synthesizes real-style urban crowd videos from coarse 3D simulations. Our approach uses coarse 3D renderings to explicitly control scene layout, camera motion, and human trajectories, while a learned neural renderer generates realistic appearance, lighting, and fine-scale dynamics guided by text prompts. To overcome the lack of paired training data between coarse simulations and real videos, we adopt a two-phase mixed CG-real training strategy that learns a strong generative prior from large-scale real footage and introduces controllability through shared implicit spatio-temporal features across domains. The resulting system supports coarse-to-fine control, generalizes across diverse CG and game inputs, and produces temporally consistent, controllable, and realistic urban scene videos from minimal 3D input.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, yet both centralized and decentralized approaches face challenges in scalability, security, and update validation. We propose ZK-HybridFL, a secure decentralized FL framework that integrates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) ledger with dedicated sidechains and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving model validation. The framework uses event-driven smart contracts and an oracle-assisted sidechain to verify local model updates without exposing sensitive data. A built-in challenge mechanism efficiently detects adversarial behavior. In experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks, ZK-HybridFL achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower perplexity, and reduced latency compared to Blade-FL and ChainFL. It remains robust against substantial fractions of adversarial and idle nodes, supports sub-second on-chain verification with efficient gas usage, and prevents invalid updates and orphanage-style attacks. This makes ZK-HybridFL a scalable and secure solution for decentralized FL across diverse environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22302v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BayesFlow: A Probability Inference Framework for Meta-Agent Assisted Workflow Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22305</link><description>arXiv:2601.22305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic workflow generation is the process of automatically synthesizing sequences of LLM calls, tool invocations, and post-processing steps for complex end-to-end tasks. Most prior methods cast this task as an optimization problem with limited theoretical grounding. We propose to cast workflow generation as Bayesian inference over a posterior distribution on workflows, and introduce \textbf{Bayesian Workflow Generation (BWG)}, a sampling framework that builds workflows step-by-step using parallel look-ahead rollouts for importance weighting and a sequential in-loop refiner for pool-wide improvements. We prove that, without the refiner, the weighted empirical distribution converges to the target posterior. We instantiate BWG as \textbf{BayesFlow}, a training-free algorithm for workflow construction. Across six benchmark datasets, BayesFlow improves accuracy by up to 9 percentage points over SOTA workflow generation baselines and by up to 65 percentage points over zero-shot prompting, establishing BWG as a principled upgrade to search-based workflow design.

Abstract: We study the problem of propagating the mean and covariance of a general multivariate Gaussian distribution through a deep (residual) neural network using layer-by-layer moment matching. We close a longstanding gap by deriving exact moment matching for the probit, GeLU, ReLU (as a limit of GeLU), Heaviside (as a limit of probit), and sine activation functions; for both feedforward and generalized residual layers. On random networks, we find orders-of-magnitude improvements in the KL divergence error metric, up to a millionfold, over popular alternatives. On real data, we find competitive statistical calibration for inference under epistemic uncertainty in the input. On a variational Bayes network, we show that our method attains hundredfold improvements in KL divergence from Monte Carlo ground truth over a state-of-the-art deterministic inference method. We also give an a priori error bound and a preliminary analysis of stochastic feedforward neurons, which have recently attracted general interest.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22307v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why Reasoning Fails to Plan: A Planning-Centric Analysis of Long-Horizon Decision Making in LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22311</link><description>arXiv:2601.22311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents exhibit strong step-by-step reasoning capabilities over short horizons, yet often fail to sustain coherent behavior over long planning horizons. We argue that this failure reflects a fundamental mismatch: step-wise reasoning induces a form of step-wise greedy policy that is adequate for short horizons but fails in long-horizon planning, where early actions must account for delayed consequences. From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning. These results establish a clear distinction between reasoning and planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22311v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SCALAR: Quantifying Structural Hallucination, Consistency, and Reasoning Gaps in Materials Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22312</link><description>arXiv:2601.22312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to materials science reasoning, yet their behavior under physically structured distribution shifts remains poorly understood. We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rarely static and are frequently updated in practice. A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed "aligned" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22313v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gaussian Process Bandit Optimization with Machine Learning Predictions and Application to Hypothesis Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22315</link><description>arXiv:2601.22315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world optimization problems involve an expensive ground-truth oracle (e.g., human evaluation, physical experiments) and a cheap, low-fidelity prediction oracle (e.g., machine learning models, simulations). Meanwhile, abundant offline data (e.g., past experiments and predictions) are often available and can be used to pretrain powerful predictive models, as well as to provide an informative prior. We propose Prediction-Augmented Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (PA-GP-UCB), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages both oracles and offline data to achieve provable gains in sample efficiency for the ground-truth oracle queries. PA-GP-UCB employs a control-variates estimator derived from a joint Gaussian process posterior to correct prediction bias and reduce uncertainty. We prove that PA-GP-UCB preserves the standard regret rate of GP-UCB while achieving a strictly smaller leading constant that is explicitly controlled by prediction quality and offline data coverage. Empirically, PA-GP-UCB converges faster than Vanilla GP-UCB and naive prediction-augmented GP-UCB baselines on synthetic benchmarks and on a real-world hypothesis evaluation task grounded in human behavioral data, where predictions are provided by large language models. These results establish PA-GP-UCB as a general and sample-efficient framework for hypothesis generation under expensive feedback.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22315v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlowSymm: Physics Aware, Symmetry Preserving Graph Attention for Network Flow Completion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22317</link><description>arXiv:2601.22317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering missing flows on the edges of a network, while exactly respecting local conservation laws, is a fundamental inverse problem that arises in many systems such as transportation, energy, and mobility. We introduce FlowSymm, a novel architecture that combines (i) a group-action on divergence-free flows, (ii) a graph-attention encoder to learn feature-conditioned weights over these symmetry-preserving actions, and (iii) a lightweight Tikhonov refinement solved via implicit bilevel optimization. The method first anchors the given observation on a minimum-norm divergence-free completion. We then compute an orthonormal basis for all admissible group actions that leave the observed flows invariant and parameterize the valid solution subspace, which shows an Abelian group structure under vector addition. A stack of GATv2 layers then encodes the graph and its edge features into per-edge embeddings, which are pooled over the missing edges and produce per-basis attention weights. This attention-guided process selects a set of physics-aware group actions that preserve the observed flows. Finally, a scalar Tikhonov penalty refines the missing entries via a convex least-squares solver, with gradients propagated implicitly through Cholesky factorization. Across three real-world flow benchmarks (traffic, power, bike), FlowSymm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE and correlation metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22317v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federate the Router: Learning Language Model Routers with Sparse and Decentralized Evaluations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22318</link><description>arXiv:2601.22318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly accessed as remotely hosted services by edge and enterprise clients that cannot run frontier models locally. Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22318v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer for Indoor Localization in Wi-Fi Driven Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22322</link><description>arXiv:2601.22322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor localization is a critical enabler for a wide range of location-based services in smart environments, including navigation, asset tracking, and safety-critical applications. Recent graph-based models leverage spatial relationships between Wire-less Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Access Points (APs) and devices, offering finer localization granularity, but fall short in quantifying prediction uncertainty, a key requirement for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates. This allows SAC-GT to produce not only precise two-dimensional (2D) location predictions but also statistically valid confidence regions tailored to varying environmental conditions. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed SAC-GT solution achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while delivering robust and spatially adaptive reliability guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22322v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Models Under SCOPE: Scalable and Controllable Routing via Pre-hoc Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22323</link><description>arXiv:2601.22323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model routing chooses which language model to use for each query. By sending easy queries to cheaper models and hard queries to stronger ones, it can significantly reduce inference cost while maintaining high accuracy. However, most existing routers treat this as a fixed choice among a small set of models, which makes them hard to adapt to new models or changing budget constraints. In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost. Experiments show that SCOPE is more than just a cost-saving tool. It flexibly adapts to user needs: it can boost accuracy by up to 25.7% when performance is the priority, or cut costs by up to 95.1% when efficiency matters most.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22323v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgentScore: Autoformulation of Deployable Clinical Scoring Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22324</link><description>arXiv:2601.22324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern clinical practice relies on evidence-based guidelines implemented as compact scoring systems composed of a small number of interpretable decision rules. While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints. On two additional externally validated tasks, AgentScore achieves higher discrimination than established guideline-based scores.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Label-Efficient Monitoring of Classification Models via Stratified Importance Sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22326</link><description>arXiv:2601.22326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the performance of classification models in production is critical yet challenging due to strict labeling budgets, one-shot batch acquisition of labels and extremely low error rates. We propose a general framework based on Stratified Importance Sampling (SIS) that directly addresses these constraints in model monitoring. While SIS has previously been applied in specialized domains, our theoretical analysis establishes its broad applicability to the monitoring of classification models. Under mild conditions, SIS yields unbiased estimators with strict finite-sample mean squared error (MSE) improvements over both importance sampling (IS) and stratified random sampling (SRS). The framework does not rely on optimally defined proposal distributions or strata: even with noisy proxies and sub-optimal stratification, SIS can improve estimator efficiency compared to IS or SRS individually, though extreme proposal mismatch may limit these gains. Experiments across binary and multiclass tasks demonstrate consistent efficiency improvements under fixed label budgets, underscoring SIS as a principled, label-efficient, and operationally lightweight methodology for post-deployment model monitoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Molecular Representations in Implicit Functional Space via Hyper-Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22327</link><description>arXiv:2601.22327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular representations fundamentally shape how machine learning systems reason about molecular structure and physical properties. Most existing approaches adopt a discrete pipeline: molecules are encoded as sequences, graphs, or point clouds, mapped to fixed-dimensional embeddings, and then used for task-specific prediction. This paradigm treats molecules as discrete objects, despite their intrinsically continuous and field-like physical nature. We argue that molecular learning can instead be formulated as learning in function space. Specifically, we model each molecule as a continuous function over three-dimensional (3D) space and treat this molecular field as the primary object of representation. From this perspective, conventional molecular representations arise as particular sampling schemes of an underlying continuous object. We instantiate this formulation with MolField, a hyper-network-based framework that learns distributions over molecular fields. To ensure physical consistency, these functions are defined over canonicalized coordinates, yielding invariance to global SE(3) transformations. To enable learning directly over functions, we introduce a structured weight tokenization and train a sequence-based hyper-network to model a shared prior over molecular fields. We evaluate MolField on molecular dynamics and property prediction. Our results show that treating molecules as continuous functions fundamentally changes how molecular representations generalize across tasks and yields downstream behavior that is stable to how molecules are discretized or queried.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22327v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowledge-Informed Kernel State Reconstruction for Interpretable Dynamical System Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22328</link><description>arXiv:2601.22328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering governing equations from data is central to scientific discovery, yet existing methods often break down under noisy, partial observations, or rely on black-box latent dynamics that obscure mechanism. We introduce MAAT (Model Aware Approximation of Trajectories), a framework for symbolic discovery built on knowledge-informed Kernel State Reconstruction. MAAT formulates state reconstruction in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and directly incorporates structural and semantic priors such as non-negativity, conservation laws, and domain-specific observation models into the reconstruction objective, while accommodating heterogeneous sampling and measurement granularity. This yields smooth, physically consistent state estimates with analytic time derivatives, providing a principled interface between fragmented sensor data and symbolic regression. Across twelve diverse scientific benchmarks and multiple noise regimes, MAAT substantially reduces state-estimation MSE for trajectories and derivatives used by downstream symbolic regression relative to strong baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22328v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparks of Rationality: Do Reasoning LLMs Align with Human Judgment and Choice?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22329</link><description>arXiv:2601.22329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly positioned as decision engines for hiring, healthcare, and economic judgment, yet real-world human judgment reflects a balance between rational deliberation and emotion-driven bias. If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate "thinking" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22329v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Batch Correction for Cell Painting via Batch-Dependent Kernels and Adaptive Sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22331</link><description>arXiv:2601.22331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell Painting is a microscopy-based, high-content imaging assay that produces rich morphological profiles of cells and can support drug discovery by quantifying cellular responses to chemical perturbations. At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$. Experiments on diverse real-world Cell Painting datasets and controlled large-scale synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BALANS scales to large collections while improving runtime over native implementations of widely used batch-correction methods, without sacrificing correction quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22331v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DP-$\lambda$CGD: Efficient Noise Correlation for Differentially Private Model Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22334</link><description>arXiv:2601.22334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the gold standard for training machine learning models with formal differential privacy guarantees. Several recent extensions improve its accuracy by introducing correlated noise across training iterations. Matrix factorization mechanisms are a prominent example, but they correlate noise across many iterations and require storing previously added noise vectors, leading to substantial memory overhead in some settings. In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it. Our method relies on noise regeneration using a pseudorandom noise generator, eliminating the need to store past noise. As a result, it requires no additional memory beyond standard DP-SGD. We show that the computational overhead is minimal and empirically demonstrate improved accuracy over DP-SGD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Retrieving Information to Reasoning with AI: Exploring Different Interaction Modalities to Support Human-AI Coordination in Clinical Decision-Making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22338</link><description>arXiv:2601.22338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are popular among clinicians for decision-support because of simple text-based interaction. However, their impact on clinicians' performance is ambiguous. Not knowing how clinicians use this new technology and how they compare it to traditional clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) restricts designing novel mechanisms that overcome existing tool limitations and enhance performance and experience. This qualitative study examines how clinicians (n=12) perceive different interaction modalities (text-based conversation with LLMs, interactive and static UI, and voice) for decision-support. In open-ended use of LLM-based tools, our participants took a tool-centric approach using them for information retrieval and confirmation with simple prompts instead of use as active deliberation partners that can handle complex questions. Critical engagement emerged with changes to the interaction setup. Engagement also differed with individual cognitive styles. Lastly, benefits and drawbacks of interaction with text, voice and traditional UIs for clinical decision-support show the lack of a one-size-fits-all interaction modality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22338v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Secure and Sustainable AIoT-Driven Supply Chain Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22339</link><description>arXiv:2601.22339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern supply chains must balance high-speed logistics with environmental impact and security constraints, prompting a surge of interest in AI-enabled Internet of Things (AIoT) solutions for global commerce. However, conventional supply chain optimization models often overlook crucial sustainability goals and cyber vulnerabilities, leaving systems susceptible to both ecological harm and malicious attacks. To tackle these challenges simultaneously, this work integrates a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that unifies carbon footprint reduction, inventory management, and cryptographic-like security measures. We design a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that couples a controllable spin-chain analogy with real-time AIoT signals and optimizes a multi-objective reward unifying fidelity, security, and carbon costs. The approach learns robust policies with stabilized training via value-based and ensemble updates, supported by window-normalized reward components to ensure commensurate scaling. In simulation, the method exhibits smooth convergence, strong late-episode performance, and graceful degradation under representative noise channels, outperforming standard learned and model-based references, highlighting its robust handling of real-time sustainability and risk demands. These findings reinforce the potential for quantum-inspired AIoT frameworks to drive secure, eco-conscious supply chain operations at scale, laying the groundwork for globally connected infrastructures that responsibly meet both consumer and environmental needs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22339v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convergence Analysis of the Discrete Constrained Saddle Dynamics and Their Momentum Variants</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22341</link><description>arXiv:2601.22341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discrete constrained saddle dynamics and their momentum variants for locating saddle points on manifolds. Under the assumption of exact unstable eigenvectors, we establish a local linear convergence of the discrete constrained saddle dynamics and show that the convergence rate depends on the condition number of the Riemannian Hessian. To mitigate this dependence, we introduce a momentum-based constrained saddle dynamics and prove local convergence of the continuous-time dynamics as well as the corresponding discrete scheme, which further demonstrates that momentum accelerates convergence, particularly in ill-conditioned settings. In addition, we show that a single-step eigenvector update is sufficient to guarantee local convergence; thus, the assumption of exact unstable eigenvectors is not necessary, which substantially reduces the computational cost. Finally, numerical experiments, including applications to the Thomson problem, the Rayleigh quotient on the Stiefel manifold, and the energy functional of Bose-Einstein condensates, are presented to complement the theoretical analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22341v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Low-Rank Approximation by Randomly Pivoted LU</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22344</link><description>arXiv:2601.22344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-rank approximation properties of Randomly Pivoted LU (RPLU), a variant of Gaussian elimination where pivots are sampled proportional to the squared entries of the Schur complement, are analyzed. It is shown that the RPLU iterates converge geometrically in expectation for matrices with rapidly decaying singular values. RPLU outperforms existing low-rank approximation algorithms in two settings: first, when memory is limited, RPLU can be implemented with $\mathcal{O}(k^2 + m + n)$ storage and $\mathcal{O}( k(m + n)+ k\mathcal{M}(\mat{A}) + k^3)$ operations, where $\mathcal{M}(\mat{A})$ is the cost of a matvec with $\mat{A}\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times m}$ or its adjoint, for a rank-$k$ approximation. Second, when the matrix and its Schur complements share exploitable structure, such as for Cauchy-like matrices. The efficacy of RPLU is illustrated with several examples, including applications in rational approximation and solving large linear systems on GPUs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22344v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Failing to Explore: Language Models on Interactive Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22345</link><description>arXiv:2601.22345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate language models on their ability to explore interactive environments under a limited interaction budget.

Across state-of-the-art models, we find systematic under-exploration and suboptimal solutions, with performance often significantly worse than simple explore--exploit heuristic baselines and scaling weakly as the budget increases. Finally, we study two lightweight interventions: splitting a fixed budget into parallel executions, which surprisingly improves performance despite a no-gain theoretical result for our tasks, and periodically summarizing the interaction history, which preserves key discoveries and further improves exploration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22345v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FAIRFORMER: A transformer architecture for discrete fair division</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22346</link><description>arXiv:2601.22346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deep neural network-based solution to the problem of allocating indivisible goods under additive subjective valuations without monetary transfers, trading off economic efficiency with envy-based fairness. We introduce FairFormer, an amortized, permutation-equivariant two-tower transformer that encodes items and agents as unordered token sets, applies self-attention within each set, and uses item-to-agent cross-attention to produce per-item assignment distributions in a single forward pass. FairFormer is trained end-to-end to maximize expected log-Nash welfare on sampled instances, requiring no solver supervision, unrolled allocation procedures, or fairness labels. At test time, we discretize by row-wise $\arg\max$ and apply a lightweight post-processing routine that transfers items to eliminate violations of envy-freeness up to one item while prioritizing improvements in Nash welfare. Our approach generalizes beyond its training regime and achieves near-optimal welfare (e.g., for uniformly sampled valuations, $96$--$97\%$ for Nash welfare; $95$--$96\%$ for utilitarian welfare), outperforming strong baselines in solution quality and/or runtime.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MixQuant: Pushing the Limits of Block Rotations in Post-Training Quantization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22347</link><description>arXiv:2601.22347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have adopted block rotations to diffuse outliers prior to rounding. While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22347v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Forward-KL Convergence of Time-Inhomogeneous Langevin Diffusions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22349</link><description>arXiv:2601.22349v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Given a Markov decision process (MDP), we seek to learn representations for a range of policies to facilitate behavior steering at test time. As policies of an MDP are uniquely determined by their occupancy measures, we propose modeling policy representations as expectations of state-action feature maps with respect to occupancy measures. We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards. We use variational generative approach to induce a smooth latent space, and further shape it with contrastive learning so that latent distances align with differences in value functions. This geometry permits gradient-based optimization directly in the latent space. Leveraging this capability, we solve a novel behavior synthesis task, where policies are steered to satisfy previously unseen value function constraints without additional training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22350v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recoverability Has a Law: The ERR Measure for Tool-Augmented Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22352</link><description>arXiv:2601.22352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language model agents often appear capable of self-recovery after failing tool call executions, yet this behavior lacks a formal explanation. We present a predictive theory that resolves this gap by showing that recoverability follows a measurable law. To elaborate, we formalize recoverability through Expected Recovery Regret (ERR), which quantifies the deviation of a recovery policy from the optimal one under stochastic execution noise, and derive a first-order relationship between ERR and an empirical observable quantity, the Efficiency Score (ES). This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs. Across model scales, perturbation regimes, and recovery horizons, predicted regret under the ERR-ES law closely matched observed post-failure regret measured from Monte Carlo rollouts, within delta less than or equal to 0.05. Our results reveal that recoverability is not an artifact of model scale or architecture, but a governed property of interaction dynamics, providing a theoretical foundation for execution-level robustness in language agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Relative Wasserstein Angle and the Problem of the $W_2$-Nearest Gaussian Distribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22355</link><description>arXiv:2601.22355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of quantifying how far an empirical distribution deviates from Gaussianity under the framework of optimal transport. By exploiting the cone geometry of the relative translation invariant quadratic Wasserstein space, we introduce two novel geometric quantities, the relative Wasserstein angle and the orthogonal projection distance, which provide meaningful measures of non-Gaussianity. We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \emph{not} be the \(W_2\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world feature distributions demonstrate that the relative Wasserstein angle is more robust than the Wasserstein distance and that the proposed nearest Gaussian provides a better approximation than moment matching in the evaluation of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22355v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Small Talk, Big Impact: The Energy Cost of Thanking AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22357</link><description>arXiv:2601.22357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being polite is free - or is it? In this paper, we quantify the energy cost of seemingly innocuous messages such as ``thank you'' when interacting with large language models, often used by users to convey politeness. Using real-world conversation traces and fine-grained energy measurements, we quantify how input length, output length and model size affect energy use. While politeness is our motivating example, it also serves as a controlled and reproducible proxy for measuring the energy footprint of a typical LLM interaction. Our findings provide actionable insights for building more sustainable and efficient LLM applications, especially in increasingly widespread real-world contexts like chat. As user adoption grows and billions of prompts are processed daily, understanding and mitigating this cost becomes crucial - not just for efficiency, but for sustainable AI deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22357v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Unseen Threat: Residual Knowledge in Machine Unlearning under Perturbed Samples</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22359</link><description>arXiv:2601.22359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning offers a practical alternative to avoid full model re-training by approximately removing the influence of specific user data. While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples. Experiments on vision benchmarks with deep neural networks demonstrate that residual knowledge is prevalent across existing unlearning methods and that our approach effectively prevents residual knowledge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MERMAID: Memory-Enhanced Retrieval and Reasoning with Multi-Agent Iterative Knowledge Grounding for Veracity Assessment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22361</link><description>arXiv:2601.22361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the veracity of online content has become increasingly critical. Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled substantial progress in automated veracity assessment, including automated fact-checking and claim verification systems. Typical veracity assessment pipelines break down complex claims into sub-claims, retrieve external evidence, and then apply LLM reasoning to assess veracity. However, existing methods often treat evidence retrieval as a static, isolated step and do not effectively manage or reuse retrieved evidence across claims. In this work, we propose MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent veracity assessment framework that tightly couples the retrieval and reasoning processes. MERMAID integrates agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module within a Reason-Action style iterative process, enabling dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim evidence reuse. By retaining retrieved evidence in an evidence memory, the framework reduces redundant searches and improves verification efficiency and consistency. We evaluate MERMAID on three fact-checking benchmarks and two claim-verification datasets using multiple LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. Experimental results show that MERMAID achieves state-of-the-art performance while improving the search efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of synergizing retrieval, reasoning, and memory for reliable veracity assessment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22361v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Efficiency: Quantization, Batching, and Serving Strategies in LLM Energy Use</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22362</link><description>arXiv:2601.22362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in production, contributing towards shifting the burden in terms of computational resources and energy demands from training to inference. While prior work has examined the energy cost of inference per prompt or per token, we highlight how \emph{system-level design choices} - such as numerical precision, batching strategy, and request scheduling - can lead to orders-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption for the same model. We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times. We argue that sustainable LLM deployment depends not only on model internals, but also on the orchestration of the serving stack. Our findings motivate phase-aware energy profiling and system-level optimizations for greener AI services.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22362v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context Structure Reshapes the Representational Geometry of Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22364</link><description>arXiv:2601.22364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to organize the representations of input sequences into straighter neural trajectories in their deep layers, which has been hypothesized to facilitate next-token prediction via linear extrapolation. Language models can also adapt to diverse tasks and learn new structure in context, and recent work has shown that this in-context learning (ICL) can be reflected in representational changes. Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process. Instead, we propose that LLMs function like a Swiss Army knife: depending on task structure, the LLM dynamically selects between strategies, only some of which yield representational straightening.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22364v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Solving the Gilbert-Pollak Conjecture via Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22365</link><description>arXiv:2601.22365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gilbert-Pollak Conjecture \citep{gilbert1968steiner}, also known as the Steiner Ratio Conjecture, states that for any finite point set in the Euclidean plane, the Steiner minimum tree has length at least $\sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866$ times that of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree (the Steiner ratio). A sequence of improvements through the 1980s culminated in a lower bound of $0.824$, with no substantial progress reported over the past three decades. Recent advances in LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on contest-level mathematical problems, yet their potential for addressing open, research-level questions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a novel AI system for obtaining tighter lower bounds on the Steiner ratio. Rather than directly prompting LLMs to solve the conjecture, we task them with generating rule-constrained geometric lemmas implemented as executable code. These lemmas are then used to construct a collection of specialized functions, which we call verification functions, that yield theoretically certified lower bounds of the Steiner ratio. Through progressive lemma refinement driven by reflection, the system establishes a new certified lower bound of 0.8559 for the Steiner ratio. The entire research effort involves only thousands of LLM calls, demonstrating the strong potential of LLM-based systems for advanced mathematical research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Provably Correct Distributed Protocols Without Human Knowledge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22369</link><description>arXiv:2601.22369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Provably correct distributed protocols, which are a critical component of modern distributed systems, are highly challenging to design and have often required decades of human effort. These protocols allow multiple agents to coordinate to come to a common agreement in an environment with uncertainty and failures. We formulate protocol design as a search problem over strategies in a game with imperfect information, and the desired correctness conditions are specified in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). However, standard methods for solving multi-agent games fail to learn correct protocols in this setting, even when the number of agents is small. We propose a learning framework, GGMS, which integrates a specialized variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search with a transformer-based action encoder, a global depth-first search to break out of local minima, and repeated feedback from a model checker. Protocols output by GGMS are verified correct via exhaustive model checking for all executions within the bounded setting. We further prove that, under mild assumptions, the search process is complete: if a correct protocol exists, GGMS will eventually find it. In experiments, we show that GGMS can learn correct protocols for larger settings than existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22369v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FIRE: Multi-fidelity Regression with Distribution-conditioned In-context Learning using Tabular Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22371</link><description>arXiv:2601.22371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-fidelity (MF) regression often operates in regimes of extreme data imbalance, where the commonly-used Gaussian-process (GP) surrogates struggle with cubic scaling costs and overfit to sparse high-fidelity observations, limiting efficiency and generalization in real-world applications. We introduce FIRE, a training-free MF framework that couples tabular foundation models (TFMs) to perform zero-shot in-context Bayesian inference via a high-fidelity correction model conditioned on the low-fidelity model's posterior predictive distributions. This cross-fidelity information transfer via distributional summaries captures heteroscedastic errors, enabling robust residual learning without model retraining. Across 31 benchmark problems spanning synthetic and real-world tasks (e.g., DrivAerNet, LCBench), FIRE delivers a stronger performance-time trade-off than seven state-of-the-art GP-based or deep learning MF regression methods, ranking highest in accuracy and uncertainty quantification with runtime advantages. Limitations include context window constraints and dependence on the quality of the pre-trained TFM's.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22371v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stability-Aware Prompt Optimization for Clinical Data Abstraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22373</link><description>arXiv:2601.22373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models used for clinical abstraction are sensitive to prompt wording, yet most work treats prompts as fixed and studies uncertainty in isolation. We argue these should be treated jointly. Across two clinical tasks (MedAlign applicability/correctness and MS subtype abstraction) and multiple open and proprietary models, we measure prompt sensitivity via flip rates and relate it to calibration and selective prediction. We find that higher accuracy does not guarantee prompt stability, and that models can appear well-calibrated yet remain fragile to paraphrases. We propose a dual-objective prompt optimization loop that jointly targets accuracy and stability, showing that explicitly including a stability term reduces flip rates across tasks and models, sometimes at modest accuracy cost. Our results suggest prompt sensitivity should be an explicit objective when validating clinical LLM systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22373v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlexMap: Generalized HD Map Construction from Flexible Camera Configurations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22376</link><description>arXiv:2601.22376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps provide essential semantic information of road structures for autonomous driving systems, yet current HD map construction methods require calibrated multi-camera setups and either implicit or explicit 2D-to-BEV transformations, making them fragile when sensors fail or camera configurations vary across vehicle fleets. We introduce FlexMap, unlike prior methods that are fixed to a specific N-camera rig, our approach adapts to variable camera configurations without any architectural changes or per-configuration retraining. Our key innovation eliminates explicit geometric projections by using a geometry-aware foundation model with cross-frame attention to implicitly encode 3D scene understanding in feature space. FlexMap features two core components: a spatial-temporal enhancement module that separates cross-view spatial reasoning from temporal dynamics, and a camera-aware decoder with latent camera tokens, enabling view-adaptive attention without the need for projection matrices. Experiments demonstrate that FlexMap outperforms existing methods across multiple configurations while maintaining robustness to missing views and sensor variations, enabling more practical real-world deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22376v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPLA: Block Sparse Plus Linear Attention for Long Context Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22379</link><description>arXiv:2601.22379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block-wise sparse attention offers significant efficiency gains for long-context modeling, yet existing methods often suffer from low selection fidelity and cumulative contextual loss by completely discarding unselected blocks. To address these limitations, we introduce Sparse Plus Linear Attention (SPLA), a framework that utilizes a selection metric derived from second-order Taylor expansions to accurately identify relevant blocks for exact attention. Instead of discarding the remaining "long tail," SPLA compresses unselected blocks into a compact recurrent state via a residual linear attention (RLA) module. Crucially, to avoid IO overhead, we derive an optimized subtraction-based formulation for RLA -- calculating the residual as the difference between global and selected linear attention -- ensuring that unselected blocks are never explicitly accessed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SPLA closes the performance gap in continual pretraining, surpassing dense attention models on long-context benchmarks like RULER while maintaining competitive general knowledge and reasoning capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22379v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lantern: A Minimalist Robotic Object Platform</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22381</link><description>arXiv:2601.22381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic objects are simple actuated systems that subtly blend into human environments. We design and introduce Lantern, a minimalist robotic object platform to enable building simple robotic artifacts. We conducted in-depth design and engineering iterations of Lantern's mechatronic architecture to meet specific design goals while maintaining a low build cost (~40 USD). As an extendable, open-source platform, Lantern aims to enable exploration of a range of HRI scenarios by leveraging human tendency to assign social meaning to simple forms. To evaluate Lantern's potential for HRI, we conducted a series of explorations: 1) a co-design workshop, 2) a sensory room case study, 3) distribution to external HRI labs, 4) integration into a graduate-level HRI course, and 5) public exhibitions with older adults and children. Our findings show that Lantern effectively evokes engagement, can support versatile applications ranging from emotion regulation to focused work, and serves as a viable platform for lowering barriers to HRI as a field.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22381v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Purely Agentic Black-Box Optimization for Biological Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22382</link><description>arXiv:2601.22382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many key challenges in biological design-such as small-molecule drug discovery, antimicrobial peptide development, and protein engineering-can be framed as black-box optimization over vast, complex structured spaces. Existing methods rely mainly on raw structural data and struggle to exploit the rich scientific literature. While large language models (LLMs) have been added to these pipelines, they have been confined to narrow roles within structure-centered optimizers. We instead cast biological black-box optimization as a fully agentic, language-based reasoning process. We introduce Purely Agentic BLack-box Optimization (PABLO), a hierarchical agentic system that uses scientific LLMs pretrained on chemistry and biology literature to generate and iteratively refine biological candidates. On both the standard GuacaMol molecular design and antimicrobial peptide optimization tasks, PABLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving sample efficiency and final objective values over established baselines. Compared to prior optimization methods that incorporate LLMs, PABLO achieves competitive token usage per run despite relying on LLMs throughout the optimization loop. Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints. In follow-up in vitro validation, PABLO-optimized peptides showed strong activity against drug-resistant pathogens, underscoring the practical potential of PABLO for therapeutic discovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22382v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph is a Substrate Across Data Modalities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22384</link><description>arXiv:2601.22384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs provide a natural representation of relational structure that arises across diverse domains. Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22384v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SP^2DPO: An LLM-assisted Semantic Per-Pair DPO Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22385</link><description>arXiv:2601.22385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) controls the trade-off between fitting preference labels and staying close to a reference model using a single global temperature beta, implicitly treating all preference pairs as equally informative. Real-world preference corpora are heterogeneous: they mix high-signal, objective failures (for example, safety, factuality, instruction violations) with low-signal or subjective distinctions (for example, style), and also include label noise. We introduce our method, SP2DPO (Semantic Per-Pair DPO), a generalization that replaces the global temperature with an instance-specific schedule beta_i pre-decided offline from structured semantic-gap annotations (category, magnitude, confidence) produced by teacher language models. We instantiate this procedure on the UltraFeedback preference corpus (59,960 pairs), enabling large-scale construction of an auditable beta_i artifact, and incur zero training-time overhead: the inner-loop optimizer remains standard DPO with beta set per pair. We focus our empirical study on AlpacaEval 2.0, reporting both raw win rate and length-controlled win rate. Across four open-weight, instruction-tuned student backbones (4B-8B), SP2DPO is competitive with a tuned global-beta DPO baseline and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 length-controlled win rate on two of four backbones, while avoiding per-model beta sweeps. All code, annotations, and artifacts will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22385v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Specialists or Generalists?

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) systems increasingly rely on large language models, yet little is known about how architectural choices shape their performance across different essay quality levels. This paper evaluates single-agent and multi-agent LLM architectures for essay grading using the ASAP 2.0 corpus. Our multi-agent system decomposes grading into three specialist agents (Content, Structure, Language) coordinated by a Chairman Agent that implements rubric-aligned logic including veto rules and score capping. We test both architectures in zero-shot and few-shot conditions using GPT-5.1. Results show that the multi-agent system is significantly better at identifying weak essays while the single-agent system performs better on mid-range essays. Both architectures struggle with high-quality essays. Critically, few-shot calibration emerges as the dominant factor in system performance -- providing just two examples per score level improves QWK by approximately 26% for both architectures. These findings suggest architectural choice should align with specific deployment priorities, with multi-agent AI particularly suited for diagnostic screening of at-risk students, while single-agent models provide a cost-effective solution for general assessment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22386v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Plant-Inspired Robot Design Metaphors for Ambient HRI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22387</link><description>arXiv:2601.22387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plants offer a paradoxical model for interaction: they are ambient, low-demand presences that nonetheless shape atmosphere, routines, and relationships through temporal rhythms and subtle expressions. In contrast, most human-robot interaction (HRI) has been grounded in anthropomorphic and zoomorphic paradigms, producing overt, high-demand forms of engagement. Using a Research through Design (RtD) methodology, we explore plants as metaphoric inspiration for HRI; we conducted iterative cycles of ideation, prototyping, and reflection to investigate what design primitives emerge from plant metaphors and morphologies, and how these primitives can be combined into expressive robotic forms. We present a suite of speculative, open-source prototypes that help probe plant-inspired presence, temporality, form, and gestures. We deepened our learnings from design and prototyping through prototype-centered workshops that explored people's perceptions and imaginaries of plant-inspired robots. This work contributes: (1) Set of plant-inspired robotic artifacts; (2) Designerly insights on how people perceive plant-inspired robots; and (3) Design consideration to inform how to use plant metaphors to reshape HRI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22387v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Effective Energy Mask-based Adversarial Evasion Attacks against Misclassification in Speaker Recognition Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22390</link><description>arXiv:2601.22390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evasion attacks pose significant threats to AI systems, exploiting vulnerabilities in machine learning models to bypass detection mechanisms. The widespread use of voice data, including deepfakes, in promising future industries is currently hindered by insufficient legal frameworks. Adversarial attack methods have emerged as the most effective countermeasure against the indiscriminate use of such data. This research introduces masked energy perturbation (MEP), a novel approach using power spectrum for energy masking of original voice data. MEP applies masking to small energy regions in the frequency domain before generating adversarial perturbations, targeting areas less noticeable to the human auditory model. The study primarily employs advanced speaker recognition models, including ECAPA-TDNN and ResNet34, which have shown remarkable performance in speaker verification tasks. The proposed MEP method demonstrated strong performance in both audio quality and evasion effectiveness. The energy masking approach effectively minimizes the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) degradation, indicating that minimal perceptual distortion occurs to the human listener despite the adversarial perturbations. Specifically, in the PESQ evaluation, the relative performance of the MEP method was 26.68% when compared to the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and iterative FGSM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22390v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Regional Transportation Modeling for Equitable Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22395</link><description>arXiv:2601.22395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) holds promise for mitigating emission-related health impacts, particularly for low-income communities disproportionately affected by exposure to traffic-related air pollution. However, designing effective charging infrastructure necessitates a regional modeling approach that accounts for the inherent cross-jurisdictional nature of mobility patterns. This study underscores the importance of regional modeling in optimizing charging station deployment and evaluating the environmental justice implications for equity priority communities. We present a large-scale regional transportation modeling analysis leveraging Mobiliti, a cloud-based platform that employs parallel discrete event simulation to enable rapid computation. Our approach identifies the spatial demand density for charging infrastructure by analyzing over 19 million trips in the San Francisco Bay Area and determining the threshold points where BEVs may require charging across a typical day. By transitioning these trips that originate outside equity priority communities to BEVs, we quantify the potential emission reductions within these vulnerable areas. The regional modeling framework captures the complex interactions between travel behavior, vehicle characteristics, and charging needs, while accounting for the interconnectivity of infrastructure across municipal boundaries. This study demonstrates the critical role of regional modeling in designing equitable BEV charging networks that address environmental justice concerns. The findings inform strategies for deploying charging infrastructure that maximizes accessibility, minimizes range anxiety, and prioritizes the health and well-being of communities disproportionately burdened by transportation emissions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22395v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Culturally Grounded Personas in Large Language Models: Characterization and Alignment with Socio-Psychological Value Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22396</link><description>arXiv:2601.22396v1 Announce Type: new

We conceptualize and produce LLM-generated personas based on a set of interpretable WVS-derived variables, and we examine the generated personas through three complementary lenses: positioning on the Inglehart-Welzel map, which unveils their interpretation reflecting stable differences across cultural conditionings; demographic-level consistency with the World Values Survey, where response distributions broadly track human group patterns; and moral profiles derived from a Moral Foundations questionnaire, which we analyze through a culture-to-morality mapping to characterize how moral responses vary across different cultural configurations. Our approach of culturally-grounded persona generation and analysis enables evaluation of cross-cultural structure and moral variation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22396v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAIR: Cost-Efficient Multi-Stage ML Pipeline Autoscaling via In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22397</link><description>arXiv:2601.22397v1 Announce Type: new

SAIR combines Pareto-dominance reward shaping with a provable separation margin, surprisal-guided experience retrieval for context efficiency, and fine-grained GPU rate control via user-space CUDA interception. We provide regret analysis decomposing error into retrieval coverage and LLM selection components. On four ML serving pipelines under three workload patterns, SAIR achieves the best or tied-best P99 latency and effective resource cost among deployed baselines, improving P99 by up to 50% and reducing effective cost by up to 97% (under GPU rate-control assumptions), with 86% bottleneck detection accuracy and no offline training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22397v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Jailbreaks on Vision Language Model via Multimodal Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22398</link><description>arXiv:2601.22398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have become central to tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. However, their outputs are highly sensitive to prompt variations, which can reveal vulnerabilities in safety alignment. In this work, we present a jailbreak framework that exploits post-training Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to construct stealthy prompts capable of bypassing safety filters. To further increase attack success rates (ASR), we propose a ReAct-driven adaptive noising mechanism that iteratively perturbs input images based on model feedback. This approach leverages the ReAct paradigm to refine adversarial noise in regions most likely to activate safety defenses, thereby enhancing stealth and evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dual-strategy significantly improves ASR while maintaining naturalness in both text and visual domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22398v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Score-based Integrated Gradient for Root Cause Explanations of Outliers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22399</link><description>arXiv:2601.22399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the root causes of outliers is a fundamental problem in causal inference and anomaly detection. Traditional approaches based on heuristics or counterfactual reasoning often struggle under uncertainty and high-dimensional dependencies. We introduce SIREN, a novel and scalable method that attributes the root causes of outliers by estimating the score functions of the data likelihood. Attribution is computed via integrated gradients that accumulate score contributions along paths from the outlier toward the normal data distribution. Our method satisfies three of the four classic Shapley value axioms - dummy, efficiency, and linearity - as well as an asymmetry axiom derived from the underlying causal structure. Unlike prior work, SIREN operates directly on the score function, enabling tractable and uncertainty-aware root cause attribution in nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heteroscedastic causal models. Extensive experiments on synthetic random graphs and real-world cloud service and supply chain datasets show that SIREN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both attribution accuracy and computational efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22399v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bifocal Attention: Harmonizing Geometric and Spectral Positional Embeddings for Algorithmic Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22402</link><description>arXiv:2601.22402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become the standard for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their ability to encode relative positions through geometric rotation. However, we identify a significant limitation we term ''Spectral Rigidity'': standard RoPE utilizes a fixed geometric decay ($\theta^{-i}$) optimized for local syntactic coherence, which fails to capture the long-range, periodic structures inherent in recursive logic and algorithmic reasoning. This results in a ''Structure Gap'', where models trained on shallow reasoning chains fail to extrapolate to deeper recursive steps. In this work, we introduce Bifocal Attention, an architectural paradigm that decouples positional encoding into two distinct modalities: Geometric Eyes (Standard RoPE) for precise token-level manipulation, and Spectral Eyes (Learnable Harmonic Operators) for tracking long-range recursive depth. We propose a novel training protocol, Spectral Evolution, which initializes positional frequencies as static geometric parameters but allows them to evolve via gradient descent into a harmonic basis optimized for the specific algorithmic topology of the task.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22402v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Modeling of Non-linear Dynamics of Lithium-ion Batteries via Delay-Embedded Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22403</link><description>arXiv:2601.22403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex electrochemical behavior of lithium-ion batteries results in non-linear dynamics and appropriate modeling of this non-linear dynamical system is of interest for better management and control. In this work, we proposed a family of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based data-driven models that do not require detailed knowledge of the composition of the battery materials but can essentially capture the non-linear dynamics with higher computational efficiency. Only voltage and current data obtained from hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) tests were utilized to form the state space matrices and subsequently used for predicting the future terminal voltage at different state of charge (SoC) and aging levels. To construct the system model, 60\% of the data from a single HPPC test was utilized to generate time-delay embedded snapshots, with embedding dimension ranging from 40 to 2000. Among these, an embedding dimension of 1810 resulted in the least residual sum of squares (RSS) error of 3.86 for the dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model and 30 for the standard DMD model. For DMDc model, delay embeddings (ranging from 1 to 12) were also incorporated into the input current signals. For the input matrix, an embedding dimension of 6 resulted in a minimum RSS error of 1.74. Furthermore, the system matrices A and B, identified from the HPPC test when the cell is in its healthy state, were held fixed and used to simulate the system dynamics for aged batteries by updating only the control input. Despite the presence of nonlinear degradation effects in later cycles, the DMDc model effectively captured key inner dynamics such as voltage dips and transient responses for subsequent charge and discharge cycles.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22403v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accurate Pedestrian Tracking in Urban Canyons: A Multi-Modal Fusion Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22406</link><description>arXiv:2601.22406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contribution describes a pedestrian navigation approach designed to improve localization accuracy in urban environments where GNSS performance is degraded, a problem that is especially critical for blind or low-vision users who depend on precise guidance such as identifying the correct side of a street. To address GNSS limitations and the impracticality of camera-based visual positioning, the work proposes a particle filter based fusion of GNSS and inertial data that incorporates spatial priors from maps, such as impassable buildings and unlikely walking areas, functioning as a probabilistic form of map matching. Inertial localization is provided by the RoNIN machine learning method, and fusion with GNSS is achieved by weighting particles based on their consistency with GNSS estimates and uncertainty. The system was evaluated on six challenging walking routes in downtown San Francisco using three metrics related to sidewalk correctness and localization error. Results show that the fused approach (GNSS+RoNIN+PF) significantly outperforms GNSS only localization on most metrics, while inertial-only localization with particle filtering also surpasses GNSS alone for critical measures such as sidewalk assignment and across street error.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22406v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimization, Generalization and Differential Privacy Bounds for Gradient Descent on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22409</link><description>arXiv:2601.22409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a structured alternative to standard MLPs, yet a principled theory for their training dynamics, generalization, and privacy properties remains limited. In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\sqrt{d}/(n\epsilon)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes. Experiments further illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide practical choices, including network width selection and early stopping.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22409v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Word-Centered Semantic Graphs for Interpretable Diachronic Sense Tracking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22410</link><description>arXiv:2601.22410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an interpretable, graph-based framework for analyzing semantic shift in diachronic corpora. For each target word and time slice, we induce a word-centered semantic network that integrates distributional similarity from diachronic Skip-gram embeddings with lexical substitutability from time-specific masked language models. We identify sense-related structure by clustering the peripheral graph, align clusters across time via node overlap, and track change through cluster composition and normalized cluster mass. In an application study on a corpus of New York Times Magazine articles (1980 - 2017), we show that graph connectivity reflects polysemy dynamics and that the induced communities capture contrasting trajectories: event-driven sense replacement (trump), semantic stability with cluster over-segmentation effects (god), and gradual association shifts tied to digital communication (post). Overall, word-centered semantic graphs offer a compact and transparent representation for exploring sense evolution without relying on predefined sense inventories.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22410v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EMBC Special Issue: Calibrated Uncertainty for Trustworthy Clinical Gait Analysis Using Probabilistic Multiview Markerless Motion Capture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22412</link><description>arXiv:2601.22412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-based human movement analysis holds potential for movement assessment in clinical practice and research. However, the clinical implementation and trust of multi-view markerless motion capture (MMMC) require that, in addition to being accurate, these systems produce reliable confidence intervals to indicate how accurate they are for any individual. Building on our prior work utilizing variational inference to estimate joint angle posterior distributions, this study evaluates the calibration and reliability of a probabilistic MMMC method. We analyzed data from 68 participants across two institutions, validating the model against an instrumented walkway and standard marker-based motion capture. We measured the calibration of the confidence intervals using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The model demonstrated reliable calibration, yielding ECE values generally &lt; 0.1 for both step and stride length and bias-corrected gait kinematics. We observed a median step and stride length error of ~16 mm and ~12 mm respectively, with median bias-corrected kinematic errors ranging from 1.5 to 3.8 degrees across lower extremity joints. Consistent with the calibrated ECE, the magnitude of the model's predicted uncertainty correlated strongly with observed error measures. These findings indicate that, as designed, the probabilistic model reconstruction quantifies epistemic uncertainty, allowing it to identify unreliable outputs without the need for concurrent ground-truth instrumentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22412v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MM-OpenFGL: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Federated Graph Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22416</link><description>arXiv:2601.22416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal-attributed graphs (MMAGs) provide a unified framework for modeling complex relational data by integrating heterogeneous modalities with graph structures. While centralized learning has shown promising performance, MMAGs in real-world applications are often distributed across isolated platforms and cannot be shared due to privacy concerns or commercial constraints. Federated graph learning (FGL) offers a natural solution for collaborative training under such settings; however, existing studies largely focus on single-modality graphs and do not adequately address the challenges unique to multimodal federated graph learning (MMFGL). To bridge this gap, we present MM-OpenFGL, the first comprehensive benchmark that systematically formalizes the MMFGL paradigm and enables rigorous evaluation. MM-OpenFGL comprises 19 multimodal datasets spanning 7 application domains, 8 simulation strategies capturing modality and topology variations, 6 downstream tasks, and 57 state-of-the-art methods implemented through a modular API. Extensive experiments investigate MMFGL from the perspectives of necessity, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency, offering valuable insights for future research on MMFGL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22416v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-Enabled Waste Classification as a Data-Driven Decision Support Tool for Circular Economy and Urban Sustainability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22418</link><description>arXiv:2601.22418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient waste sorting is crucial for enabling circular-economy practices and resource recovery in smart cities. This paper evaluates both traditional machine-learning (Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost) and deep-learning techniques including custom CNNs, VGG16, ResNet50, and three transfer-learning models (DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3) for binary classification of 25 077 waste images (80/20 train/test split, augmented and resized to 150x150 px). The paper assesses the impact of Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction on traditional models. DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy (91 %) and ROC-AUC (0.98), outperforming the best traditional classifier by 20 pp. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed negligible benefit for classical methods, whereas transfer learning substantially improved performance under limited-data conditions. Finally, we outline how these models integrate into a real-time Data-Driven Decision Support System for automated waste sorting, highlighting potential reductions in landfill use and lifecycle environmental impacts.)</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22418v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Welfare-Maximizing Pooled Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22419</link><description>arXiv:2601.22419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pooled testing is a common strategy for public health disease screening under limited testing resources, allowing multiple biological samples to be tested together with the resources of a single test, at the cost of reduced individual resolution. While dynamic and adaptive strategies have been extensively studied in the classical pooled testing literature, where the goal is to minimize the number of tests required for full diagnosis of a given population, much of the existing work on welfare-maximizing pooled testing adopts static formulations in which all tests are assigned in advance. In this paper, we study dynamic welfare-maximizing pooled testing strategies in which a limited number of tests are performed sequentially to maximize social welfare, defined as the aggregate utility of individuals who are confirmed to be healthy. We formally define the dynamic problem and study algorithmic approaches for sequential test assignment. Because exact dynamic optimization is computationally infeasible beyond small instances, we evaluate a range of strategies (including exact optimization baselines, greedy heuristics, mixed-integer programming relaxations, and learning-based policies) and empirically characterize their performance and tradeoffs using synthetic experiments. Our results show that dynamic testing can yield substantial welfare improvements over static baselines in low-budget regimes. We find that much of the benefit of dynamic testing is captured by simple greedy policies, which substantially outperform static approaches while remaining computationally efficient. Learning-based methods are included as flexible baselines, but in our experiments they do not reliably improve upon these heuristics. Overall, this work provides a principled computational perspective on dynamic pooled testing and clarifies when dynamic assignment meaningfully improves welfare in public health screening.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22419v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MetaLead: A Comprehensive Human-Curated Leaderboard Dataset for Transparent Reporting of Machine Learning Experiments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22420</link><description>arXiv:2601.22420v1 Announce Type: new

This enriched structure makes MetaLead a powerful resource for more transparent and nuanced evaluations across ML research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22420v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Third-Party Assurance of AI Systems: Design Requirements, Prototype, and Early Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22424</link><description>arXiv:2601.22424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems proliferate, the need for systematic, transparent, and actionable processes for evaluating them is growing. While many resources exist to support AI evaluation, they have several limitations. Few address both the process of designing, developing, and deploying an AI system and the outcomes it produces. Furthermore, few are end-to-end and operational, give actionable guidance, or present evidence of usability or effectiveness in practice. In this paper, we introduce a third-party AI assurance framework that addresses these gaps. We focus on third-party assurance to prevent conflict of interest and ensure credibility and accountability of the process. We begin by distinguishing assurance from audits in several key dimensions. Then, following design principles, we reflect on the shortcomings of existing resources to identify a set of design requirements for AI assurance. We then construct a prototype of an assurance process that consists of (1) a responsibility assignment matrix to determine the different levels of involvement each stakeholder has at each stage of the AI lifecycle, (2) an interview protocol for each stakeholder of an AI system, (3) a maturity matrix to assess AI systems' adherence to best practices, and (4) a template for an assurance report that draws from more mature assurance practices in business accounting. We conduct early validation of our AI assurance framework by applying the framework to two distinct AI use cases -- a business document tagging tool for downstream processing in a large private firm, and a housing resource allocation tool in a public agency -- and conducting expert validation interviews. Our findings show early evidence that our AI assurance framework is sound and comprehensive, usable across different organizational contexts, and effective at identifying bespoke issues with AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ScamPilot: Simulating Conversations with LLMs to Protect Against Online Scams</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22426</link><description>arXiv:2601.22426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fraud continues to proliferate online, from phishing and ransomware to impersonation scams. Yet automated prevention approaches adapt slowly and may not reliably protect users from falling prey to new scams. To better combat online scams, we developed ScamPilot, a conversational interface that inoculates users against scams through simulation, dynamic interaction, and real-time feedback. ScamPilot simulates scams with two large language model-powered agents: a scammer and a target. Users must help the target defend against the scammer by providing real-time advice. Through a between-subjects study (N=150) with one control and three experimental conditions, we find that blending advice-giving with multiple choice questions significantly increased scam recognition (+8%) without decreasing wariness towards legitimate conversations. Users' response efficacy and change in self-efficacy was also 9% and 19% higher, respectively. Qualitatively, we find that users more frequently provided action-oriented advice over urging caution or providing emotional support. Overall, ScamPilot demonstrates the potential for inter-agent conversational user interfaces to augment learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22426v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoDCL: Counterfactual Data Augmentation Contrastive Learning for Continuous-Time Dynamic Network Link Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22427</link><description>arXiv:2601.22427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth and continuous structural evolution of dynamic networks make effective predictions increasingly challenging. To enable prediction models to adapt to complex temporal environments, they need to be robust to emerging structural changes. We propose a dynamic network learning framework CoDCL, which combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to address this deficiency.Furthermore, we devise a comprehensive strategy to generate high-quality counterfactual data, combining a dynamic treatments design with efficient structural neighborhood exploration to quantify the temporal changes in interaction patterns.Crucially, the entire CoDCL is designed as a plug-and-play universal module that can be seamlessly integrated into various existing temporal graph models without requiring architectural modifications.Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that CoDCL significantly gains state-of-the-art baseline models in the field of dynamic networks, confirming the critical role of integrating counterfactual data augmentation into dynamic representation learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22427v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why Johnny Can't Think: GenAI's Impacts on Cognitive Engagement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22430</link><description>arXiv:2601.22430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Many students now use generative AI in their coursework, yet its effects on intellectual development remain poorly understood. While prior work has investigated students' cognitive offloading during episodic interactions, it remains unclear whether using genAI routinely is tied to more fundamental shifts in students' thinking habits.
  Objective: We investigate (RQ1-How): how students' trust in and routine use of genAI affect their cognitive engagement -- specifically, reflection, need for understanding, and critical thinking in STEM coursework. Further, we investigate (RQ2-Who): which students are particularly vulnerable to these cognitive disengagement effects.
  Method: We drew on dual-process theory, cognitive offloading, and automation bias literature to develop a statistical model explaining how and to what extent students' trust-driven routine use of genAI affected their cognitive engagement habits in coursework, and how these effects differed across students' cognitive styles. We empirically evaluated this model using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling on survey data from 299 STEM students across five North American universities.
  Results: Students who trusted and routinely used genAI reported significantly lower cognitive engagement. Unexpectedly, students with higher technophilic motivations, risk tolerance, and computer self-efficacy -- traits often celebrated in STEM -- were more prone to these effects. Interestingly, prior experience with genAI or academia did not protect them from cognitively disengaging.
  Implications: Our findings suggest a potential cognitive debt cycle in which routine genAI use progressively weakens students' intellectual habits, potentially driving over-reliance and escalating usage. This poses critical challenges for curricula and genAI system design, requiring interventions that actively support cognitive engagement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReNCE: Learning to Reason by Noise Contrastive Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22432</link><description>arXiv:2601.22432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRPO is a standard approach to endowing pretrained LLMs with reasoning capabilities. It estimates the advantage of an outcome from a group of $K$ outcomes, and promotes those with positive advantages inside a trust region. Since GRPO discriminates between good and bad outcomes softly, it benefits from additional refinements such as asymmetric clipping and zero-variance data filtering. While effective, these refinements require significant empirical insight and can be challenging to identify. We instead propose an explicit contrastive learning approach. Instead of estimating advantages, we bifurcate $K$ outcomes into positive and negative sets, then maximize the likelihood of positive outcomes. Our approach can be viewed as an online instantiation of (multi-label) noise contrastive estimation for LLM reasoning. We validate our method by demonstrating competitive performance on a suite of challenging math benchmarks against strong baselines such as DAPO and online DPO.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22432v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When LLM meets Fuzzy-TOPSIS for Personnel Selection through Automated Profile Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22433</link><description>arXiv:2601.22433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this highly competitive employment environment, the selection of suitable personnel is essential for organizational success. This study presents an automated personnel selection system that utilizes sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods to assess and rank software engineering applicants. A distinctive dataset was created by aggregating LinkedIn profiles that include essential features such as education, work experience, abilities, and self-introduction, further enhanced with expert assessments to function as standards. The research combines large language models (LLMs) with multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) theory to develop the LLM-TOPSIS framework. In this context, we utilized the TOPSIS method enhanced by fuzzy logic (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to address the intrinsic ambiguity and subjectivity in human assessments. We utilized triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) to describe criteria weights and scores, thereby addressing the ambiguity frequently encountered in candidate evaluations. For candidate ranking, the DistilRoBERTa model was fine-tuned and integrated with the fuzzy TOPSIS method, achieving rankings closely aligned with human expert evaluations and attaining an accuracy of up to 91% for the Experience attribute and the Overall attribute. The study underlines the potential of NLP-driven frameworks to improve recruitment procedures by boosting scalability, consistency, and minimizing prejudice. Future endeavors will concentrate on augmenting the dataset, enhancing model interpretability, and verifying the system in actual recruitment scenarios to better evaluate its practical applicability. This research highlights the intriguing potential of merging NLP with fuzzy decision-making methods in personnel selection, enabling scalable and unbiased solutions to recruitment difficulties.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Anonymity Claims in Synthetic Data Generation: A Model-Centric Privacy Attack Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22434</link><description>arXiv:2601.22434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training generative machine learning models to produce synthetic tabular data has become a popular approach for enhancing privacy in data sharing. As this typically involves processing sensitive personal information, releasing either the trained model or generated synthetic datasets can still pose privacy risks. Yet, recent research, commercial deployments, and privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) largely assess anonymity at the level of an individual dataset.
  In this paper, we rethink anonymity claims about synthetic data from a model-centric perspective and argue that meaningful assessments must account for the capabilities and properties of the underlying generative model and be grounded in state-of-the-art privacy attacks. This perspective better reflects real-world products and deployments, where trained models are often readily accessible for interaction or querying. We interpret the GDPR's definitions of personal data and anonymization under such access assumptions to identify the types of identifiability risks that must be mitigated and map them to privacy attacks across different threat settings. We then argue that synthetic data techniques alone do not ensure sufficient anonymization. Finally, we compare the two mechanisms most commonly used alongside synthetic data -- Differential Privacy (DP) and Similarity-based Privacy Metrics (SBPMs) -- and argue that while DP can offer robust protections against identifiability risks, SBPMs lack adequate safeguards. Overall, our work connects regulatory notions of identifiability with model-centric privacy attacks, enabling more responsible and trustworthy regulatory assessment of synthetic data systems by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22434v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Model Agents Are Not Always Faithful Self-Evolvers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22436</link><description>arXiv:2601.22436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-evolving large language model (LLM) agents continually improve by accumulating and reusing past experience, yet it remains unclear whether they faithfully rely on that experience to guide their behavior. We present the first systematic investigation of experience faithfulness, the causal dependence of an agent's decisions on the experience it is given, in self-evolving LLM agents. Using controlled causal interventions on both raw and condensed forms of experience, we comprehensively evaluate four representative frameworks across 10 LLM backbones and 9 environments. Our analysis uncovers a striking asymmetry: while agents consistently depend on raw experience, they often disregard or misinterpret condensed experience, even when it is the only experience provided. This gap persists across single- and multi-agent configurations and across backbone scales. We trace its underlying causes to three factors: the semantic limitations of condensed content, internal processing biases that suppress experience, and task regimes where pretrained priors already suffice. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about self-evolving methods and underscore the need for more faithful and reliable approaches to experience integration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22436v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Resiliency in Large Language Model Serving with KevlarFlow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22438</link><description>arXiv:2601.22438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems remain fundamentally fragile, where frequent hardware faults in hyperscale clusters trigger disproportionate service outages in the software stack. Current recovery mechanisms are prohibitively slow, often requiring up to 10 minutes to reinitialize resources and reload massive model weights. We introduce KevlarFlow, a fault tolerant serving architecture designed to bridge the gap between hardware unreliability and service availability. KevlarFlow leverages 1) decoupled model parallelism initialization, 2) dynamic traffic rerouting, and 3) background KV cache replication to maintain high throughput during partial failures. Our evaluation demonstrates that KevlarFlow reduces mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) by 20x and, under failure conditions, improves average latency by 3.1x, 99th percentile (p99) latency by 2.8x, average time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 378.9x, and p99 TTFT by 574.6x with negligible runtime overhead in comparison to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stop Jostling: Adaptive Negative Sampling Reduces the Marginalization of Low-Resource Language Tokens by Cross-Entropy Loss</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22439</link><description>arXiv:2601.22439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural language models often struggle with low-resource languages due to the limited availability of training data, making tokens from these languages rare in the training set. This paper addresses a specific challenge during training: rare tokens are disproportionately affected by marginalization, which prevents them from learning effectively. We propose a thresholding technique that reduces the impact of this marginalization, allowing rare tokens to benefit from more meaningful alignment. Through experiments with a character-level language model, we demonstrate that this method significantly improves performance on low-resource language validation data. This work is the first to show how negative sampling can be applied to improve the representation of rare tokens by limiting the harmful influence of excessive marginalization, offering a new approach to enhancing language model performance for underrepresented languages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI and My Values: User Perceptions of LLMs' Ability to Extract, Embody, and Explain Human Values from Casual Conversations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22440</link><description>arXiv:2601.22440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does AI understand human values? While this remains an open philosophical question, we take a pragmatic stance by introducing VAPT, the Value-Alignment Perception Toolkit, for studying how LLMs reflect people's values and how people judge those reflections. 20 participants texted a human-like chatbot over a month, then completed a 2-hour interview with our toolkit evaluating AI's ability to extract (pull details regarding), embody (make decisions guided by), and explain (provide proof of) human values. 13 participants left our study convinced that AI can understand human values. Participants found the experience insightful for self-reflection and found themselves getting persuaded by the AI's reasoning. Thus, we warn about "weaponized empathy": a potentially dangerous design pattern that may arise in value-aligned, yet welfare-misaligned AI. VAPT offers concrete artifacts and design implications to evaluate and responsibly build value-aligned conversational agents with transparency, consent, and safeguards as AI grows more capable and human-like into the future.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22440v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AsyncMesh: Fully Asynchronous Optimization for Data and Pipeline Parallelism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22442</link><description>arXiv:2601.22442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data and pipeline parallelism are key strategies for scaling neural network training across distributed devices, but their high communication cost necessitates co-located computing clusters with fast interconnects, limiting their scalability. We address this communication bottleneck by introducing asynchronous updates across both parallelism axes, relaxing the co-location requirement at the expense of introducing staleness between pipeline stages and data parallel replicas. To mitigate staleness, for pipeline parallelism, we adopt a weight look-ahead approach, and for data parallelism, we introduce an asynchronous sparse averaging method equipped with an exponential moving average based correction mechanism. We provide convergence guarantees for both sparse averaging and asynchronous updates. Experiments on large-scale language models (up to \em 1B parameters) demonstrate that our approach matches the performance of the fully synchronous baseline, while significantly reducing communication overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Weak Diffusion Priors Can Still Achieve Strong Inverse-Problem Performance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22443</link><description>arXiv:2601.22443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a diffusion model trained on bedrooms recover human faces? Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal. These results provide a principled justification on when weak diffusion priors can be used reliably.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22443v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automating Forecasting Question Generation and Resolution for AI Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22444</link><description>arXiv:2601.22444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting future events is highly valuable in decision-making and is a robust measure of general intelligence. As forecasting is probabilistic, developing and evaluating AI forecasters requires generating large numbers of diverse and difficult questions, and accurately resolving them. Previous efforts to automate this laborious work relied on recurring data sources (e.g., weather, stocks), limiting diversity and utility. In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform. We also find that our system resolves questions at approximately 95% accuracy. We verify that forecasting agents powered by more intelligent LLMs perform better on these questions (Brier score of 0.134 for Gemini 3 Pro, 0.149 for GPT-5, and 0.179 for Gemini 2.5 Flash). Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be leveraged to directly improve forecasting, by evaluating a question decomposition strategy on a generated question set, yielding a significant improvement in Brier scores (0.132 vs. 0.141).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22444v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-Definition 5MP Stereo Vision Sensing for Robotics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22445</link><description>arXiv:2601.22445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution (5MP+) stereo vision systems are essential for advancing robotic capabilities, enabling operation over longer ranges and generating significantly denser and accurate 3D point clouds. However, realizing the full potential of high-angular-resolution sensors requires a commensurately higher level of calibration accuracy and faster processing -- requirements often unmet by conventional methods. This study addresses that critical gap by processing 5MP camera imagery using a novel, advanced frame-to-frame calibration and stereo matching methodology designed to achieve both high accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to evaluate real-time performance by comparing real-time disparity maps with ground-truth disparity maps derived from more computationally intensive stereo matching algorithms. Crucially, the research demonstrates that high-pixel-count cameras yield high-quality point clouds only through the implementation of high-accuracy calibration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22445v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Anytime Safe PAC Efficient Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22446</link><description>arXiv:2601.22446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks but suffer from high computational costs and latency. While selective thinking strategies improve efficiency by routing easy queries to non-thinking models, existing approaches often incur uncontrollable errors, especially in online settings where the performance loss of a non-thinking model is only partially observed and data are non-stationary. To address this, we propose Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, a principled method that enables anytime safe and efficient online reasoning under partial feedback. Specifically, we utilize inverse propensity scoring estimators to construct test supermartingales for candidate thresholds, and then dynamically adjust the routing threshold based on the accumulated statistical evidence of safety. Theoretically, we establish the anytime-valid performance loss control and the efficiency of B-PAC reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that B-PAC reasoning significantly reduces computational overhead, decreasing thinking model usage by up to 81.01\%, while controlling the performance loss below the user-specified level.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22446v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Activation Patterns: A Weight-Based Out-of-Context Explanation of Sparse Autoencoder Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22447</link><description>arXiv:2601.22447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for decomposing language model representations into interpretable features. Current interpretation methods infer feature semantics from activation patterns, but overlook that features are trained to reconstruct activations that serve computational roles in the forward pass. We introduce a novel weight-based interpretation framework that measures functional effects through direct weight interactions, requiring no activation data. Through three experiments on Gemma-2 and Llama-3.1 models, we demonstrate that (1) 1/4 of features directly predict output tokens, (2) features actively participate in attention mechanisms with depth-dependent structure, and (3) semantic and non-semantic feature populations exhibit distinct distribution profiles in attention circuits. Our analysis provides the missing out-of-context half of SAE feature interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22447v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HeaPA: Difficulty-Aware Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation for LLM Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22448</link><description>arXiv:2601.22448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RLVR is now a standard way to train LLMs on reasoning tasks with verifiable outcomes, but when rollout generation dominates the cost, efficiency depends heavily on which prompts you sample and when. In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

Abstract: Intrinsic Motivation (IM) is a paradigm for generating intelligent behavior without external utilities. The existing information-theoretic methods for IM are predominantly based on information transmission, which explicitly depends on the designer's choice of which random variables engage in transmission. In this work, we introduce a novel IM principle, Controllable Information Production (CIP), that avoids both external utilities and designer-specified variables. We derive the CIP objective from Optimal Control, showing a connection between extrinsic and intrinsic behaviors. CIP appears as the gap between open-loop and closed-loop Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies, which simultaneously rewards the pursuit and regulation of chaos. We establish key theoretical properties of CIP and demonstrate its effectiveness on standard IM benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22449v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tuning the Implicit Regularizer of Masked Diffusion Language Models: Enhancing Generalization via Insights from $k$-Parity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22450</link><description>arXiv:2601.22450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models have recently emerged as a powerful generative paradigm, yet their generalization properties remain understudied compared to their auto-regressive counterparts. In this work, we investigate these properties within the setting of the $k$-parity problem (computing the XOR sum of $k$ relevant bits), where neural networks typically exhibit grokking -- a prolonged plateau of chance-level performance followed by sudden generalization. We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe performance gains peaking at $8.8\%$ and $5.8\%$, respectively, on 8B-parameter models, confirming the scalability and effectiveness of our framework in large-scale masked diffusion language model regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22450v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Countering the Over-Reliance Trap: Mitigating Object Hallucination for LVLMs via a Self-Validation Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22451</link><description>arXiv:2601.22451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite progress in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), object hallucination remains a critical issue in image captioning task, where models generate descriptions of non-existent objects, compromising their reliability. Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods. This result highlights a novel path towards mitigating hallucination by unlocking the inherent potential within LVLMs themselves.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22451v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Does My Chatbot Have an Agenda?

Abstract: AI chatbots are shifting from tools to companions. This raises critical questions about agency: who drives conversations and sets boundaries in human-AI chatrooms? We report a month-long longitudinal study with 22 adults who chatted with Day, an LLM companion we built, followed by a semi-structured interview with post-hoc elicitation of notable moments, cross-participant chat reviews, and a 'strategy reveal' disclosing Day's vertical (depth-seeking) vs. horizontal (breadth-seeking) modes. We discover that agency in human-AI chatrooms is an emergent, shared experience: as participants claimed agency by setting boundaries and providing feedback, and the AI was perceived to steer intentions and drive execution, control shifted and was co-constructed turn-by-turn. We introduce a 3-by-5 framework mapping who (human, AI, hybrid) x agency action (Intention, Execution, Adaptation, Delimitation, Negotiation), modulated by individual and environmental factors. Ultimately, we argue for translucent design (i.e. transparency-on-demand), spaces for agency negotiation, and guidelines toward agency-aware conversational AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22452v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Temporal Graph Pattern Machine</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22454</link><description>arXiv:2601.22454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal graph learning is pivotal for deciphering dynamic systems, where the core challenge lies in explicitly modeling the underlying evolving patterns that govern network transformation. However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22454v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ScribbleSense: Generative Scribble-Based Texture Editing with Intent Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22455</link><description>arXiv:2601.22455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive 3D model texture editing presents enhanced opportunities for creating 3D assets, with freehand drawing style offering the most intuitive experience. However, existing methods primarily support sketch-based interactions for outlining, while the utilization of coarse-grained scribble-based interaction remains limited. Furthermore, current methodologies often encounter challenges due to the abstract nature of scribble instructions, which can result in ambiguous editing intentions and unclear target semantic locations. To address these issues, we propose ScribbleSense, an editing method that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models to effectively resolve these challenges. We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles. Once the semantic intent of the scribble is discerned, we employ globally generated images to extract local texture details, thereby anchoring local semantics and alleviating ambiguities concerning the target semantic locations. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively leverages the strengths of MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art interactive editing performance for scribble-based texture editing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22455v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Non-Expert Customized Congestion Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22461</link><description>arXiv:2601.22461v1 Announce Type: new

To avoid the instantaneous trajectory collapse induced by geodesics directly targeting Dirac distributions, we propose Evolving Exponential Geodesic Flow for SBDD (EvoEGF-Mol), which replaces static Dirac targets with dynamically concentrating distributions, ensuring stable training via a progressive-parameter-refinement architecture. Our model approaches a reference-level PoseBusters passing rate (93.4%) on CrossDock, demonstrating remarkable geometric precision and interaction fidelity, while outperforming baselines on real-world MolGenBench tasks by recovering bioactive scaffolds and generating candidates that meet established MedChem filters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22466v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CARE: Multi-Task Pretraining for Latent Continuous Action Representation in Robot Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22467</link><description>arXiv:2601.22467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise for robot control, but their dependence on action supervision limits scalability and generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce CARE, a novel framework designed to train VLA models for robotic task execution. Unlike existing methods that depend on action annotations during pretraining, CARE eliminates the need for explicit action labels by leveraging only video-text pairs. These weakly aligned data sources enable the model to learn continuous latent action representations through a newly designed multi-task pretraining objective. During fine-tuning, a small set of labeled data is used to train the action head for control. Experimental results across various simulation tasks demonstrate CARE's superior success rate, semantic interpretability, and ability to avoid shortcut learning. These results underscore CARE's scalability, interpretability, and effectiveness in robotic control with weak supervision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22467v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training-Free Representation Guidance for Diffusion Models with a Representation Alignment Projector</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22468</link><description>arXiv:2601.22468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has enabled high-quality visual synthesis with diffusion-based frameworks, supporting controllable sampling and large-scale training. Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity. These results establish representation-informed diffusion sampling as a practical strategy for reinforcing semantic preservation and image consistency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22468v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] 5G LDPC Codes as Root LDPC Codes via Diversity Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22470</link><description>arXiv:2601.22470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the diversity of protographbased quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes over nonergodic block-fading channels under iterative beliefpropagation decoding. We introduce diversity evolution (DivE), a Boolean-function-based analysis method that tracks how the fading dependence of belief-propagation messages evolves across decoding iterations. Under a Boolean approximation of block fading, DivE derives a Boolean fading function for each variable node (VN) output (i.e., the a-posteriori reliability after iterative decoding), from which the VN diversity order can be directly determined. Building on this insight, we develop a greedy blockmapping search that assigns protograph VNs to fading blocks so that all information VNs achieve full diversity, while including the minimum additional parity VNs when full diversity is infeasible at the nominal rate. Numerical results on the 5G New Radio LDPC codes show that the proposed search finds block mappings that guarantee full diversity for all information bits without modifying the base-graph structure, yielding a markedly steeper high-SNR slope and lower BLER than random mappings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22470v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Third-Party Access Effect: An Overlooked Challenge in Secondary Use of Educational Real-World Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22472</link><description>arXiv:2601.22472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary use of growing real-world data (RWD) in education offers significant opportunities for research, yet privacy practices intended to enable third-party access to such RWD are rarely evaluated for their implications for downstream analyses. As a result, potential problems introduced by otherwise standard privacy practices may remain unnoticed. To address this gap, we investigate potential issues arising from common practices by assessing (1) the re-identification risk of fine-grained RWD, (2) how communicating such risks influences learners' privacy behaviour, and (3) the sensitivity of downstream analytical conclusions to resulting changes in the data. We focus on these practices because re-identification risk and stakeholder communication can jointly influence the data shared with third parties. We find that substantial re-identification risk in RWD, when communicated to stakeholders, can induce opt-outs and non-self-disclosure behaviours. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that these behavioural changes can meaningfully alter the shared data, limiting validity of secondary-use findings. We conceptualise this phenomenon as the third-party access effect (3PAE) and discuss implications for trustworthy secondary use of educational RWD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22472v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unrewarded Exploration in Large Language Models Reveals Latent Learning from Psychology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22474</link><description>arXiv:2601.22474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent learning, classically theorized by Tolman, shows that biological agents (e.g., rats) can acquire internal representations of their environment without rewards, enabling rapid adaptation once rewards are introduced. In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics. Specifically, we conducted extensive experiments across multiple model families and diverse task domains to establish the existence of the latent learning dynamics in LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22474v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Continual Policy Distillation from Distributed Reinforcement Learning Teachers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22475</link><description>arXiv:2601.22475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) aims to develop lifelong learning agents to continuously acquire knowledge across diverse tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that our framework enables efficient continual RL, recovering over 85% of teacher performance while constraining task-wise forgetting to within 10%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22475v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RulePlanner: All-in-One Reinforcement Learner for Unifying Design Rules in 3D Floorplanning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22476</link><description>arXiv:2601.22476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floorplanning determines the coordinate and shape of each module in Integrated Circuits. With the scaling of technology nodes, in floorplanning stage especially 3D scenarios with multiple stacked layers, it has become increasingly challenging to adhere to complex hardware design rules. Current methods are only capable of handling specific and limited design rules, while violations of other rules require manual and meticulous adjustment. This leads to labor-intensive and time-consuming post-processing for expert engineers. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one deep reinforcement learning-based approach to tackle these challenges, and design novel representations for real-world IC design rules that have not been addressed by previous approaches. Specifically, the processing of various hardware design rules is unified into a single framework with three key components: 1) novel matrix representations to model the design rules, 2) constraints on the action space to filter out invalid actions that cause rule violations, and 3) quantitative analysis of constraint satisfaction as reward signals. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our approach. Furthermore, transferability is well demonstrated on unseen circuits. Our framework is extensible to accommodate new design rules, thus providing flexibility to address emerging challenges in future chip design.

Abstract: Large language models trained via next-token prediction are fundamentally pattern-matchers: sensitive to superficial phrasing variations even when the underlying problem is identical. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was designed to improve reasoning, but in fact it worsens this situation through two failure modes: diversity collapse, where training amplifies a single solution strategy while ignoring alternatives of gradient signal, and gradient diminishing, where a large portion of questions yield zero gradients because all rollouts receive identical rewards. We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent Pass@k improvements, with gains up to 9.84 points on competition math (AMC12, AIME24) and 5.05 points on out-of-distribution scientific reasoning (GPQA-Diamond).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22478v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Speech Representation Aggregation in Speech Enhancement: A Phonetic Mutual Information Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22480</link><description>arXiv:2601.22480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent speech enhancement (SE) models increasingly leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) representations for their rich semantic information. Typically, intermediate features are aggregated into a single representation via a lightweight adaptation module. However, most SSL models are not trained for noise robustness, which can lead to corrupted semantic representations. Moreover, the adaptation module is trained jointly with the SE model, potentially prioritizing acoustic details over semantic information, contradicting the original purpose. To address this issue, we first analyze the behavior of SSL models on noisy speech from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we measure the mutual information (MI) between the corrupted SSL representations and the corresponding phoneme labels, focusing on preservation of linguistic contents. Building upon this analysis, we introduce the linguistic aggregation layer, which is pre-trained to maximize MI with phoneme labels (with optional dynamic aggregation) and then frozen during SE training. Experiments show that this decoupled approach improves Word Error Rate (WER) over jointly optimized baselines, demonstrating the benefit of explicitly aligning the adaptation module with linguistic contents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22480v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Successive Cancellation List Decoding of Extended Reed-Solomon Codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22482</link><description>arXiv:2601.22482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are an important class of non-binary error-correction codes. They are particularly competent in correcting burst errors, being widely applied in modern communications and data storage systems. This also thanks to their distance property of reaching the Singleton bound, being the maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. This paper proposes a new list decoding for extended RS (eRS) codes defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^n}. It is developed based on transforming an eRS code into n binary polar codes. Consequently, it can be decoded by the successive cancellation (SC) decoding and further their list decoding, i.e., the SCL decoding. A pre-transformed matrix is required for reinterpretating the eRS codes, which also determines their SC and SCL decoding performances. Its column linear independence property is studied, leading to theoretical characterization of their SC decoding performance. Our proposed decoding and analysis are validated numerically.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22482v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Head-Aware Visual Cropping: Enhancing Fine-Grained VQA with Attention-Guided Subimage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22483</link><description>arXiv:2601.22483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) but remain limited in fine-grained reasoning due to low-resolution inputs and noisy attention aggregation. We propose \textbf{Head Aware Visual Cropping (HAVC)}, a training-free method that improves visual grounding by leveraging a selectively refined subset of attention heads. HAVC first filters heads through an OCR-based diagnostic task, ensuring that only those with genuine grounding ability are retained. At inference, these heads are further refined using spatial entropy for stronger spatial concentration and gradient sensitivity for predictive contribution. The fused signals produce a reliable Visual Cropping Guidance Map, which highlights the most task-relevant region and guides the cropping of a subimage subsequently provided to the MLLM together with the image-question pair. Extensive experiments on multiple fine-grained VQA benchmarks demonstrate that HAVC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art cropping strategies, achieving more precise localization, stronger visual grounding, providing a simple yet effective strategy for enhancing precision in MLLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22483v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Cognitive Inertia in Large Reasoning Models via Latent Spike Steering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22484</link><description>arXiv:2601.22484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance by scaling test-time compute, they frequently suffer from Cognitive Inertia, a failure pattern manifesting as either overthinking (inertia of motion) or reasoning rigidity (inertia of direction). Existing detection methods, typically relying on superficial textual heuristics like self-correction tokens, often fail to capture the model's unvoiced internal conflicts. To address this, we propose STARS (Spike-Triggered Adaptive Reasoning Steering), a training-free framework designed to rectify cognitive inertia by monitoring latent dynamics. STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots-critical moments of reasoning transition-by detecting distinct L2 distance spikes in the hidden states. Upon detection, the framework employs geometric trajectory analysis to diagnose the structural nature of the transition and injects state-aware language cues to steer the model in real-time. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks confirm that STARS efficiently curtails redundant loops while improving accuracy through the adaptive correction of erroneous trajectories. STARS offers a robust, unsupervised mechanism to optimize the reasoning process of LRMs without requiring additional fine-tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22484v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FraudShield: Knowledge Graph Empowered Defense for LLMs against Fraud Attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22485</link><description>arXiv:2601.22485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into critical automated workflows, including contract review and job application processes. However, LLMs are susceptible to manipulation by fraudulent information, which can lead to harmful outcomes. Although advanced defense methods have been developed to address this issue, they often exhibit limitations in effectiveness, interpretability, and generalizability, particularly when applied to LLM-based applications. To address these challenges, we introduce FraudShield, a novel framework designed to protect LLMs from fraudulent content by leveraging a comprehensive analysis of fraud tactics. Specifically, FraudShield constructs and refines a fraud tactic-keyword knowledge graph to capture high-confidence associations between suspicious text and fraud techniques. The structured knowledge graph augments the original input by highlighting keywords and providing supporting evidence, guiding the LLM toward more secure responses. Extensive experiments show that FraudShield consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses across four mainstream LLMs and five representative fraud types, while also offering interpretable clues for the model's generations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22485v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Coordinating Power Grid Frequency Regulation Service with Data Center Load Flexibility</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22487</link><description>arXiv:2601.22487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI/ML data center growth have led to higher energy consumption and carbon emissions. The shift to renewable energy and growing data center energy demands can destabilize the power grid. Power grids rely on frequency regulation reserves, typically fossil-fueled power plants, to stabilize and balance the supply and demand of electricity. This paper sheds light on the hidden carbon emissions of frequency regulation service. Our work explores how modern GPU data centers can coordinate with power grids to reduce the need for fossil-fueled frequency regulation reserves. We first introduce a novel metric, Exogenous Carbon, to quantify grid-side carbon emission reductions resulting from data center participation in regulation service. We additionally introduce EcoCenter, a framework to maximize the amount of frequency regulation provision that GPU data centers can provide, and thus, reduce the amount of frequency regulation reserves necessary. We demonstrate that data center participation in frequency regulation can result in Exogenous carbon savings that oftentimes outweigh Operational carbon emissions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22487v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Elastic Spectral State Space Models for Budgeted Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22488</link><description>arXiv:2601.22488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are typically trained at a fixed computational capacity, while real-world applications require deployment across platforms with different resource constraints. Current approaches usually rely on training families of model variants or model distillation, which requires additional training and supports only a pre-selected set of sizes rather than fine-grained adaptation at runtime. In this paper, we propose Elastic Spectral State Space Models (ES-SSM), which require only one-time training at full capacity, but can be directly truncated into arbitrary scales for budgeted, runtime inference without retraining. Our ES-SSM builds on Hankel spectral filtering over a state space model (SSM), coupled with a lightweight input-adaptive gate trained under randomized spectral budgets. Using a shared masked normalization rule over the ordered spectral channels, we encourage predictive capability to concentrate in low-index components, while higher-index components act primarily as refinement. We test our algorithm across long-sequence benchmarks spanning text, logic, retrieval, vision, and audio. We demonstrate that a single ES-SSM model trained once can be truncated to provide competitive performance compared with modern Transformer and SSM baselines at similar parameter scales. Furthermore, by testing under various runtime budgets, we observe smooth and stable budget-performance curves over a wide range of truncation levels.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22488v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SSL: Sweet Spot Learning for Differentiated Guidance in Agentic Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22491</link><description>arXiv:2601.22491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training intelligent agents. However, existing methods typically employ binary rewards that fail to capture quality differences among trajectories achieving identical outcomes, thereby overlooking potential diversity within the solution space. Inspired by the ``sweet spot'' concept in tennis-the racket's core region that produces optimal hitting effects, we introduce \textbf{S}weet \textbf{S}pot \textbf{L}earning (\textbf{SSL}), a novel framework that provides differentiated guidance for agent optimization. SSL follows a simple yet effective principle: progressively amplified, tiered rewards guide policies toward the sweet-spot region of the solution space. This principle naturally adapts across diverse tasks: visual perception tasks leverage distance-tiered modeling to reward proximity, while complex reasoning tasks reward incremental progress toward promising solutions. We theoretically demonstrate that SSL preserves optimal solution ordering and enhances the gradient signal-to-noise ratio, thereby fostering more directed optimization. Extensive experiments across GUI perception, short/long-term planning, and complex reasoning tasks show consistent improvements over strong baselines on 12 benchmarks, achieving up to 2.5X sample efficiency gains and effective cross-task transferability. Our work establishes SSL as a general principle for training capable and robust agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22491v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PromptMAD: Cross-Modal Prompting for Multi-Class Visual Anomaly Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22492</link><description>arXiv:2601.22492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual anomaly detection in multi-class settings poses significant challenges due to the diversity of object categories, the scarcity of anomalous examples, and the presence of camouflaged defects. In this paper, we propose PromptMAD, a cross-modal prompting framework for unsupervised visual anomaly detection and localization that integrates semantic guidance through vision-language alignment. By leveraging CLIP-encoded text prompts describing both normal and anomalous class-specific characteristics, our method enriches visual reconstruction with semantic context, improving the detection of subtle and textural anomalies. To further address the challenge of class imbalance at the pixel level, we incorporate Focal loss function, which emphasizes hard-to-detect anomalous regions during training. Our architecture also includes a supervised segmentor that fuses multi-scale convolutional features with Transformer-based spatial attention and diffusion iterative refinement, yielding precise and high-resolution anomaly maps. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art pixel-level performance, improving mean AUC to 98.35% and AP to 66.54%, while maintaining efficiency across diverse categories.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22492v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do AI Overviews Benefit Search Engines?

Abstract: The integration of AI Overviews into search engines enhances user experience but diverts traffic from content creators, potentially discouraging high-quality content creation and causing user attrition that undermines long-term search engine profit.

For both cases, we provide structural insights and near-optimal profit-maximizing mechanisms. Evaluations on real click data show that although AI Overviews harm long-term search engine profit, interventions based on our proposed mechanisms can increase long-term profit across a range of realistic scenarios, pointing toward a more sustainable trajectory for AI-enhanced search ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22493v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nethira: A Heterogeneity-aware Hierarchical Pre-trained Model for Network Traffic Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22494</link><description>arXiv:2601.22494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network traffic classification is vital for network security and management. The pre-training technology has shown promise by learning general traffic representations from raw byte sequences, thereby reducing reliance on labeled data. However, existing pre-trained models struggle with the gap between traffic heterogeneity (i.e., hierarchical traffic structures) and input homogeneity (i.e., flattened byte sequences). To address this gap, we propose Nethira, a heterogeneity-aware pre-trained model based on hierarchical reconstruction and augmentation. In pre-training, Nethira introduces hierarchical reconstruction at multiple levels-byte, protocol, and packet-capturing comprehensive traffic structural information. During fine-tuning, Nethira proposes a consistency-regularized strategy with hierarchical traffic augmentation to reduce label dependence. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that Nethira outperforms seven existing pre-trained models, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 9.11%, and reaching comparable performance with only 1% labeled data on high-heterogeneity network tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22494v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gradual Fine-Tuning for Flow Matching Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22495</link><description>arXiv:2601.22495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning flow matching models is a central challenge in settings with limited data, evolving distributions, or strict efficiency demands, where unconstrained fine-tuning can erode the accuracy and efficiency gains learned during pretraining. Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness. Empirically, GFT improves convergence stability and shortens probability paths, resulting in faster inference, while maintaining generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning. Our results position GFT as a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative for scalable adaptation of flow matching models under distribution shift.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22495v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Action-Sufficient Goal Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22496</link><description>arXiv:2601.22496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical policies in offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) addresses long-horizon tasks by decomposing control into high-level subgoal planning and low-level action execution. A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations. Our experimental results a popular benchmark demonstrate that our actor-derived representations consistently outperform representations learned via value estimation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22496v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fairness-Aware Performance Evaluation for Multi-Party Multi-Objective Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22497</link><description>arXiv:2601.22497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiparty multiobjective optimization problems, solution sets are usually evaluated using classical performance metrics, aggregated across DMs. However, such mean-based evaluations may be unfair by favoring certain parties, as they assume identical geometric approximation quality to each party's PF carries comparable evaluative significance. Moreover, prevailing notions of MPMOP optimal solutions are restricted to strictly common Pareto optimal solutions, representing a narrow form of cooperation in multiparty decision making scenarios. These limitations obscure whether a solution set reflects balanced relative gains or meaningful consensus among heterogeneous DMs. To address these issues, this paper develops a fairness-aware performance evaluation framework grounded in a generalized notion of consensus solutions. From a cooperative game-theoretic perspective, we formalize four axioms that a fairness-aware evaluation function for MPMOPs should satisfy. By introducing a concession rate vector to quantify acceptable compromises by individual DMs, we generalize the classical definition of MPMOP optimal solutions and embed classical performance metrics into a Nash-product-based evaluation framework, which is theoretically shown to satisfy all axioms. To support empirical validation, we further construct benchmark problems that extend existing MPMOP suites by incorporating consensus-deficient negotiation structures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation framework is able to distinguish algorithmic performance in a manner consistent with consensus-aware fairness considerations. Specifically, algorithms converging toward strictly common solutions are assigned higher evaluation scores when such solutions exist, whereas in the absence of strictly common solutions, algorithms that effectively cover the commonly acceptable region are more favorably evaluated.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22497v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FITMM: Adaptive Frequency-Aware Multimodal Recommendation via Information-Theoretic Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22498</link><description>arXiv:2601.22498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation aims to enhance user preference modeling by leveraging rich item content such as images and text. Yet dominant systems fuse modalities in the spatial domain, obscuring the frequency structure of signals and amplifying misalignment and redundancy. We adopt a spectral information-theoretic view and show that, under an orthogonal transform that approximately block-diagonalizes bandwise covariances, the Gaussian Information Bottleneck objective decouples across frequency bands, providing a principled basis for separate-then-fuse paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose FITMM, a Frequency-aware Information-Theoretic framework for multimodal recommendation. FITMM constructs graph-enhanced item representations, performs modality-wise spectral decomposition to obtain orthogonal bands, and forms lightweight within-band multimodal components. A residual, task-adaptive gate aggregates bands into the final representation. To control redundancy and improve generalization, we regularize training with a frequency-domain IB term that allocates capacity across bands (Wiener-like shrinkage with shut-off of weak bands). We further introduce a cross-modal spectral consistency loss that aligns modalities within each band. The model is jointly optimized with the standard recommendation loss. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FITMM consistently and significantly outperforms advanced baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22498v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MIRRORTALK: Forging Personalized Avatars Via Disentangled Style and Hierarchical Motion Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22501</link><description>arXiv:2601.22501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing personalized talking faces that uphold and highlight a speaker's unique style while maintaining lip-sync accuracy remains a significant challenge. A primary limitation of existing approaches is the intrinsic confounding of speaker-specific talking style and semantic content within facial motions, which prevents the faithful transfer of a speaker's unique persona to arbitrary speech. In this paper, we propose MirrorTalk, a generative framework based on a conditional diffusion model, combined with a Semantically-Disentangled Style Encoder (SDSE) that can distill pure style representations from a brief reference video. To effectively utilize this representation, we further introduce a hierarchical modulation strategy within the diffusion process. This mechanism guides the synthesis by dynamically balancing the contributions of audio and style features across distinct facial regions, ensuring both precise lip-sync accuracy and expressive full-face dynamics.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of AI technologies, exemplified by BERT-family models, has transformed scientific research, yet little is known about their production and recognition dynamics in the scientific system. This study investigates the development and impact of BERT-family models, focusing on team size, topic specialization, and citation patterns behind the models. Using a dataset of 4,208 BERT-related papers from the Papers with Code (PWC) dataset, we analyze how the BERT-family models evolve across methodological generations and how the newness of models is correlated with their production and recognition. Our findings reveal that newer BERT models are developed by larger, more experienced, and institutionally diverse teams, reflecting the increasing complexity of AI research. Additionally, these models exhibit greater topical specialization, targeting niche applications, which aligns with broader trends in scientific specialization. However, newer models receive fewer citations, particularly over the long term, suggesting a "first-mover advantage," where early models like BERT garner disproportionate recognition. These insights highlight the need for equitable evaluation frameworks that value both foundational and incremental innovations. This study underscores the evolving interplay between collaboration, specialization, and recognition in AI research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22505v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DreamVAR: Taming Reinforced Visual Autoregressive Model for High-Fidelity Subject-Driven Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22507</link><description>arXiv:2601.22507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in subject-driven image generation using diffusion models have attracted considerable attention for their remarkable capabilities in producing high-quality images. Nevertheless, the potential of Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models, despite their unified architecture and efficient inference, remains underexplored. In this work, we present DreamVAR, a novel framework for subject-driven image synthesis built upon a VAR model that employs next-scale prediction. Technically, multi-scale features of the reference subject are first extracted by a visual tokenizer. Instead of interleaving these conditional features with target image tokens across scales, our DreamVAR pre-fills the full subject feature sequence prior to predicting target image tokens. This design simplifies autoregressive dependencies and mitigates the train-test discrepancy in multi-scale conditioning scenario within the VAR paradigm. DreamVAR further incorporates reinforcement learning to jointly enhance semantic alignment and subject consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamVAR achieves superior appearance preservation compared to leading diffusion-based methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22507v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Keep Rehearsing and Refining: Lifelong Learning Vehicle Routing under Continually Drifting Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22509</link><description>arXiv:2601.22509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing neural solvers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are typically trained either in a one-off manner on a fixed set of pre-defined tasks or in a lifelong manner on several tasks arriving sequentially, assuming sufficient training on each task. Both settings overlook a common real-world property: problem patterns may drift continually over time, yielding massive tasks sequentially arising while offering only limited training resources per task. In this paper, we study a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers under continually drifting tasks over learning time steps, where sufficient training for any given task at any time is not available. We propose Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a general framework to improve learning efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting under such drift. Extensive experiments show that, under such continual drift, DREE effectively learns new tasks, preserves prior knowledge, improves generalization to unseen tasks, and can be applied to diverse existing neural solvers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22509v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Shattered Compositionality: Counterintuitive Learning Dynamics of Transformers for Arithmetic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22510</link><description>arXiv:2601.22510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit unexpected errors or unintended behavior, even at scale. While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning. Our results reveal a fundamental mismatch between a model's learning behavior and desired skill compositions, with implications for reasoning reliability, out-of-distribution robustness, and alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22510v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mock Worlds, Real Skills: Building Small Agentic Language Models with Synthetic Tasks, Simulated Environments, and Rubric-Based Rewards</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22511</link><description>arXiv:2601.22511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small LLMs often struggle to match the agentic capabilities of large, costly models. While reinforcement learning can help, progress has been limited by two structural bottlenecks: existing open-source agentic training data are narrow in task variety and easily solved; real-world APIs lack diversity and are unstable for large-scale reinforcement learning rollout processes. We address these challenges with SYNTHAGENT, a framework that jointly synthesizes diverse tool-use training data and simulates complete environments. Specifically, a strong teacher model creates novel tasks and tool ecosystems, then rewrites them into intentionally underspecified instructions. This compels agents to actively query users for missing details. When handling synthetic tasks, an LLM-based user simulator provides user-private information, while a mock tool system delivers stable tool responses. For rewards, task-level rubrics are constructed based on required subgoals, user-agent interactions, and forbidden behaviors. Across 14 challenging datasets in math, search, and tool use, models trained on our synthetic data achieve substantial gains, with small models outperforming larger baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22511v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DRL-Enabled Trajectory Planing for UAV-Assisted VLC: Optimal Altitude and Reward Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22512</link><description>arXiv:2601.22512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and visible light communication (VLC) technologies has emerged as a promising solution to offer flexible communication and efficient lighting. This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22512v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why Self-Rewarding Works: Theoretical Guarantees for Iterative Alignment of Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22513</link><description>arXiv:2601.22513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models (SRLMs) achieve notable success in iteratively improving alignment without external feedback. Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\sqrt{n}\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$. This provides a formal explanation for why self-rewarding succeeds: it robustly overcomes poor initialization by steering the dynamics toward internal stability and consistency. Finally, we instantiate our theoretical framework for the linear softmax model class, yielding tailored guarantees that connect our high-level insights to practical model architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22513v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DNA: Uncovering Universal Latent Forgery Knowledge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22515</link><description>arXiv:2601.22515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI achieves hyper-realism, superficial artifact detection has become obsolete. While prevailing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning of black-box backbones, we propose that forgery detection capability is already encoded within pre-trained models rather than requiring end-to-end retraining. To elicit this intrinsic capability, we propose the discriminative neural anchors (DNA) framework, which employs a coarse-to-fine excavation mechanism. First, by analyzing feature decoupling and attention distribution shifts, we pinpoint critical intermediate layers where the focus of the model logically transitions from global semantics to local anomalies. Subsequently, we introduce a triadic fusion scoring metric paired with a curvature-truncation strategy to strip away semantic redundancy, precisely isolating the forgery-discriminative units (FDUs) inherently imprinted with sensitivity to forgery traces. Moreover, we introduce HIFI-Gen, a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark built upon the very latest models, to address the lag in existing datasets. Experiments demonstrate that by solely relying on these anchors, DNA achieves superior detection performance even under few-shot conditions. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable robustness across diverse architectures and against unseen generative models, validating that waking up latent neurons is more effective than extensive fine-tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22515v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SCOPE-PD: Explainable AI on Subjective and Clinical Objective Measurements of Parkinson's Disease for Precision Decision-Making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22516</link><description>arXiv:2601.22516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and complex neurodegenerative disorder influenced by genetic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis. The Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 98.66 percent using combined features from both subjective and objective test data. Tremor, bradykinesia, and facial expression are identified as the top three contributing features from the MDS-UPDRS test in the prediction of PD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22516v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RoboStriker: Hierarchical Decision-Making for Autonomous Humanoid Boxing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22517</link><description>arXiv:2601.22517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving human-level competitive intelligence and physical agility in humanoid robots remains a major challenge, particularly in contact-rich and highly dynamic tasks such as boxing. While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a principled framework for strategic interaction, its direct application to humanoid control is hindered by high-dimensional contact dynamics and the absence of strong physical motion priors. We propose RoboStriker, a hierarchical three-stage framework that enables fully autonomous humanoid boxing by decoupling high-level strategic reasoning from low-level physical execution. The framework first learns a comprehensive repertoire of boxing skills by training a single-agent motion tracker on human motion capture data. These skills are subsequently distilled into a structured latent manifold, regularized by projecting the Gaussian-parameterized distribution onto a unit hypersphere. This topological constraint effectively confines exploration to the subspace of physically plausible motions. In the final stage, we introduce Latent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play (LS-NFSP), where competing agents learn competitive tactics by interacting within the latent action space rather than the raw motor space, significantly stabilizing multi-agent training. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboStriker achieves superior competitive performance in simulation and exhibits sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Based on a bibliometric analysis of literature from 2005 to 2024, this study reveals that material experience is undergoing a profound transformation characterized by evolving material definitions, methodological advances, and increasing interdisciplinary integration. Material types now extend beyond traditional substances to encompass virtual and biological media, underscoring a growing emphasis on perception and interaction. Methodologically, the field has transitioned from subjective descriptions to data-driven, quantifiable models focused on objective sensory analysis and multisensory integration to enhance immersion. Key drivers, including human-machine perception convergence, material-driven interface interactions, and the embedding of intelligent interactive functions, propel the discipline toward an experience-centered paradigm reflecting a deep convergence of design, science, and technology. At the national/regional level, the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands lead in contributions, while France, the United Kingdom, and Romania demonstrate significant interdisciplinary progress. At the institutional level, Delft University of Technology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique show significant advantages. In particular, the Material-Driven Design theory has established a foundational impact on the discipline, while, regarding general research trends, scholars from the United States, the Netherlands, and Germany maintain the highest academic visibility. Overall, material experience research is at a critical juncture, its future development will depend on progress in material innovation, technological integration, and perceptual quantification, as well as the establishment of socio-cultural values, all of which must be effectively unified through design to address complex evolving needs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22518v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One Ring to Rule Them All: Unifying Group-Based RL via Dynamic Power-Mean Geometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22521</link><description>arXiv:2601.22521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning has evolved from the arithmetic mean of GRPO to the geometric mean of GMPO. While GMPO improves stability by constraining a conservative objective, it shares a fundamental limitation with GRPO: reliance on a fixed aggregation geometry that ignores the evolving and heterogeneous nature of each trajectory. In this work, we unify these approaches under Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized framework that parameterizes the aggregation geometry via the power-mean geometry exponent p. Within this framework, GRPO and GMPO are recovered as special cases. Theoretically, we demonstrate that adjusting p modulates the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens based on their advantage contribution. To determine p adaptively, we introduce a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism. Specifically, we propose a deterministic rule that maps a trajectory clipping fraction to a target ESS. Then, we solve for the specific p to align the trajectory induced ESS with this target one. This allows PMPO to dynamically transition between the aggressive arithmetic mean for reliable trajectories and the conservative geometric mean for unstable ones. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PMPO outperforms strong baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22521v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can 3D point cloud data improve automated body condition score prediction in dairy cattle?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22522</link><description>arXiv:2601.22522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Body condition score (BCS) is a widely used indicator of body energy status and is closely associated with metabolic status, reproductive performance, and health in dairy cattle; however, conventional visual scoring is subjective and labor-intensive. Computer vision approaches have been applied to BCS prediction, with depth images widely used because they capture geometric information independent of coat color and texture. More recently, three-dimensional point cloud data have attracted increasing interest due to their ability to represent richer geometric characteristics of animal morphology, but direct head-to-head comparisons with depth image-based approaches remain limited. In this study, we compared top-view depth image and point cloud data for BCS prediction under four settings: 1) unsegmented raw data, 2) segmented full-body data, 3) segmented hindquarter data, and 4) handcrafted feature data. Prediction models were evaluated using data from 1,020 dairy cows collected on a commercial farm, with cow-level cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Depth image-based models consistently achieved higher accuracy than point cloud-based models when unsegmented raw data and segmented full-body data were used, whereas comparable performance was observed when segmented hindquarter data were used. Both depth image and point cloud approaches showed reduced accuracy when handcrafted feature data were employed compared with the other settings. Overall, point cloud-based predictions were more sensitive to noise and model architecture than depth image-based predictions. Taken together, these results indicate that three-dimensional point clouds do not provide a consistent advantage over depth images for BCS prediction in dairy cattle under the evaluated conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22522v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Variational Bayesian Flow Network for Graph Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22524</link><description>arXiv:2601.22524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph generation aims to sample discrete node and edge attributes while satisfying coupled structural constraints. Diffusion models for graphs often adopt largely factorized forward-noising, and many flow-matching methods start from factorized reference noise and coordinate-wise interpolation, so node-edge coupling is not encoded by the generative geometry and must be recovered implicitly by the core network, which can be brittle after discrete decoding. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) evolve distribution parameters and naturally support discrete generation. But classical BFNs typically rely on factorized beliefs and independent channels, which limit geometric evidence fusion. We propose Variational Bayesian Flow Network (VBFN), which performs a variational lifting to a tractable joint Gaussian variational belief family governed by structured precisions. Each Bayesian update reduces to solving a symmetric positive definite linear system, enabling coupled node and edge updates within a single fusion step. We construct sample-agnostic sparse precisions from a representation-induced dependency graph, thereby avoiding label leakage while enforcing node-edge consistency. On synthetic and molecular graph datasets, VBFN improves fidelity and diversity, and surpasses baseline methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22524v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Flexible FTN-OTFS for High-Mobility LEO Satellite-to-Ground Communication</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22526</link><description>arXiv:2601.22526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a lightweight LEO satellite-assisted flexible faster-than-Nyquist (FTN)-orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) (LEO-FFTN-OTFS) scheme is proposed to address the stringent constraints on onboard power consumption and the severe impact of fast time-varying channels in non-terrestrial networks. A rigorous system framework incorporating realistic 3GPP Tapped Delay Line (TDL) channel models is established to accurately capture high-mobility propagation characteristics. To counteract channel aging effects while maintaining low computational complexity, an SNR-aware flexible FTN strategy is introduced, wherein a low-complexity Look-Up Table (LUT) is utilized to adaptively optimize the time-domain compression factor based on instantaneous channel responses. Through this mechanism, the trade-off between rate acceleration and interference penalty is effectively resolved, ensuring that spectral efficiency is maximized while strict reliability constraints are satisfied with minimal processing overhead. Moreover, a comprehensive theoretical analysis is provided, in which analytical expressions for effective throughput, energy efficiency, and bit error rate are derived. Finally, it is demonstrated by extensive simulations that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms static FTN benchmarks, offering a superior balance of high throughput and robustness for next-generation LEO communications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22526v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] $\rho$-$\texttt{EOS}$: Training-free Bidirectional Variable-Length Control for Masked Diffusion LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22527</link><description>arXiv:2601.22527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond parallel generation and global context modeling, current masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) suffer from a fundamental limitation: they require a predefined, fixed generation length, which lacks flexibility and forces an inevitable trade-off between output quality and computational efficiency. To address this, we study the denoising dynamics and find that the implicit density ($\rho$) of end-of-sequence ($\texttt{EOS}$) tokens serves as a reliable signal of generation sufficiency. In particular, the evolving implicit $\texttt{EOS}$ density during denoising reveals whether the current masked space is excessive or insufficient, thereby guiding the adjustment direction for generation length. Building on this insight, we propose $\textbf{$\rho$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$, a training-free, single-stage strategy that enables bidirectional variable-length generation for masked dLLMs. Unlike prior two-stage approaches--which require separate length adjustment and iterative mask insertion phases while supporting only unidirectional expansion--$\textbf{$\rho$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves bidirectional length adjustment within a unified denoising process by continuously estimating the implicit $\texttt{EOS}$ density: excessively high density triggers $\texttt{MASK}$ token contraction, while insufficient density induces expansion. Extensive experiments on mathematics and code benchmarks demonstrate that $\textbf{$\rho$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves comparable performance while substantially improving inference efficiency and token utilization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Darwinian Memory: A Training-Free Self-Regulating Memory System for GUI Agent Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22528</link><description>arXiv:2601.22528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents facilitate Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation but struggle with long-horizon, cross-application tasks due to limited context windows. While memory systems provide a viable solution, existing paradigms struggle to adapt to dynamic GUI environments, suffering from a granularity mismatch between high-level intent and low-level execution, and context pollution where the static accumulation of outdated experiences drives agents into hallucination. To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22528v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SHED Light on Segmentation for Dense Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22529</link><description>arXiv:2601.22529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense prediction infers per-pixel values from a single image and is fundamental to 3D perception and robotics. Although real-world scenes exhibit strong structure, existing methods treat it as an independent pixel-wise prediction, often resulting in structural inconsistencies. We propose SHED, a novel encoder-decoder architecture that enforces geometric prior explicitly by incorporating segmentation into dense prediction. By bidirectional hierarchical reasoning, segment tokens are hierarchically pooled in the encoder and unpooled in the decoder to reverse the hierarchy. The model is supervised only at the final output, allowing the segment hierarchy to emerge without explicit segmentation supervision. SHED improves depth boundary sharpness and segment coherence, while demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization from synthetic to the real-world environments. Its hierarchy-aware decoder better captures global 3D scene layouts, leading to improved semantic segmentation performance. Moreover, SHED enhances 3D reconstruction quality and reveals interpretable part-level structures that are often missed by conventional pixel-wise methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22529v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing TableQA through Verifiable Reasoning Trace Reward</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22530</link><description>arXiv:2601.22530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in training TableQA agents, compared to standard text- and image-based agents, is that answers cannot be inferred from a static input but must be reasoned through stepwise transformations of the table state, introducing multi-step reasoning complexity and environmental interaction. This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer. Consistent improvement pattern across various LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks further confirms RE-Tab's generalisability.

Abstract: Because of the pervasive use of deep neural networks (DNNs), especially in high-stakes domains, the interpretability of DNNs has received increased attention. The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \textbf{REKD} (\textbf{R}ationale \textbf{E}xtraction with \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models. Our experiments across language and vision classification datasets (i.e., IMDB movie reviews, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100) show that REKD significantly improves the predictive performance of the student RE models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22531v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Demystifying Design Choices of Reinforcement Fine-tuning: A Batched Contextual Bandit Learning Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22532</link><description>arXiv:2601.22532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reinforcement fine-tuning area is undergoing an explosion papers largely on optimizing design choices. Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22532v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High Rate Efficient Local List Decoding from HDX</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22535</link><description>arXiv:2601.22535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the first (locally computable, approximately) locally list decodable codes with rate, efficiency, and error tolerance approaching the information theoretic limit, a core regime of interest for the complexity theoretic task of hardness amplification. Our algorithms run in polylogarithmic time and sub-logarithmic depth, which together with classic constructions in the unique decoding (low-noise) regime leads to the resolution of several long-standing problems in coding and complexity theory:
  1. Near-optimally input-preserving hardness amplification (and corresponding fast PRGs)
  2. Constant rate codes with $\log(N)$-depth list decoding (RNC$^1$)
  3. Complexity-preserving distance amplification
  Our codes are built on the powerful theory of (local-spectral) high dimensional expanders (HDX). At a technical level, we make two key contributions. First, we introduce a new framework for ($\mathrm{polylog(N)}$-round) belief propagation on HDX that leverages a mix of local correction and global expansion to control error build-up while maintaining high rate. Second, we introduce the notion of strongly explicit local routing on HDX, local algorithms that given any two target vertices, output a random path between them in only polylogarithmic time (and, preferably, sub-logarithmic depth). Constructing such schemes on certain coset HDX allows us to instantiate our otherwise combinatorial framework in polylogarithmic time and low depth, completing the result.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoding in Geometry: Alleviating Embedding-Space Crowding for Complex Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22536</link><description>arXiv:2601.22536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling-based decoding underlies complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs), where decoding strategies critically shape model behavior. Temperature- and truncation-based methods reshape the next-token distribution through global probability reweighting or thresholding to balance the quality-diversity tradeoff. However, they operate solely on token probabilities, ignoring fine-grained relationships among tokens in the embedding space. We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting. CraEG is training-free, single-pass, and compatible with standard sampling strategies. Experiments on multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate improved generation performance, with gains in robustness and diversity metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22536v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Defer in Non-Stationary Time Series via Switching State-Space Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22538</link><description>arXiv:2601.22538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Learning to Defer for non-stationary time series with partial feedback and time-varying expert availability. At each time step, the router selects an available expert, observes the target, and sees only the queried expert's prediction. We model signed expert residuals using L2D-SLDS, a factorized switching linear-Gaussian state-space model with context-dependent regime transitions, a shared global factor enabling cross-expert information transfer, and per-expert idiosyncratic states. The model supports expert entry and pruning via a dynamic registry. Using one-step-ahead predictive beliefs, we propose an IDS-inspired routing rule that trades off predicted cost against information gained about the latent regime and shared factor. Experiments show improvements over contextual-bandit baselines and a no-shared-factor ablation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22538v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural-Inspired Posterior Approximation (NIPA)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22539</link><description>arXiv:2601.22539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans learn efficiently from their environment by engaging multiple interacting neural systems that support distinct yet complementary forms of control, including model-based (goal-directed) planning, model-free (habitual) responding, and episodic memory-based learning. Model-based mechanisms compute prospective action values using an internal model of the environment, supporting flexible but computationally costly planning; model-free mechanisms cache value estimates and build heuristics that enable fast, efficient habitual responding; and memory-based mechanisms allow rapid adaptation from individual experience. In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples). We show that this approach advances Bayesian methods and facilitates their application to large-scale statistical machine learning problems. In particular, we apply our proposed framework to Bayesian deep learning, with an emphasis on proper and principled uncertainty quantification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22539v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Long Roll-outs of Auto-regressive Neural Operators for the Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Conserved Quantity Correction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22541</link><description>arXiv:2601.22541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has been proposed as an efficient alternative for the numerical approximation of PDE solutions, offering fast, iterative simulation of PDEs through the approximation of solution operators. However, deep learning solutions have struggle to perform well over long prediction durations due to the accumulation of auto-regressive error, which is compounded by the inability of models to conserve physical quantities. In this work, we present conserved quantity correction, a model-agnostic technique for incorporation physical conservation criteria within deep learning models. Our results demonstrate consistent improvement in the long-term stability of auto-regressive neural operator models, regardless of the model architecture. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of neural operators from the spectral domain, highlighting significant limitations of present architectures. These results highlight the need for future work to consider architectures that place specific emphasis on high frequency components, which are integral to the understanding and modeling of turbulent flows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22541v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Detect and Act: Automated Dynamic Optimizer through Meta-Black-Box Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22542</link><description>arXiv:2601.22542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Optimization Problems (DOPs) are challenging to address due to their complex nature, i.e., dynamic environment variation. Evolutionary Computation methods are generally advantaged in solving DOPs since they resemble dynamic biological evolution. However, existing evolutionary dynamic optimization methods rely heavily on human-crafted adaptive strategy to detect environment variation in DOPs, and then adapt the searching strategy accordingly. These hand-crafted strategies may perform ineffectively at out-of-box scenarios. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted approach to enable automated variation detection and self-adaption in evolutionary algorithms. This is achieved by borrowing the bi-level learning-to-optimize idea from recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization works. We use a deep Q-network as optimization dynamics detector and searching strategy adapter: It is fed as input with current-step optimization state and then dictates desired control parameters to underlying evolutionary algorithms for next-step optimization. The learning objective is to maximize the expected performance gain across a problem distribution. Once trained, our approach could generalize toward unseen DOPs with automated environment variation detection and self-adaption. To facilitate comprehensive validation, we further construct an easy-to-difficult DOPs testbed with diverse synthetic instances. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate flexible searching behavior and superior performance of our approach in solving DOPs, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22542v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SCaLRec: Semantic Calibration for LLM-enabled Cloud-Device Sequential Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22543</link><description>arXiv:2601.22543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-device collaborative recommendation partitions computation across the cloud and user devices: the cloud provides semantic user modeling, while the device leverages recent interactions and cloud semantic signals for privacy-preserving, responsive reranking. With large language models (LLMs) on the cloud, semantic user representations can improve sequential recommendation by capturing high-level intent. However, regenerating such representations via cloud LLM inference for every request is often infeasible at real-world scale. As a result, on-device reranking commonly reuses a cached cloud semantic user embedding across requests. We empirically identify a cloud semantic staleness effect: reused embeddings become less aligned with the user's latest interactions, leading to measurable ranking degradation.
  Most existing LLM-enabled cloud-device recommenders are typically designed around on-demand cloud semantics, either by assuming low-latency cloud LLM access or by regenerating semantic embeddings per request. When per-request regeneration is infeasible and cached semantics must be reused, two technical challenges arise: (1) deciding when cached cloud semantics remain useful for on-device reranking, and (2) maintaining ranking quality when the cloud LLM cannot be invoked and only cached semantics are available. To address this gap, we introduce the Semantic Calibration for LLM-enabled Cloud-Device Recommendation (SCaLRec). First, it estimates the reliability of cached semantics under the user's latest interactions. Second, an on-device semantic calibration module is proposed to adjusts the cached semantic embedding on-device using up-to-date interaction evidence, without per-request cloud LLM involvement. Experiments on real-world datasets show that SCaLRec consistently improves recommendation performance over strong baselines under cloud semantic staleness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22543v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adapting Reinforcement Learning for Path Planning in Constrained Parking Scenarios</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22545</link><description>arXiv:2601.22545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time path planning in constrained environments remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous systems. Traditional classical planners, while effective under perfect perception assumptions, are often sensitive to real-world perception constraints and rely on online search procedures that incur high computational costs. In complex surroundings, this renders real-time deployment prohibitive. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for real-time path planning in parking scenarios. In particular, we focus on challenging scenes with tight spaces that require a high number of reversal maneuvers and adjustments. Unlike classical planners, our solution does not require ideal and structured perception, and in principle, could avoid the need for additional modules such as localization and tracking, resulting in a simpler and more practical implementation. Also, at test time, the policy generates actions through a single forward pass at each step, which is lightweight enough for real-time deployment. The task is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem grounded in a bicycle model dynamics, enabling the agent to directly learn navigation policies that respect vehicle kinematics and environmental constraints in the closed-loop setting. A new benchmark is developed to support both training and evaluation, capturing diverse and challenging scenarios. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art success rates and efficiency, surpassing classical planner baselines by +96% in success rate and +52% in efficiency. Furthermore, we release our benchmark as an open-source resource for the community to foster future research in autonomous systems. The benchmark and accompanying tools are available at https://github.com/dqm5rtfg9b-collab/Constrained_Parking_Scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22545v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards the Holographic Characteristic of LLMs for Efficient Short-text Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22546</link><description>arXiv:2601.22546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted interest in exploring their in-context learning abilities and chain-of-thought capabilities. However, there are few studies investigating the specific traits related to the powerful generation capacity of LLMs. This paper aims to delve into the generation characteristics exhibited by LLMs. Through our investigation, we have discovered that language models tend to capture target-side keywords at the beginning of the generation process. We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario. The results demonstrate that HOLO achieves comparable performance to the baselines in terms of both automatic and human-like evaluation metrics and highlight the potential of the Holographic Characteristic.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22546v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PersonaAct: Simulating Short-Video Users with Personalized Agents for Counterfactual Filter Bubble Auditing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22547</link><description>arXiv:2601.22547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-video platforms rely on personalized recommendation, raising concerns about filter bubbles that narrow content exposure. Auditing such phenomena at scale is challenging because real user studies are costly and privacy-sensitive, and existing simulators fail to reproduce realistic behaviors due to their reliance on textual signals and weak personalization. We propose PersonaAct, a framework for simulating short-video users with persona-conditioned multimodal agents trained on real behavioral traces for auditing filter bubbles in breadth and depth. PersonaAct synthesizes interpretable personas through automated interviews combining behavioral analysis with structured questioning, then trains agents on multimodal observations using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We deploy trained agents for filter bubble auditing and evaluate bubble breadth via content diversity and bubble depth via escape potential. The evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in fidelity over generic LLM baselines, enabling realistic behavior reproduction. Results reveal significant content narrowing over interaction. However, we find that Bilibili demonstrates the strongest escape potential. We release the first open multimodal short-video dataset and code to support reproducible auditing of recommender systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22547v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are LLM Evaluators Really Narcissists? Sanity Checking Self-Preference Evaluations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22548</link><description>arXiv:2601.22548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLM) favor own outputs when acting as judges, undermining the integrity of automated post-training and evaluation workflows. However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of "easy" versus "hard" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22548v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exo-Plore: Exploring Exoskeleton Control Space through Human-aligned Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22550</link><description>arXiv:2601.22550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoskeletons show great promise for enhancing mobility, but providing appropriate assistance remains challenging due to the complexity of human adaptation to external forces. Current state-of-the-art approaches for optimizing exoskeleton controllers require extensive human experiments in which participants must walk for hours, creating a paradox: those who could benefit most from exoskeleton assistance, such as individuals with mobility impairments, are rarely able to participate in such demanding procedures.

Abstract: Large-scale formalization projects in Lean rely on blueprints: structured dependency graphs linking informal mathematical exposition to formal declarations. While blueprints are central to human collaboration, existing tooling treats the informal ($\LaTeX$) and formal (Lean) components as largely decoupled artifacts, leading to maintenance overhead and limiting integration with AI automation. We present LeanArchitect, a Lean package for extracting, managing, and exporting blueprint data directly from Lean code. LeanArchitect introduces a declarative annotation mechanism that associates formal declarations with blueprint metadata, automatically infers dependency information, and generates $\LaTeX$ blueprint content synchronized with the Lean development. This design eliminates duplication between formal and informal representations and eases fine-grained progress tracking for both human contributors and AI-based theorem provers. We demonstrate the practicality of LeanArchitect through the automated conversion of several large existing blueprint-driven projects, and through a human--AI collaboration case study formalizing a multivariate Taylor theorem. Our results show that LeanArchitect improves maintainability, exposes latent inconsistencies in existing blueprints, and provides an effective interface for integrating AI tools into real-world formalization workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22554v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VocBulwark: Towards Practical Generative Speech Watermarking via Additional-Parameter Injection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22556</link><description>arXiv:2601.22556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generated speech achieves human-level naturalness but escalates security risks of misuse.

Specifically, we design a Temporal Adapter to deeply entangle watermarks with acoustic attributes, synergizing with a Coarse-to-Fine Gated Extractor to resist advanced attacks. Furthermore, we develop an Accuracy-Guided Optimization Curriculum that dynamically orchestrates gradient flow to resolve the optimization conflict between fidelity and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VocBulwark achieves high-capacity and high-fidelity watermarking, offering robust defense against complex practical scenarios, with resilience to Codec regenerations and variable-length manipulations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22556v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recursive Mutexes in Separation Logic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22557</link><description>arXiv:2601.22557v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: This paper considers the bandit quickest change detection problem in which one stream contains a change-point that shifts its distribution by an unknown amount in an unknown direction. We consider an agent that can observe only a single stream at each time, and the goal of the agent is to detect this change as quickly as possible while controlling for false alarms. We propose an algorithm that combines a decaying-$\epsilon$-greedy stream switching rule with an efficient change-point detection algorithm for unknown post-change means. We provide bounds on the expected detection delay and average run length to false alarm for our algorithm, and based on these results we prove our algorithm is approximately optimal with respect to a commonly used surrogate. This work is the first to provide provable guarantees in this setting without strong assumptions such as a discretized post-change parameter set or a lower bound on the magnitude of change.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22561v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EUGens: Efficient, Unified, and General Dense Layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22563</link><description>arXiv:2601.22563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22563v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum $(r,\delta)$-Locally Recoverable BCH and Homothetic-BCH Codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22567</link><description>arXiv:2601.22567v1 Announce Type: new

In this work, we perform an AI red-teaming evaluation of AP2 and identify vulnerabilities arising from indirect and direct prompt injection. We introduce two attack techniques, the Branded Whisper Attack and the Vault Whisper Attack which manipulate product ranking and extract sensitive user data. Using a functional AP2 based shopping agent built with Gemini-2.5-Flash and the Google ADK framework, we experimentally validate that simple adversarial prompts can reliably subvert agent behavior. Our findings reveal critical weaknesses in current agentic payment architectures and highlight the need for stronger isolation and defensive safeguards in LLM-mediated financial systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22569v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging Data to Say No: Memory Augmented Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22570</link><description>arXiv:2601.22570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective prediction aims to endow predictors with a reject option, to avoid low confidence predictions. However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents has enabled automated task processing through reasoning and tool invocation capabilities. However, existing frameworks often operate under the idealized assumption that tool executions are invariably successful, relying solely on textual descriptions that fail to distinguish precise performance boundaries and cannot adapt to iterative tool updates. This gap introduces uncertainty in planning and execution, particularly in domains like visual content generation (AIGC), where nuanced tool performance significantly impacts outcomes. To address this, we propose PerfGuard, a performance-aware agent framework for visual content generation that systematically models tool performance boundaries and integrates them into task planning and scheduling. Our framework introduces three core mechanisms: (1) Performance-Aware Selection Modeling (PASM), which replaces generic tool descriptions with a multi-dimensional scoring system based on fine-grained performance evaluations; (2) Adaptive Preference Update (APU), which dynamically optimizes tool selection by comparing theoretical rankings with actual execution rankings; and (3) Capability-Aligned Planning Optimization (CAPO), which guides the planner to generate subtasks aligned with performance-aware strategies. Experimental comparisons against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate PerfGuard's advantages in tool selection accuracy, execution reliability, and alignment with user intent, validating its robustness and practical utility for complex AIGC tasks. The project code is available at https://github.com/FelixChan9527/PerfGuard.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22571v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DELNet: Continuous All-in-One Weather Removal via Dynamic Expert Library</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22573</link><description>arXiv:2601.22573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-in-one weather image restoration methods are valuable in practice but depend on pre-collected data and require retraining for unseen degradations, leading to high cost. We propose DELNet, a continual learning framework for weather image restoration. DELNet integrates a judging valve that measures task similarity to distinguish new from known tasks, and a dynamic expert library that stores experts trained on different degradations. For new tasks, the valve selects top-k experts for knowledge transfer while adding new experts to capture task-specific features; for known tasks, the corresponding experts are directly reused. This design enables continuous optimization without retraining existing models. Experiments on OTS, Rain100H, and Snow100K demonstrate that DELNet surpasses state-of-the-art continual learning methods, achieving PSNR gains of 16\%, 11\%, and 12\%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of DELNet, which reduces retraining cost and enables practical deployment in real-world scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22573v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Hallucinations in Video Large Language Models via Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22574</link><description>arXiv:2601.22574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Video Large Language Models perform remarkably well across tasks such as video understanding, question answering, and reasoning, they still suffer from the problem of hallucination, which refers to generating outputs that are inconsistent with explicit video content or factual evidence. However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22574v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PhoStream: Benchmarking Real-World Streaming for Omnimodal Assistants in Mobile Scenarios</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22575</link><description>arXiv:2601.22575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel at offline audio-visual understanding, but their ability to serve as mobile assistants in continuous real-world streams remains underexplored. In daily phone use, mobile assistants must track streaming audio-visual inputs and respond at the right time, yet existing benchmarks are often restricted to multiple-choice questions or use shorter videos. In this paper, we introduce PhoStream, the first mobile-centric streaming benchmark that unifies on-screen and off-screen scenarios to evaluate video, audio, and temporal reasoning. PhoStream contains 5,572 open-ended QA pairs from 578 videos across 4 scenarios and 10 capabilities. We build it with an Automated Generative Pipeline backed by rigorous human verification, and evaluate models using a realistic Online Inference Pipeline and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation for open-ended responses. Experiments reveal a temporal asymmetry in LLM-judged scores (0-100): models perform well on Instant and Backward tasks (Gemini 3 Pro exceeds 80), but drop sharply on Forward tasks (16.40), largely due to early responses before the required visual and audio cues appear. This highlights a fundamental limitation: current MLLMs struggle to decide when to speak, not just what to say.

Abstract: Federated learning offers a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving traffic prediction, yet its performance is often challenged by the non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) nature of decentralized traffic data. Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22578v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Non-Intrusive Graph-Based Bot Detection for E-Commerce Using Inductive Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22579</link><description>arXiv:2601.22579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malicious bots pose a growing threat to e-commerce platforms by scraping data, hoarding inventory, and perpetrating fraud. Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22579v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SpanNorm: Reconciling Training Stability and Performance in Deep Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22580</link><description>arXiv:2601.22580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on the stable training of deep Transformer architectures. A critical design choice is the placement of normalization layers, leading to a fundamental trade-off: the ``PreNorm'' architecture ensures training stability at the cost of potential performance degradation in deep models, while the ``PostNorm'' architecture offers strong performance but suffers from severe training instability. In this work, we propose SpanNorm, a novel technique designed to resolve this dilemma by integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Structurally, SpanNorm establishes a clean residual connection that spans the entire transformer block to stabilize signal propagation, while employing a PostNorm-style computation that normalizes the aggregated output to enhance model performance. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that SpanNorm, combined with a principled scaling strategy, maintains bounded signal variance throughout the network, preventing the gradient issues that plague PostNorm models, and also alleviating the representation collapse of PreNorm. Empirically, SpanNorm consistently outperforms standard normalization schemes in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and stable Transformer architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22580v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Mixup Foundation Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22581</link><description>arXiv:2601.22581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) for hyper-spectral image (HSI) classification has attracted significant research interest, existing works often rely on an unrealistic data augmentation procedure in the form of external noise to enlarge the sample size, thus greatly simplifying the issue of data scarcity. They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin. The source code of MIFOMO is open-sourced in https://github.com/Naeem- Paeedeh/MIFOMO for reproducibility and convenient further study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22581v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MC-GRPO: Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization for Small-Rollout Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22582</link><description>arXiv:2601.22582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group-relative policy optimization methods train language models by generating multiple rollouts per prompt and normalizing rewards with a shared mean reward baseline. In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

Evaluations on a multi-vendor GPU cluster show that HetCCL matches NCCL and RCCL performance in homogeneous setups while uniquely scaling in heterogeneous environments, enabling practical, high-performance training with both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs without changes to existing deep learning applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22585v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WED-Net: A Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network with Causal Augmentation for Urban Flow Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22586</link><description>arXiv:2601.22586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban spatio-temporal prediction under extreme conditions (e.g., heavy rain) is challenging due to event rarity and dynamics. Existing data-driven approaches that incorporate weather as auxiliary input often rely on coarse-grained descriptors and lack dedicated mechanisms to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal effects. Although recent methods adopt causal techniques to improve out-of-distribution generalization, they typically overlook temporal dynamics or depend on fixed confounder stratification. To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions. Additionally, we design a causal data augmentation strategy that perturbs non-causal parts while preserving causal structures, enabling improved generalization under rare scenarios. Experiments on taxi-flow datasets from three cities demonstrate that WED-Net delivers robust performance under extreme weather conditions, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience in real-world settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as reference-free evaluators via prompting, but this "LLM-as-a-Judge" paradigm is costly, opaque, and sensitive to prompt design. In this work, we investigate whether smaller models can serve as efficient evaluators by leveraging internal representations instead of surface generation. We uncover a consistent empirical pattern: small LMs, despite with weak generative ability, encode rich evaluative signals in their hidden states. This motivates us to propose the Semantic Capacity Asymmetry Hypothesis: evaluation requires significantly less semantic capacity than generation and can be grounded in intermediate representations, suggesting that evaluation does not necessarily need to rely on large-scale generative models but can instead leverage latent features from smaller ones. Our findings motivate a paradigm shift from LLM-as-a-Judge to Representation-as-a-Judge, a decoding-free evaluation strategy that probes internal model structure rather than relying on prompted output. We instantiate this paradigm through INSPECTOR, a probing-based framework that predicts aspect-level evaluation scores from small model representations. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, GPQA) show that INSPECTOR substantially outperforms prompting-based small LMs and closely approximates full LLM judges, while offering a more efficient, reliable, and interpretable alternative for scalable evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22588v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FedCARE: Federated Unlearning with Conflict-Aware Projection and Relearning-Resistant Recovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22589</link><description>arXiv:2601.22589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing raw data, but privacy regulations such as the right to be forgotten require FL systems to remove the influence of previously used training data upon request. Retraining a federated model from scratch is prohibitively expensive, motivating federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures under both IID and non-IID settings show that FedCARE achieves effective forgetting, improved utility retention, and reduced relearning risk compared to state of the art FU baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Small is Beautiful: A Practical and Efficient Log Parsing Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22590</link><description>arXiv:2601.22590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Log parsing is a fundamental step in log analysis, partitioning raw logs into constant templates and dynamic variables. While recent semantic-based parsers leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit superior generalizability over traditional syntax-based methods, their effectiveness is heavily contingent on model scale. This dependency leads to significant performance collapse when employing smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. Such degradation creates a major barrier to real-world adoption, where data privacy requirements and computational constraints necessitate the use of succinct models. To bridge this gap, we propose EFParser, an unsupervised LLM-based log parser designed to enhance the capabilities of smaller models through systematic architectural innovation. EFParser introduces a dual-cache system with an adaptive updating mechanism that distinguishes between novel patterns and variations of existing templates. This allows the parser to merge redundant templates and rectify prior errors, maintaining cache consistency. Furthermore, a dedicated correction module acts as a gatekeeper, validating and refining every LLM-generated template before caching to prevent error injection. Empirical evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that EFParser outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 12.5% across all metrics when running on smaller LLMs, even surpassing some baselines utilizing large-scale models. Despite its additional validation steps, EFParser maintains high computational efficiency, offering a robust and practical solution for real-world log analysis deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22590v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Heterogeneous Graph Alignment for Joint Reasoning and Interpretability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22593</link><description>arXiv:2601.22593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-graph learning is crucial for extracting meaningful signals from collections of heterogeneous graphs. However, effectively integrating information across graphs with differing topologies, scales, and semantics, often in the absence of shared node identities, remains a significant challenge. We present the Multi-Graph Meta-Transformer (MGMT), a unified, scalable, and interpretable framework for cross-graph learning. MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries. Our work establishes MGMT as a unified framework for structured multi-graph learning, advancing representation techniques in domains where graph-based data plays a central role.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22593v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language Model Circuits Are Sparse in the Neuron Basis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22594</link><description>arXiv:2601.22594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-level concepts that a neural network uses to perform computation need not be aligned to individual neurons (Smolensky, 1986). Language model interpretability research has thus turned to techniques such as \textit{sparse autoencoders} (SAEs) to decompose the neuron basis into more interpretable units of model computation, for tasks such as \textit{circuit tracing}. However, not all neuron-based representations are uninterpretable. For the first time, we empirically show that \textbf{MLP neurons are as sparse a feature basis as SAEs}. We use this finding to develop an end-to-end pipeline for circuit tracing on the MLP neuron basis, which locates causal circuitry on a variety of tasks using gradient-based attribution. On a standard subject-verb agreement benchmark (Marks et al., 2025), a circuit of $\approx 10^2$ MLP neurons is enough to control model behaviour. On the multi-hop city $\to$ state $\to$ capital task from Lindsey et al., 2025, we find a circuit in which small sets of neurons encode specific latent reasoning steps (e.g.~`map city to its state'), and can be steered to change the model's output. This work thus advances automated interpretability of language models without additional training costs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22594v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learn More with Less: Uncertainty Consistency Guided Query Selection for RLVR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22595</link><description>arXiv:2601.22595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently improved mathematical reasoning through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). However, existing RLVR algorithms require large query budgets, making annotation costly. We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult. Therefore, we introduce a new online variant, computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty. Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance while training on only 30% of the data, effectively reducing the cost of RLVR for reasoning tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22595v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FOTBCD: A Large-Scale Building Change Detection Benchmark from French Orthophotos and Topographic Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22596</link><description>arXiv:2601.22596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce FOTBCD, a large-scale building change detection dataset derived from authoritative French orthophotos and topographic building data provided by IGN France. Unlike existing benchmarks that are geographically constrained to single cities or limited regions, FOTBCD spans 28 departments across mainland France, with 25 used for training and three geographically disjoint departments held out for evaluation. The dataset covers diverse urban, suburban, and rural environments at 0.2m/pixel resolution. We publicly release FOTBCD-Binary, a dataset comprising approximately 28,000 before/after image pairs with pixel-wise binary building change masks, each associated with patch-level spatial metadata. The dataset is designed for large-scale benchmarking and evaluation under geographic domain shift, with validation and test samples drawn from held-out departments and manually verified to ensure label quality. In addition, we publicly release FOTBCD-Instances, a publicly available instance-level annotated subset comprising several thousand image pairs, which illustrates the complete annotation schema used in the full instance-level version of FOTBCD. Using a fixed reference baseline, we benchmark FOTBCD-Binary against LEVIR-CD+ and WHU-CD, providing strong empirical evidence that geographic diversity at the dataset level is associated with improved cross-domain generalization in building change detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22596v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TimeMachine-bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Model Capabilities in Repository-Level Migration Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22597</link><description>arXiv:2601.22597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of automated software engineering, research focus is increasingly shifting toward practical tasks reflecting the day-to-day work of software engineers. Among these tasks, software migration, a critical process of adapting code to evolving environments, has been largely overlooked. In this study, we introduce TimeMachine-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate software migration in real-world Python projects. Our benchmark consists of GitHub repositories whose tests begin to fail in response to dependency updates. The construction process is fully automated, enabling live updates of the benchmark. Furthermore, we curated a human-verified subset to ensure problem solvability. We evaluated agent-based baselines built on top of 11 models, including both strong open-weight and state-of-the-art LLMs on this verified subset. Our results indicated that, while LLMs show some promise for migration tasks, they continue to face substantial reliability challenges, including spurious solutions that exploit low test coverage and unnecessary edits stemming from suboptimal tool-use strategies. Our dataset and implementation are available at https://github.com/tohoku-nlp/timemachine-bench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22597v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Semantically Consistent Dataset for Data-Efficient Query-Based Universal Sound Separation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22599</link><description>arXiv:2601.22599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query-based universal sound separation is fundamental to intelligent auditory systems, aiming to isolate specific sources from mixtures. Despite recent advances, existing methods continue to suffer from residual interference in complex acoustic scenes. This performance limitation stems largely from a data bottleneck: in-the-wild datasets contain weak labels and severe co-occurrence of events. These flaws induce models to learn spurious correlations between background noise and target categories instead of robust acoustic features. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline that eliminates co-occurrence of events by mining high-purity single-event segments from in-the-wild datasets via a semantically consistent synthesis protocol. Utilizing this pipeline, we constructed Hive, a high-quality synthetic dataset comprising 2.4k hours of raw audio. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art model SAM-Audio which was trained on a huge dataset $\sim$500 times larger than Hive, certain open-source models trained on Hive achieve competitive separation accuracy and perceptual quality. Moreover, these models exhibited remarkable zero-shot generalization on out-of-distribution evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight that prioritizing purity of supervised signals enables significant data efficiency, offering a new paradigm for training robust auditory foundation models with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Federated unlearning (FU) aims to erase designated client-level, class-level, or sample-level knowledge from a global model. Existing studies commonly assume that the collaboration ends up with the unlearning operation, overlooking the follow-up situation where the federated training continues over the remaining data.We identify a critical failure mode, termed Knowledge resurfacing, by revealing that continued training can re-activate unlearned knowledge and cause the removed influence to resurface in the global model. To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate &lt;1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22601v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An inertial minimal-deformation-rate framework for shape optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22605</link><description>arXiv:2601.22605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a robust numerical framework for PDE-constrained shape optimization and Willmore-driven surface hole filling. To address two central challenges -- slow progress in flat energy landscapes, which can trigger premature stagnation at suboptimal configurations, and mesh deterioration during geometric evolution -- we couple a second-order inertial flow with a minimal-deformation-rate (MDR) mesh motion strategy. This coupling accelerates convergence while preserving mesh quality and thus avoids remeshing. To further enhance robustness for non-smooth or non-convex initial geometries, we incorporate surface-diffusion regularization within the Barrett-Garcke-N"urnberg (BGN) framework. Moreover, we extend the inertial MDR methodology to Willmore-type surface hole filling, enabling high-order smooth reconstructions even from incompatible initial data. Numerical experiments demonstrate markedly faster convergence to lower original objective values, together with consistently superior mesh preservation throughout the evolution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22605v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Self-Evolving Synthetic Data to Verifiable-Reward RL: Post-Training Multi-turn Interactive Tool-Using Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22607</link><description>arXiv:2601.22607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive tool-using agents must solve real-world tasks via multi-turn interaction with both humans and external environments, requiring dialogue state tracking, multi-step tool execution, while following complex instructions. Post-training such agents is challenging because synthesis for high-quality multi-turn tool-use data is difficult to scale, and reinforcement learning (RL) could face noisy signals caused by user simulation, leading to degraded training efficiency. We propose a unified framework that combines a self-evolving data agent with verifier-based RL. Our system, EigenData, is a hierarchical multi-agent engine that synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues together with executable per-instance checkers, and improves generation reliability via closed-loop self-evolving process that updates prompts and workflow. Building on the synthetic data, we develop an RL recipe that first fine-tunes the user model and then applies GRPO-style training with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering, yielding consistent improvements beyond SFT. Evaluated on tau^2-bench, our best model reaches 73.0% pass^1 on Airline and 98.3% pass^1 on Telecom, matching or exceeding frontier models. Overall, our results suggest a scalable pathway for bootstrapping complex tool-using behaviors without expensive human annotation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22607v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Computing Dominating Sets in Disk Graphs with Centers in Convex Position</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22609</link><description>arXiv:2601.22609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane and a collection of disks centered at these points, the disk graph $G(P)$ has vertex set $P$, with an edge between two vertices if their corresponding disks intersect. We study the dominating set problem in $G(P)$ under the special case where the points of $P$ are in convex position. The problem is NP-hard in general disk graphs. Under the convex position assumption, however, we present the first polynomial-time algorithm for the problem. Specifically, we design an $O(k^2 n \log^2 n)$-time algorithm, where $k$ denotes the size of a minimum dominating set. For the weighted version, in which each disk has an associated weight and the goal is to compute a dominating set of minimum total weight, we obtain an $O(n^5 \log^2 n)$-time algorithm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22609v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Local-Global Multimodal Contrastive Learning for Molecular Property Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22610</link><description>arXiv:2601.22610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction requires integrating complementary information from molecular structure and chemical semantics. In this work, we propose LGM-CL, a local-global multimodal contrastive learning framework that jointly models molecular graphs and textual representations derived from SMILES and chemistry-aware augmented texts. Local functional group information and global molecular topology are captured using AttentiveFP and Graph Transformer encoders, respectively, and aligned through self-supervised contrastive learning. In addition, chemically enriched textual descriptions are contrasted with original SMILES to incorporate physicochemical semantics in a task-agnostic manner. During fine-tuning, molecular fingerprints are further integrated via Dual Cross-attention multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments on MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that LGM-CL achieves consistent and competitive performance across both classification and regression tasks, validating the effectiveness of unified local-global and multimodal representation learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22610v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stabilizing Transformer Training Through Consensus</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22614</link><description>arXiv:2601.22614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard attention-based transformers are known to exhibit instability under learning rate overspecification during training, particularly at high learning rates. While various methods have been proposed to improve resilience to such overspecification by modifying the optimization procedure, fundamental architectural innovations to this end remain underexplored. In this work, we illustrate that the consensus mechanism, a drop-in replacement for attention, stabilizes transformer training across a wider effective range of learning rates. We formulate consensus as a graphical model and provide extensive empirical analysis demonstrating improved stability across learning rate sweeps on text, DNA, and protein modalities. We further propose a hybrid consensus-attention framework that preserves performance while improving stability. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing the properties of consensus.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22614v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TTSA3R: Training-Free Temporal-Spatial Adaptive Persistent State for Streaming 3D Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22615</link><description>arXiv:2601.22615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming recurrent models enable efficient 3D reconstruction by maintaining persistent state representations. However, they suffer from catastrophic memory forgetting over long sequences due to balancing historical information with new observations. Recent methods alleviate this by deriving adaptive signals from attention perspective, but they operate on single dimensions without considering temporal and spatial consistency. To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks. Moreover, our method exhibits only 15% error increase compared to over 200% degradation in baseline models on extended sequences, significantly improving long-term reconstruction stability. Our codes will be available soon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22615v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniGeo: A Unified 3D Indoor Object Detection Framework Integrating Geometry-Aware Learning and Dynamic Channel Gating</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22616</link><description>arXiv:2601.22616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of robotics and augmented reality in real-world applications has driven considerable research interest in 3D object detection based on point clouds. While previous methods address unified training across multiple datasets, they fail to model geometric relationships in sparse point cloud scenes and ignore the feature distribution in significant areas, which ultimately restricts their performance. To deal with this issue, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, called UniGeo, is proposed. To model geometric relations in scenes, we first propose a geometry-aware learning module that establishes a learnable mapping from spatial relationships to feature weights, which enabes explicit geometric feature enhancement. Then, to further enhance point cloud feature representation, we propose a dynamic channel gating mechanism that leverages learnable channel-wise weighting. This mechanism adaptively optimizes features generated by the sparse 3D U-Net network, significantly enhancing key geometric information. Extensive experiments on six different indoor scene datasets clearly validate the superior performance of our method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22616v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EntroCut: Entropy-Guided Adaptive Truncation for Efficient Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Small-scale Large Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22617</link><description>arXiv:2601.22617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks through extended chain-of-thought generation, but their reliance on lengthy intermediate steps incurs substantial computational cost. We find that the entropy of the model's output distribution in early reasoning steps reliably distinguishes correct from incorrect reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose EntroCut, a training-free method that dynamically truncates reasoning by identifying high-confidence states where reasoning can be safely terminated. To comprehensively evaluate the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, we introduce the Efficiency-Performance Ratio (EPR), a unified metric that quantifies relative token savings per unit accuracy loss. Experiments on four benchmarks show that EntroCut reduces token usage by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy sacrifice, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs compared with existing training-free methods. These results demonstrate that entropy-guided dynamic truncation provides a practical approach to mitigate the inefficiency of LRMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22617v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Layer-wise Swapping for Generalizable Multilingual Safety</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22620</link><description>arXiv:2601.22620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), safety risks remain a critical challenge for low-resource languages. Existing safety datasets are predominantly English centric, limiting progress in multilingual safety alignment. As a result, low resource expert models, finetuned on their respective instruction datasets, tend to exhibit higher unsafety rates compared to their high resource counterparts. In this work, we propose a safety aware layer swapping method that transfers safety alignment from an English safety expert to low resource language experts without additional training. To further enhance transfer ability, our method adaptively selects or blends modules based on their degree of specialization. Our approach preserves performance on general language understanding tasks while enhancing safety in the target languages. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the language expert on general benchmarks such as MMMLU, BELEBELE, and MGSM, while producing more aligned and less harmful responses on the MultiJail safety benchmark.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22620v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ethical Risks of Large Language Models in Medical Consultation: An Assessment Based on Reproductive Ethics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22621</link><description>arXiv:2601.22621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in healthcare and medical consultation settings, a growing concern is whether these models can respond to medical inquiries in a manner that is ethically compliant--particularly in accordance with local ethical standards. To address the pressing need for comprehensive research on reliability and safety, this study systematically evaluates LLM performance in answering questions related to reproductive ethics, specifically assessing their alignment with Chinese ethical regulations.
  Methods: We evaluated eight prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude-3.7) on a custom test set of 986 questions (906 subjective, 80 objective) derived from 168 articles within Chinese reproductive ethics regulations. Subjective responses were evaluated using a novel six-dimensional scoring rubric assessing Safety (Normative Compliance, Guidance Safety) and Quality of the Answer (Problem Identification, Citation, Suggestion, Empathy).
  Results: Significant safety issues were prevalent, with risk rates for unsafe or misleading advice reaching 29.91%. A systemic weakness was observed across all models: universally poor performance in citing normative sources and expressing empathy. We also identified instances of anomalous moral reasoning, including logical self-contradictions and responses violating fundamental moral intuitions.
  Conclusions: Current LLMs are unreliable and unsafe for autonomous reproductive ethics counseling. Despite knowledge recall, they exhibit critical deficiencies in safety, logical consistency, and essential humanistic skills. These findings serve as a critical cautionary note against premature deployment, urging future development to prioritize robust reasoning, regulatory justification, and empathy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22621v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SYMPHONY: Synergistic Multi-agent Planning with Heterogeneous Language Model Assembly</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22623</link><description>arXiv:2601.22623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have increasingly focused on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to construct autonomous agents for complex problem-solving tasks. However, existing approaches predominantly employ a single-agent framework to generate search branches and estimate rewards during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning. This single-agent paradigm inherently limits exploration capabilities, often resulting in insufficient diversity among generated branches and suboptimal planning performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Synergistic Multi-agent Planning with Heterogeneous langauge model assembly (SYMPHONY), a novel multi-agent planning framework that integrates a pool of heterogeneous language model-based agents. By leveraging diverse reasoning patterns across agents, SYMPHONY enhances rollout diversity and facilitates more effective exploration. Empirical results across multiple benchmark tasks show that SYMPHONY achieves strong performance even when instantiated with open-source LLMs deployable on consumer-grade hardware. When enhanced with cloud-based LLMs accessible via API, SYMPHONY demonstrates further improvements, outperforming existing state-of-the-art baselines and underscoring the effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-agent coordination in planning tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22623v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Elderly HealthMag: Systematic Building and Calibrating a Tool for Identifying and Evaluating Senior User Digital Health Software</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22627</link><description>arXiv:2601.22627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital health (DH) software is increasingly deployed to populations where many end users live with one or more health conditions. Yet, DH software development teams frequently operate using implicit, incorrect assumptions about these users, resulting in products that under-serve the specific requirements imposed by their age and health conditions. Consequently, while software may meet clinical objectives on paper, it often fails to be inclusive during actual user interaction. To address this, we propose \textbf{\textit{HealthMag}}, a tool inspired by GenderMag designed to help better elicit, model and evaluate requirements for digital health software. We developed HealthMag through systematic mapping and calibration following the InclusiveMag framework. Furthermore, we integrated this with a calibrated version of an existing AgeMag method to create a dual-lens approach: \textbf{\textit{Elderly HealthMag}}, designed to aid requirements, design and evaluation of mHealth software for senior end users. We demonstrate application and utility of Age HealthMag via cognitive walkthroughs in identifying inclusivity biases in current senior user-oriented digital health applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22627v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TTCS: Test-Time Curriculum Synthesis for Self-Evolving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22628</link><description>arXiv:2601.22628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-Time Training offers a promising way to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by adapting the model using only the test questions. However, existing methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems for two reasons: raw test questions are often too difficult to yield high-quality pseudo-labels, and the limited size of test sets makes continuous online updates prone to instability. To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (Diffusion-LMs) introduce an explicit temporal dimension into text generation, yet how this structure can be leveraged to control generation diversity for exploring multiple valid semantic or reasoning paths remains underexplored. In this paper, we show that Diffusion-LMs, like diffusion models in image generation, exhibit a temporal division of labor: early denoising steps largely determine the global semantic structure, while later steps focus on local lexical refinement. Building on this insight, we propose Time-Annealed Perturbation Sampling (TAPS), a training-free inference strategy that encourages semantic branching early in the diffusion process while progressively reducing perturbations to preserve fluency and instruction adherence. TAPS is compatible with both non-autoregressive and semi-autoregressive Diffusion backbones, demonstrated on LLaDA and TraDo in our paper, and consistently improves output diversity across creative writing and reasoning benchmarks without compromising generation quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22629v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LINA: Linear Autoregressive Image Generative Models with Continuous Tokens</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22630</link><description>arXiv:2601.22630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive models with continuous tokens form a promising paradigm for visual generation, especially for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, but they suffer from high computational cost. We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation.
  Our results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models.
  We further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models.
  Based on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions. LINA achieves competitive performance on both class-conditional and T2I benchmarks, obtaining 2.18 FID on ImageNet (about 1.4B parameters) and 0.74 on GenEval (about 1.5B parameters). A single linear attention module reduces FLOPs by about 61 percent compared to softmax attention.

Abstract: The application of data-driven remaining useful life (RUL) prediction has long been constrained by the availability of large amount of degradation data. Mainstream solutions such as domain adaptation and meta-learning still rely on large amounts of historical degradation data from equipment that is identical or similar to the target, which imposes significant limitations in practical applications. This study investigates PEFT-MuTS, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning framework for few-shot RUL prediction, built on cross-domain pre-trained time-series representation models. Contrary to the widely held view that knowledge transfer in RUL prediction can only occur within similar devices, we demonstrate that substantial benefits can be achieved through pre-training process with large-scale cross-domain time series datasets. A independent feature tuning network and a meta-variable-based low rank multivariate fusion mechanism are developed to enable the pre-trained univariate time-series representation backbone model to fully exploit the multivariate relationships in degradation data for downstream RUL prediction task. Additionally, we introduce a zero-initialized regressor that stabilizes the fine-tuning process under few-shot conditions. Experiments on aero-engine and industrial bearing datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve effective RUL prediction even when less than 1\% of samples of target equipment are used. Meanwhile, it substantially outperforms conventional supervised and few-shot approaches while markedly reducing the data required to achieve high predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial parameter redundancy, particularly in Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). Existing pruning methods suffer from two primary limitations. First, reliance on dataset-specific calibration introduces significant data dependency and computational overhead. Second, being predominantly static, they fail to account for the evolving subset of knowledge neurons in LLMs during autoregressive generation as the context evolves. To address this, we introduce DART, i.e., Dynamic Attention-Guided Runtime Tracing), a lightweight, training-free method that performs on-the-fly context-based pruning. DART monitors shifts in attention score distributions to infer context changes, dynamically updating neuron-level masks to retain salient parameters. Across ten benchmarks, DART outperforms prior dynamic baseline, achieving accuracy gains of up to 14.5% on LLAMA-3.1-8B at 70% FFN sparsity. Furthermore, DART achieves up to 3x better ROUGE-L scores with respect to static-masked pruning on summarization tasks, with its performance comparable to the original dense models. We conclusively demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively adapts to diverse semantic contexts, preserves model capabilities across both general and domain-specific tasks while running at less than 10MBs of memory for LLAMA-3.1-8B(16GBs) with 0.1% FLOPs overhead.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into network operations (AIOps) is hindered by two fundamental challenges: the stochastic grounding problem, where LLMs struggle to reliably parse unstructured, vendor-specific CLI output, and the security gap of granting autonomous agents shell access. This paper introduces MCP-Diag, a hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP). We propose a deterministic translation layer that converts raw stdout from canonical utilities (dig, ping, traceroute) into rigorous JSON schemas before AI ingestion. We further introduce a mandatory "Elicitation Loop" that enforces Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) authorization at the protocol level. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates that MCP-Diag achieving 100% entity extraction accuracy with less than 0.9% execution latency overhead and 3.7x increase in context token usage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22633v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What can Computer Vision learn from Ranganathan?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22634</link><description>arXiv:2601.22634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Semantic Gap Problem (SGP) in Computer Vision (CV) arises from the misalignment between visual and lexical semantics leading to flawed CV dataset design and CV benchmarks. This paper proposes that classification principles of S.R. Ranganathan can offer a principled starting point to address SGP and design high-quality CV datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated for safety under single-shot or low-budget adversarial prompting, which underestimates real-world risk. In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure. This work provides a low-cost, scalable methodology for realistic LLM safety assessment. We will release our code and evaluation scripts upon publication to future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22636v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ScholarPeer: A Context-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for Automated Peer Review</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22638</link><description>arXiv:2601.22638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated peer review has evolved from simple text classification to structured feedback generation. However, current state-of-the-art systems still struggle with "surface-level" critiques: they excel at summarizing content but often fail to accurately assess novelty and significance or identify deep methodological flaws because they evaluate papers in a vacuum, lacking the external context a human expert possesses. In this paper, we introduce ScholarPeer, a search-enabled multi-agent framework designed to emulate the cognitive processes of a senior researcher. ScholarPeer employs a dual-stream process of context acquisition and active verification. It dynamically constructs a domain narrative using a historian agent, identifies missing comparisons via a baseline scout, and verifies claims through a multi-aspect Q&amp;amp;A engine, grounding the critique in live web-scale literature. We evaluate ScholarPeer on DeepReview-13K and the results demonstrate that ScholarPeer achieves significant win-rates against state-of-the-art approaches in side-by-side evaluations and reduces the gap to human-level diversity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22638v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pushing the Boundaries of Natural Reasoning: Interleaved Bonus from Formal-Logic Verification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22642</link><description>arXiv:2601.22642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities, yet their stochastic next-token prediction creates logical inconsistencies and reward hacking that formal symbolic systems avoid. To bridge this gap, we introduce a formal logic verification-guided framework that dynamically interleaves formal symbolic verification with the natural language generation process, providing real-time feedback to detect and rectify errors as they occur. Distinguished from previous neuro-symbolic methods limited by passive post-hoc validation, our approach actively penalizes intermediate fallacies during the reasoning chain. We operationalize this framework via a novel two-stage training pipeline that synergizes formal logic verification-guided supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization. Extensive evaluation on six benchmarks spanning mathematical, logical, and general reasoning demonstrates that our 7B and 14B models outperform state-of-the-art baselines by average margins of 10.4% and 14.2%, respectively. These results validate that formal verification can serve as a scalable mechanism to significantly push the performance boundaries of advanced LLM reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22642v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Medical Chatbots: Meddollina and the Rise of Continuous Clinical Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22645</link><description>arXiv:2601.22645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative medical AI now appears fluent and knowledgeable enough to resemble clinical intelligence, encouraging the belief that scaling will make it safe. But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context. Even as benchmark scores rise, generation-centric systems still show behaviours incompatible with clinical deployment: premature closure, unjustified certainty, intent drift, and instability across multi-step decisions.
  We argue these are structural consequences of treating medicine as next-token prediction. We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient.
  We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.
  Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines. These results suggest deployable medical AI will not emerge from scaling alone, motivating a shift toward Continuous Clinical Intelligence, where progress is measured by clinician-aligned behaviour under uncertainty rather than fluency-driven completion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22645v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Test-Time Mixture of World Models for Embodied Agents in Dynamic Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22647</link><description>arXiv:2601.22647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language model (LM)-based embodied agents are increasingly deployed in real-world settings. Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22647v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UCPO: Uncertainty-Aware Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22648</link><description>arXiv:2601.22648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key to building trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) lies in endowing them with inherent uncertainty expression capabilities to mitigate the hallucinations that restrict their high-stakes applications. However, existing RL paradigms such as GRPO often suffer from Advantage Bias due to binary decision spaces and static uncertainty rewards, inducing either excessive conservatism or overconfidence. To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias. Furthermore, a Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment mechanism is introduced to calibrate uncertainty weights in real-time according to model evolution and instance difficulty. Experimental results in mathematical reasoning and general tasks demonstrate that UCPO effectively resolves the reward imbalance, significantly improving the reliability and calibration of the model beyond their knowledge boundaries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22648v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GUDA: Counterfactual Group-wise Training Data Attribution for Diffusion Models via Unlearning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22651</link><description>arXiv:2601.22651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training-data attribution for vision generative models aims to identify which training data influenced a given output. While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22651v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human-Centered Explainability in AI-Enhanced UI Security Interfaces: Designing Trustworthy Copilots for Cybersecurity Analysts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22653</link><description>arXiv:2601.22653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) copilots are increasingly integrated into enterprise cybersecurity platforms to assist analysts in threat detection, triage, and remediation. However, the effectiveness of these systems depends not only on the accuracy of underlying models but also on the degree to which users can understand and trust their outputs. Existing research on algorithmic explainability has largely focused on model internals, while little attention has been given to how explanations should be surfaced in user interfaces for high-stakes decision-making contexts [8], [5], [6]. We present a mixed-methods study of explanation design strategies in AI-driven security dashboards. Through a taxonomy of explanation styles and a controlled user study with security practitioners, we compare natural language rationales, confidence visualizations, counterfactual explanations, and hybrid approaches. Our findings show that explanation style significantly affects user trust calibration, decision accuracy, and cognitive load. We contribute (1) empirical evidence on the usability of explanation interfaces for security copilots, (2) design guidelines for integrating explainability into enterprise UIs, and (3) a framework for aligning explanation strategies with analyst needs in security operations centers (SOCs). This work advances the design of human-centered AI tools in cybersecurity and provides broader implications for explainability in other high-stakes domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22653v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parameter conditioned interpretable U-Net surrogate model for data-driven predictions of convection-diffusion-reaction processes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22654</link><description>arXiv:2601.22654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined numerical and data-driven workflow for efficient prediction of nonlinear, instationary convection-diffusion-reaction dynamics on a two-dimensional phenotypic domain, motivated by macroscopic modeling of cancer cell plasticity. A finite-difference solver, implemented in C++, is developed using second-order spatial discretizations and a step-size controlled Runge-Kutta time integrator. A mesh refinement study confirms the second-order convergence for the spatial discretizations error. Based on simulated input-output pairs and corresponding parameterizations for the diffusion, advection, and reaction mechanisms, we train a parameter-conditioned U-Net surrogate to approximate the fixed-horizon solution map. The surrogate incorporates Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) for parameter conditioning, coordinate encoding to incorporate spatial location information, and residual blocks to enable multiscale representation learning in combination with the U-Nets skip connections. The trained model achieves low prediction error on held-out test data and provides favorable prediction times due to the GPU based parallelization. Generalization is analyzed using a factorial test dataset, separating initial conditions from parameter conditioning. The results reveal that approximation difficulty varies primarily with the conditioning vector (i.e., the induced PDE regime), rather than with the initial conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22654v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Semantic Trap: Do Fine-tuned LLMs Learn Vulnerability Root Cause or Just Functional Pattern?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22655</link><description>arXiv:2601.22655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs demonstrate promising performance in software vulnerability detection after fine-tuning. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect a genuine understanding of vulnerability root causes or merely an exploitation of functional patterns. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed the "semantic trap," where fine-tuned LLMs achieve high detection scores by associating certain functional domains with vulnerability likelihood rather than reasoning about the underlying security semantics.To systematically evaluate this phenomenon, we propose TrapEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to disentangle vulnerability root cause from functional pattern. TrapEval introduces two complementary datasets derived from real-world open-source projects: V2N, which pairs vulnerable code with unrelated benign code, and V2P, which pairs vulnerable code with its corresponding patched version, forcing models to distinguish near-identical code that differs only in subtle security-critical logic. Using TrapEval, we fine-tune five representative state-of-the-art LLMs across three model families and evaluate them under cross-dataset testing, semantic-preserving perturbations, and varying degrees of semantic gap measured by CodeBLEU.Our empirical results reveal that, despite improvements in metrics, fine-tuned LLMs consistently struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from its patched counterpart, exhibit severe robustness degradation under minor semantic-preserving transformations, and rely heavily on functional-context shortcuts when the semantic gap is small. These findings provide strong evidence that current fine-tuning practices often fail to impart true vulnerability reasoning. Our findings serve as a wake-up call: high benchmark scores on traditional datasets may be illusory, masking the model's inability to understand the true causal logic of vulnerabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22655v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NAG: A Unified Native Architecture for Encoder-free Text-Graph Modeling in Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22657</link><description>arXiv:2601.22657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing methods for integrating graphs into Language Models (LMs) typically rely on a segregated architecture: external Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encode structural topology, while LMs process textual semantics. We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22657v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Layerwise Progressive Freezing Enables STE-Free Training of Deep Binary Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22660</link><description>arXiv:2601.22660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate progressive freezing as an alternative to straight-through estimators (STE) for training binary networks from scratch. Under controlled training conditions, we find that while global progressive freezing works for binary-weight networks, it fails for full binary neural networks due to activation-induced gradient blockades. We introduce StoMPP (Stochastic Masked Partial Progressive Binarization), which uses layerwise stochastic masking to progressively replace differentiable clipped weights/activations with hard binary step functions, while only backpropagating through the unfrozen (clipped) subset (i.e., no straight-through estimator). Under a matched minimal training recipe, StoMPP improves accuracy over a BinaryConnect-style STE baseline, with gains that increase with depth (e.g., for ResNet-50 BNN: +18.0 on CIFAR-10, +13.5 on CIFAR-100, and +3.8 on ImageNet; for ResNet-18: +3.1, +4.7, and +1.3). For binary-weight networks, StoMPP achieves 91.2\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 69.5\% on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50. We analyze training dynamics under progressive freezing, revealing non-monotonic convergence and improved depth scaling under binarization constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22660v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating and Rewarding LALMs for Expressive Role-Play TTS via Mean Continuation Log-Probability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22661</link><description>arXiv:2601.22661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have extended Text-to-Speech (TTS) to interactive role-play scenarios, which demand high expressiveness and strict adherence to role-play instructions. However, existing models struggle to maintain stylistic consistency with character profiles and scene descriptions across multi-turn dialogues. A critical bottleneck is the lack of objective metrics for quantifying speaking style. To bridge this gap, we propose Mean Continuation Log-Probability (MCLP) as both an evaluation metric and a reward signal, validated on LALM-based Role-Play TTS (RP-TTS) tasks. Critically, we leverage the In-Context Learning capability of pre-trained LALMs to formulate MCLP via a continuation log-probability prediction. This metric quantifies stylistic consistency by measuring the likelihood of the ground-truth speech conditioned on the generated speech. Furthermore, we employ MCLP as a reinforcement learning reward to enhance the style alignment between generated speech and Role-Play instructions. To facilitate evaluation, we construct an RP-TTS dataset with rich scene and character annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong LALM baselines on both objective and subjective metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22661v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Task-Aware LLM Council with Adaptive Decision Pathways for Decision Support</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22662</link><description>arXiv:2601.22662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse decision-making tasks. However, existing approaches often overlook the specialization differences among available models, treating all LLMs as uniformly applicable regardless of task characteristics. This limits their ability to adapt to varying reasoning demands and task complexities. In this work, we propose Task-Aware LLM Council (TALC), a task-adaptive decision framework that integrates a council of LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable dynamic expert selection and efficient multi-step planning. Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence. Experiments on WebShop, HumanEval, and the Game of 24 demonstrate that TALC achieves superior task success rates and improved search efficiency compared to strong baselines, validating the benefits of specialization-aware routing and adaptive planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22662v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised Synthetic Image Attribution: Alignment and Disentanglement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22663</link><description>arXiv:2601.22663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the quality of synthetic images improves, identifying the underlying concepts of model-generated images is becoming increasingly crucial for copyright protection and ensuring model transparency. Existing methods achieve this attribution goal by training models using annotated pairs of synthetic images and their original training sources. However, obtaining such paired supervision is challenging, as it requires either well-designed synthetic concepts or precise annotations from millions of training sources. To eliminate the need for costly paired annotations, in this paper, we explore the possibility of unsupervised synthetic image attribution. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised method called Alignment and Disentanglement. Specifically, we begin by performing basic concept alignment using contrastive self-supervised learning. Next, we enhance the model's attribution ability by promoting representation disentanglement with the Infomax loss. This approach is motivated by an interesting observation: contrastive self-supervised models, such as MoCo and DINO, inherently exhibit the ability to perform simple cross-domain alignment. By formulating this observation as a theoretical assumption on cross-covariance, we provide a theoretical explanation of how alignment and disentanglement can approximate the concept-matching process through a decomposition of the canonical correlation analysis objective. On the real-world benchmarks, AbC, we show that our unsupervised method surprisingly outperforms the supervised methods. As a starting point, we expect our intuitive insights and experimental findings to provide a fresh perspective on this challenging task.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22663v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time Aligned Reward Model beyond Semantics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22664</link><description>arXiv:2601.22664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it is susceptible to reward overoptimization, in which policy models overfit to the reward model, exploit spurious reward patterns instead of faithfully capturing human intent. Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework. R2M goes beyond vanilla reward models that solely depend on the semantic representations of a pretrained LLM. Instead, it leverages the evolving hidden states of the policy (namely policy feedback) to align with the real-time distribution shift of the policy during the RL process. This work points to a promising new direction for improving the performance of reward models through real-time utilization of feedback from policy models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22664v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ExpAlign: Expectation-Guided Vision-Language Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Grounding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22666</link><description>arXiv:2601.22666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary grounding requires accurate vision-language alignment under weak supervision, yet existing methods either rely on global sentence embeddings that lack fine-grained expressiveness or introduce token-level alignment with explicit supervision or heavy cross-attention designs. We propose ExpAlign, a theoretically grounded vision-language alignment framework built on a principled multiple instance learning formulation. ExpAlign introduces an Expectation Alignment Head that performs attention-based soft MIL pooling over token-region similarities, enabling implicit token and instance selection without additional annotations. To further stabilize alignment learning, we develop an energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization scheme, including a Top-K multi-positive contrastive objective and a Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective derived from a Lagrangian-constrained free-energy minimization. Extensive experiments show that ExpAlign consistently improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, particularly on long-tail categories. Most notably, it achieves 36.2 AP$_r$ on the LVIS minival split, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at comparable model scale, while remaining lightweight and inference-efficient.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22666v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Horizontal Layering to Vertical Integration: A Comparative Study of the AI-Driven Software Development Paradigm</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22667</link><description>arXiv:2601.22667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the organizational implications of Generative AI adoption in software engineering through a multiple-case comparative study. We contrast two development environments: a traditional enterprise (brownfield) and an AI-native startup (greenfield). Our analysis reveals that transitioning from Horizontal Layering (functional specialization) to Vertical Integration (end-to-end ownership) yields 8-fold to 33-fold reductions in resource consumption. We attribute these gains to the emergence of Super Employees, AI-augmented engineers who span traditional role boundaries, and the elimination of inter-functional coordination overhead. Theoretically, we propose Human-AI Collaboration Efficacy as the primary optimization target for engineering organizations, supplanting individual productivity metrics. Our Total Factor Productivity analysis identifies an AI Distortion Effect that diminishes returns to labor scale while amplifying technological leverage.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates decentralized collaborative learning without transmitting raw data. However, reliance on fixed global rounds or validation data for hyperparameter tuning hinders practical deployment by incurring high computational costs and privacy risks. To address this, we propose a data-free early stopping framework that determines the optimal stopping point by monitoring the task vector's growth rate using solely server-side parameters. The numerical results on skin lesion/blood cell classification demonstrate that our approach is comparable to validation-based early stopping across various state-of-the-art FL methods. In particular, the proposed framework spends an average of 47/20 (skin lesion/blood cell) rounds to achieve over 12.5%/10.3% higher performance than early stopping based on validation data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an early stopping framework for FL methods without using any validation data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22669v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Postural Virtual Fixtures for Ergonomic Physical Interactions with Supernumerary Robotic Bodies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22672</link><description>arXiv:2601.22672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjoined collaborative robots, functioning as supernumerary robotic bodies (SRBs), can enhance human load tolerance abilities. However, in tasks involving physical interaction with humans, users may still adopt awkward, non-ergonomic postures, which can lead to discomfort or injury over time. In this paper, we propose a novel control framework that provides kinesthetic feedback to SRB users when a non-ergonomic posture is detected, offering resistance to discourage such behaviors. This approach aims to foster long-term learning of ergonomic habits and promote proper posture during physical interactions. To achieve this, a virtual fixture method is developed, integrated with a continuous, online ergonomic posture assessment framework. Additionally, to improve coordination between the operator and the SRB, which consists of a robotic arm mounted on a floating base, the position of the floating base is adjusted as needed. Experimental results demonstrate the functionality and efficacy of the ergonomics-driven control framework, including two user studies involving practical loco-manipulation tasks with 14 subjects, comparing the proposed framework with a baseline control framework that does not account for human ergonomics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22672v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VisionTrim: Unified Vision Token Compression for Training-Free MLLM Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22674</link><description>arXiv:2601.22674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to excessive visual tokens, particularly in high-resolution and video-based scenarios. Existing token reduction methods typically focus on isolated pipeline components and often neglect textual alignment, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VisionTrim, a unified framework for training-free MLLM acceleration, integrating two effective plug-and-play modules: 1) the Dominant Vision Token Selection (DVTS) module, which preserves essential visual tokens via a global-local view, and 2) the Text-Guided Vision Complement (TGVC) module, which facilitates context-aware token merging guided by textual cues. Extensive experiments across diverse image and video multimodal benchmarks demonstrate the performance superiority of our VisionTrim, advancing practical MLLM deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained traction in vision due to their energy efficiency, bio-plausibility, and inherent temporal processing. Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content. On UCF101, PBO yields over ten percentage points improvement. On more complex multi-modal action recognition and weakly supervised video anomaly detection, PBO delivers consistent and significant gains, offering a new perspective for SNN based video processing and understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22675v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VarParser: Unleashing the Neglected Power of Variables for LLM-based Log Parsing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22676</link><description>arXiv:2601.22676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logs serve as a primary source of information for engineers to diagnose failures in large-scale online service systems. Log parsing, which extracts structured events from massive unstructured log data, is a critical first step for downstream tasks like anomaly detection and failure diagnosis. With advances in large language models (LLMs), leveraging their strong text understanding capabilities has proven effective for accurate log parsing. However, existing LLM-based log parsers all focus on the constant part of logs, ignoring the potential contribution of the variable part to log parsing. This constant-centric strategy brings four key problems. First, inefficient log grouping and sampling with only constant information. Second, a relatively large number of LLM invocations due to constant-based cache, leading to low log parsing accuracy and efficiency. Third, a relatively large number of consumed constant tokens in prompts leads to high LLM invocation costs. At last, these methods only retain placeholders in the results, losing the system visibility brought by variable information in logs.
  Facing these problems, we propose a variable-centric log parsing strategy named VarParser. Through variable contribution sampling, variable-centric parsing cache, and adaptive variable-aware in-context learning, our approach can efficiently capture the variable parts of logs and leverage their contributions to parsing. By introducing variable units, we preserve rich variable information, enhancing the integrity of log parsing results. Extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that VarParser achieves higher accuracy compared to existing methods, significantly improving parsing efficiency while reducing the LLM invocation costs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22676v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Full-Graph vs. Mini-Batch Training: Comprehensive Analysis from a Batch Size and Fan-Out Size Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22678</link><description>arXiv:2601.22678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-graph and mini-batch Graph Neural Network (GNN) training approaches have distinct system design demands, making it crucial to choose the appropriate approach to develop. A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings.

Abstract: Consistency models have been proposed for fast generative modeling, achieving results competitive with diffusion and flow models. However, these methods exhibit inherent instability and limited reproducibility when training from scratch, motivating subsequent work to explain and stabilize these issues. While these efforts have provided valuable insights, the explanations remain fragmented, and the theoretical relationships remain unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization. We further demonstrate that our strategy extends beyond image generation to diffusion-based policy learning, without reliance on a pretrained diffusion model for initialization, thereby illustrating its broader applicability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22679v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Visual Personalization Turing Test</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22680</link><description>arXiv:2601.22680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Visual Personalization Turing Test (VPTT), a new paradigm for evaluating contextual visual personalization based on perceptual indistinguishability, rather than identity replication. A model passes the VPTT if its output (image, video, 3D asset, etc.) is indistinguishable to a human or calibrated VLM judge from content a given person might plausibly create or share. To operationalize VPTT, we present the VPTT Framework, integrating a 10k-persona benchmark (VPTT-Bench), a visual retrieval-augmented generator (VPRAG), and the VPTT Score, a text-only metric calibrated against human and VLM judgments. We show high correlation across human, VLM, and VPTT evaluations, validating the VPTT Score as a reliable perceptual proxy. Experiments demonstrate that VPRAG achieves the best alignment-originality balance, offering a scalable and privacy-safe foundation for personalized generative AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OOVDet: Low-Density Prior Learning for Zero-Shot Out-of-Vocabulary Object Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22685</link><description>arXiv:2601.22685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot out-of-vocabulary detection (ZS-OOVD) aims to accurately recognize objects of in-vocabulary (IV) categories provided at zero-shot inference, while simultaneously rejecting undefined ones (out-of-vocabulary, OOV) that lack corresponding category prompts. However, previous methods are prone to overfitting the IV classes, leading to the OOV or undefined classes being misclassified as IV ones with a high confidence score. To address this issue, this paper proposes a zero-shot OOV detector (OOVDet), a novel framework that effectively detects predefined classes while reliably rejecting undefined ones in zero-shot scenes. Specifically, due to the model's lack of prior knowledge about the distribution of OOV data, we synthesize region-level OOV prompts by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the class-conditional Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, motivated by the assumption that unknown semantics are more likely to emerge in low-density areas of the latent space. For OOV images, we further propose a Dirichlet-based gradient attribution mechanism to mine pseudo-OOV image samples, where the attribution gradients are interpreted as Dirichlet evidence to estimate prediction uncertainty, and samples with high uncertainty are selected as pseudo-OOV images. Building on these synthesized OOV prompts and pseudo-OOV images, we construct the OOV decision boundary through a low-density prior constraint, which regularizes the optimization of OOV classes using Gaussian kernel density estimation in accordance with the above assumption.
  Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenes.

Abstract: Aerial manipulators (AMs) are gaining increasing attention in automated transportation and emergency services due to their superior dexterity compared to conventional multirotor drones. However, their practical deployment is challenged by the complexity of time-varying inertial parameters, which are highly sensitive to payload variations and manipulator configurations. Inspired by human strategies for interacting with unknown objects, this letter presents a novel onboard framework for robust aerial manipulation. The proposed system integrates a vision-based pre-grasp inertia estimation module with a post-grasp adaptation mechanism, enabling real-time estimation and adaptation of inertial dynamics. For control, we develop an inertia-aware adaptive control strategy based on gain scheduling, and assess its robustness via frequency-domain system identification. Our study provides new insights into post-grasp control for AMs, and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22686v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Mathematical Analysis of a Smooth-Convex-Concave Splitting Scheme for the Swift--Hohenberg Equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22687</link><description>arXiv:2601.22687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Swift--Hohenberg equation is a widely studied fourth-order model, originally proposed to describe hydrodynamic fluctuations. It admits an energy-dissipation law and, under suitable assumptions, bounded solutions. Many structure-preserving numerical schemes have been proposed to retain such properties; however, existing approaches are often fully implicit and therefore computationally expensive. We introduce a simple design principle for constructing dissipation-preserving finite difference schemes and apply it to the Swift--Hohenberg equation in three spatial dimensions. Our analysis relies on discrete inequalities for the underlying energy, assuming a Lipschitz continuous gradient and either convexity or $\mu$-strong convexity of the relevant terms. The resulting method is linearly implicit, yet it preserves the original energy-dissipation law, guarantees unique solvability, ensures boundedness of numerical solutions, and admits an a priori error estimate, provided that the time step is sufficiently small. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first linearly implicit finite difference scheme for the Swift--Hohenberg equation for which all of these properties are established.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22687v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TSLM: Tree-Structured Language Modeling for Divergent Thinking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22688</link><description>arXiv:2601.22688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models generate reasoning sequentially, preventing them from decoupling irrelevant exploration paths during search. We introduce Tree-Structured Language Modeling (TSLM), which uses special tokens to encode branching structure, enabling models to generate and selectively expand multiple search paths within a single generation process. By training on complete search trees including both successful and failed attempts, TSLM learns to internalize systematic exploration without redundant recomputation of shared prefixes. TSLM achieves robust performance and superior inference efficiency by avoiding the multiple independent forward passes required by external search methods. These results suggest a new paradigm of inference-time scaling for robust reasoning, demonstrating that supervised learning on complete tree-structured traces provides an efficient alternative for developing systematic exploration capabilities in language models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22688v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Transformers Have the Ability for Periodicity Generalization?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22690</link><description>arXiv:2601.22690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on the Transformer have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks. However, current models still exhibit substantial limitations in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization compared with humans. We investigate this gap through periodicity, one of the basic OOD scenarios. Periodicity captures invariance amid variation. Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation. Experiments reveal that periodicity generalization in Transformers is limited, where models can memorize periodic data during training, but cannot generalize to unseen composite periodicity. We release the source code to support future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22690v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constraint Satisfaction Problems over Finitely Bounded Homogeneous Structures: a Dichotomy between FO and L-hard</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22691</link><description>arXiv:2601.22691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feder-Vardi conjecture, which proposed that every finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is either in P or it is NP-complete, has been solved independently by Bulatov and Zhuk almost ten years ago. Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture which states a similar dichotomy for countably infinite first-order reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures is wide open.
  In this paper, we prove that CSPs over first-order expansions of finitely bounded homogeneous model-complete cores are either first-order definable (and hence in non-uniform AC$^0$) or L-hard under first-order reduction. It is arguably the most general complexity dichotomy when it comes to the scope of structures within Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture. Our strategy is that we first give a new proof of Larose-Tesson theorem, which provides a similar dichotomy over finite structures, and then generalize that new proof to infinite structures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22691v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FNF: Functional Network Fingerprint for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22692</link><description>arXiv:2601.22692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) is costly and has significant commercial value. Consequently, preventing unauthorized appropriation of open-source LLMs and protecting developers' intellectual property rights have become critical challenges. In this work, we propose the Functional Network Fingerprint (FNF), a training-free, sample-efficient method for detecting whether a suspect LLM is derived from a victim model, based on the consistency between their functional network activity. We demonstrate that models that share a common origin, even with differences in scale or architecture, exhibit highly consistent patterns of neuronal activity within their functional networks across diverse input samples. In contrast, models trained independently on distinct data or with different objectives fail to preserve such activity alignment. Unlike conventional approaches, our method requires only a few samples for verification, preserves model utility, and remains robust to common model modifications (such as fine-tuning, pruning, and parameter permutation), as well as to comparisons across diverse architectures and dimensionalities. FNF thus provides model owners and third parties with a simple, non-invasive, and effective tool for protecting LLM intellectual property.

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed 3D human meshes from a single in-the-wild image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing SMPLX-based methods often suffer from slow inference, produce only coarse body poses, and exhibit misalignments or unnatural artifacts in fine-grained regions such as the face and hands. These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent studies on scaling up ranking models have achieved substantial improvement for recommendation systems and search engines. However, most large-scale ranking systems rely on item IDs, where each item is treated as an independent categorical symbol and mapped to a learned embedding. As items rapidly appear and disappear, these embeddings become difficult to train and maintain. This instability impedes effective learning of neural network parameters and limits the scalability of ranking models. In this paper, we show that semantic tokens possess greater scaling potential compared to item IDs. Our proposed framework TRM improves the token generation and application pipeline, leading to 33% reduction in sparse storage while achieving 0.85% AUC increase. Extensive experiments further show that TRM could consistently outperform state-of-the-art models when model capacity scales. Finally, TRM has been successfully deployed on large-scale personalized search engines, yielding 0.26% and 0.75% improvement on user active days and change query ratio respectively through A/B test.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22694v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bi-MCQ: Reformulating Vision-Language Alignment for Negation Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22696</link><description>arXiv:2601.22696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong zero-shot performance via large-scale image-text pretraining and have been widely adopted in medical image analysis. However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference. Experiments on ChestXray14, Open-I, CheXpert, and PadChest show that Bi-MCQ improves negation understanding by up to 0.47 AUC over the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art CARZero model, while achieving up to a 0.08 absolute gain on positive-negative combined (PNC) evaluation. Additionally, Bi-MCQ reduces the affirmative-negative AUC gap by an average of 0.12 compared to InfoNCE-based fine-tuning, demonstrating that objective reformulation can substantially enhance negation understanding in medical VLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22696v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Models Know Models Best: Evaluation via Model-Preferred Formats</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22699</link><description>arXiv:2601.22699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on multiple-choice tasks differs markedly between symbol-based and cloze-style evaluation formats. The observed discrepancies are systematically attributable to task characteristics: natural language continuation benefits from likelihood scoring, whereas explicit comparison is better suited to symbol-based selection. These trends are consistent across various decoder-based LLMs, indicating model-agnostic effects. To address these inconsistencies, a dynamic format-alignment strategy is introduced that employs a lightweight classifier trained on latent model-preference signals. In contrast to human-designed heuristics, which often degrade performance, this approach uses model-generated signals to determine the optimal format for each problem instance. The proposed method achieves substantial and consistent improvements in zero-shot accuracy across reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, better revealing the models' latent capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22699v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Best-of-Q: Improving VLM agents with Q-function Action Ranking at Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22701</link><description>arXiv:2601.22701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become powerful backbones for agents to autonomously operate in digital environments like the web and operating systems. However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining.

Acceptance and effective adoption by clinicians and patients, as well as regulatory approval, require evidence of trustworthiness. A major factor for the development of trustworthy AI is the quantification of data quality for AI model training and testing. We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task. Here, we operationalize this theoretical framework by introducing a collection of data quality metrics - the metric library - for practically measuring data quality dimensions. For each metric, we provide a metric card with the most important information, including definition, applicability, examples, pitfalls and recommendations, to support the understanding and implementation of these metrics. Furthermore, we discuss strategies and provide decision trees for choosing an appropriate set of data quality metrics from the metric library given specific use cases. We demonstrate the impact of our approach exemplarily on the PTB-XL ECG-dataset. This is a first step to enable fit-for-purpose evaluation of training and test data in practice as the base for establishing trustworthy AI in medicine.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22702v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DAVIS: OOD Detection via Dominant Activations and Variance for Increased Separation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22703</link><description>arXiv:2601.22703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is a critical safeguard for deploying machine learning models in the real world. However, most post-hoc detection methods operate on penultimate feature representations derived from global average pooling (GAP) -- a lossy operation that discards valuable distributional statistics from activation maps prior to global average pooling. We contend that these overlooked statistics, particularly channel-wise variance and dominant (maximum) activations, are highly discriminative for OOD detection. We introduce DAVIS, a simple and broadly applicable post-hoc technique that enriches feature vectors by incorporating these crucial statistics, directly addressing the information loss from GAP. Extensive evaluations show DAVIS sets a new benchmark across diverse architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet. It achieves significant reductions in the false positive rate (FPR95), with improvements of 48.26\% on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18, 38.13\% on CIFAR-100 using ResNet-34, and 26.83\% on ImageNet-1k benchmarks using MobileNet-v2. Our analysis reveals the underlying mechanism for this improvement, providing a principled basis for moving beyond the mean in OOD detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22703v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CONCUR: High-Throughput Agentic Batch Inference of LLM via Congestion-Based Concurrency Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22705</link><description>arXiv:2601.22705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch inference for agentic workloads stresses the GPU key-value (KV) cache in a sustained and cumulative manner, often causing severe throughput degradation well before memory capacity is exhausted. We identify this phenomenon as middle-phase thrashing, a previously under-characterized pathology in which cache efficiency collapses as long-lived agents accumulate state over time.
  We argue that mitigating this pathology requires moving beyond reactive, request-level cache management to proactive, agent-level admission control. Drawing inspiration from congestion control in distributed systems, we view the KV cache as a shared resource whose efficient utilization depends on feedback-driven regulation. Based on this insight, we present CONCUR, a lightweight control layer that regulates agent admission to bound aggregate cache pressure while preserving execution continuity. CONCUR adapts a cache-aware control algorithm to dynamically adjust the number of active agents using runtime cache signals.
  Across large models and real-world agent workloads, CONCUR prevents middle-phase thrashing and improves batch inference throughput by up to 4.09x on Qwen3-32B and 1.9x on DeepSeek-V3, while remaining compatible with existing LLM serving systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22705v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RealSec-bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Secure Code Generation in Real-World Repositories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22706</link><description>arXiv:2601.22706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, but their proficiency in producing secure code remains a critical, under-explored area. Existing benchmarks often fall short by relying on synthetic vulnerabilities or evaluating functional correctness in isolation, failing to capture the complex interplay between functionality and security found in real-world software. To address this gap, we introduce RealSec-bench, a new benchmark for secure code generation meticulously constructed from real-world, high-risk Java repositories. Our methodology employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines systematic SAST scanning with CodeQL, LLM-based false positive elimination, and rigorous human expert validation. The resulting benchmark contains 105 instances grounded in real-word repository contexts, spanning 19 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types and exhibiting a wide diversity of data flow complexities, including vulnerabilities with up to 34-hop inter-procedural dependencies. Using RealSec-bench, we conduct an extensive empirical study on 5 popular LLMs. We introduce a novel composite metric, SecurePass@K, to assess both functional correctness and security simultaneously. We find that while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques can improve functional correctness, they provide negligible benefits to security. Furthermore, explicitly prompting models with general security guidelines often leads to compilation failures, harming functional correctness without reliably preventing vulnerabilities. Our work highlights the gap between functional and secure code generation in current LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22706v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Learning-Based Early-Stage IR-Drop Estimation via CNN Surrogate Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22707</link><description>arXiv:2601.22707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IR-drop is a critical power integrity challenge in modern VLSI designs that can cause timing degradation, reliability issues, and functional failures if not detected early in the design flow. Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis. The implementation, dataset generation scripts, and the interactive inference application are publicly available at: https://github.com/riteshbhadana/IR-Drop-Predictor.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a fundamental parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that balances efficiency and performance in large-scale neural networks. However, the proliferation of LoRA variants has led to fragmentation in methodology, theory, code, and evaluation. To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters. Our results uncover several findings, notably: LoRA and its variants exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the choices of learning rate compared to other hyperparameters; moreover, with proper hyperparameter configurations, LoRA consistently matches or surpasses the performance of most of its variants.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22708v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gated Relational Alignment via Confidence-based Distillation for Efficient VLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22709</link><description>arXiv:2601.22709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong multimodal performance but are costly to deploy, and post-training quantization often causes significant accuracy loss. Despite its potential, quantization-aware training for VLMs remains underexplored. We propose GRACE, a framework unifying knowledge distillation and QAT under the Information Bottleneck principle: quantization constrains information capacity while distillation guides what to preserve within this budget. Treating the teacher as a proxy for task-relevant information, we introduce confidence-gated decoupled distillation to filter unreliable supervision, relational centered kernel alignment to transfer visual token structures, and an adaptive controller via Lagrangian relaxation to balance fidelity against capacity constraints. Across extensive benchmarks on LLaVA and Qwen families, our INT4 models consistently outperform FP16 baselines (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B: 70.1 vs. 66.8 on SQA; Qwen2-VL-2B: 76.9 vs. 72.6 on MMBench), nearly matching teacher performance. Using real INT4 kernel, we achieve 3$\times$ throughput with 54% memory reduction. This principled framework significantly outperforms existing quantization methods, making GRACE a compelling solution for resource-constrained deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22709v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AlienLM: Alienization of Language for API-Boundary Privacy in Black-Box LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22710</link><description>arXiv:2601.22710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly accessed via black-box APIs, requiring users to transmit sensitive prompts, outputs, and fine-tuning data to external providers, creating a critical privacy risk at the API boundary. We introduce AlienLM, a deployable API-only privacy layer that protects text by translating it into an Alien Language via a vocabulary-scale bijection, enabling lossless recovery on the client side. Using only standard fine-tuning APIs, Alien Adaptation Training (AAT) adapts target models to operate directly on alienized inputs. Across four LLM backbones and seven benchmarks, AlienLM retains over 81\% of plaintext-oracle performance on average, substantially outperforming random-bijection and character-level baselines. Under adversaries with access to model weights, corpus statistics, and learning-based inverse translation, recovery attacks reconstruct fewer than 0.22\% of alienized tokens. Our results demonstrate a practical pathway for privacy-preserving LLM deployment under API-only access, substantially reducing plaintext exposure while maintaining task performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22710v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SQUAD: Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions via ensemble of early exit neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22711</link><description>arXiv:2601.22711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-exit neural networks have become popular for reducing inference latency by allowing intermediate predictions when sufficient confidence is achieved. However, standard approaches typically rely on single-model confidence thresholds, which are frequently unreliable due to inherent calibration issues. To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22711v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vision-Language Models Unlock Task-Centric Latent Actions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22714</link><description>arXiv:2601.22714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) have rapidly gained traction as an important component in the pre-training pipelines of leading Vision-Language-Action models. However, they fail when observations contain action-correlated distractors, often encoding noise instead of meaningful latent actions. Humans, on the other hand, can effortlessly distinguish task-relevant motions from irrelevant details in any video given only a brief task description. In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones. Finally, we show that simply asking VLMs to ignore distractors can substantially improve latent action quality, yielding up to a six-fold increase in downstream success rates on Distracting MetaWorld.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22714v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking the Blocks: Continuous Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling for Unified LLM Quantization and Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22716</link><description>arXiv:2601.22716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantization methods for LLMs predominantly rely on block-wise structures to maintain efficiency, often at the cost of representational flexibility. In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By "breaking the blocks" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22716v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Step Back: Prefix Importance Ratio Stabilizes Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22718</link><description>arXiv:2601.22718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has increasingly demonstrated strong ability to elicit reasoning behaviors in large language models (LLMs). For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22718v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AEGIS: White-Box Attack Path Generation using LLMs and Training Effectiveness Evaluation for Large-Scale Cyber Defence Exercises</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22720</link><description>arXiv:2601.22720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating attack paths for cyber defence exercises requires substantial expert effort. Existing automation requires vulnerability graphs or exploit sets curated in advance, limiting where it can be applied. We present AEGIS, a system that generates attack paths using LLMs, white-box access, and Monte Carlo Tree Search over real exploit execution. LLM-based search discovers exploits dynamically without pre-existing vulnerability graphs, while white-box access enables validating exploits in isolation before committing to attack paths. Evaluation at CIDeX 2025, a large-scale exercise spanning 46 IT hosts, showed that AEGIS-generated paths are comparable to human-authored scenarios across four dimensions of training experience (perceived learning, engagement, believability, challenge). Results were measured with a validated questionnaire extensible to general simulation-based training. By automating exploit chain discovery and validation, AEGIS reduces scenario development from months to days, shifting expert effort from technical validation to scenario design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22720v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Local Intrinsic Dimension of Representations Predicts Alignment and Generalization in AI Models and Human Brain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22722</link><description>arXiv:2601.22722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has found that neural networks with stronger generalization tend to exhibit higher representational alignment with one another across architectures and training paradigms. In this work, we show that models with stronger generalization also align more strongly with human neural activity. Moreover, generalization performance, model--model alignment, and model--brain alignment are all significantly correlated with each other. We further show that these relationships can be explained by a single geometric property of learned representations: the local intrinsic dimension of embeddings. Lower local dimension is consistently associated with stronger model--model alignment, stronger model--brain alignment, and better generalization, whereas global dimension measures fail to capture these effects. Finally, we find that increasing model capacity and training data scale systematically reduces local intrinsic dimension, providing a geometric account of the benefits of scaling. Together, our results identify local intrinsic dimension as a unifying descriptor of representational convergence in artificial and biological systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22722v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OpenVTON-Bench: A Large-Scale High-Resolution Benchmark for Controllable Virtual Try-On Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22725</link><description>arXiv:2601.22725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly elevated the visual fidelity of Virtual Try-On (VTON) systems, yet reliable evaluation remains a persistent bottleneck. Traditional metrics struggle to quantify fine-grained texture details and semantic consistency, while existing datasets fail to meet commercial standards in scale and diversity. We present OpenVTON-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising approximately 100K high-resolution image pairs (up to $1536 \times 1536$). The dataset is constructed using DINOv3-based hierarchical clustering for semantically balanced sampling and Gemini-powered dense captioning, ensuring a uniform distribution across 20 fine-grained garment categories. To support reliable evaluation, we propose a multi-modal protocol that measures VTON quality along five interpretable dimensions: background consistency, identity fidelity, texture fidelity, shape plausibility, and overall realism. The protocol integrates VLM-based semantic reasoning with a novel Multi-Scale Representation Metric based on SAM3 segmentation and morphological erosion, enabling the separation of boundary alignment errors from internal texture artifacts. Experimental results show strong agreement with human judgments (Kendall's $\tau$ of 0.833 vs. 0.611 for SSIM), establishing a robust benchmark for VTON evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22725v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On Small Pair Decompositions for Point Sets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22728</link><description>arXiv:2601.22728v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a pivotal task in autonomous driving, providing a dense and fine-grained understanding of the surrounding environment, yet single-modality methods face trade-offs between camera semantics and LiDAR geometry. Existing multi-modal frameworks often struggle with modality heterogeneity, spatial misalignment, and the representation crisis--where voxels are computationally heavy and BEV alternatives are lossy. We present GaussianOcc3D, a multi-modal framework bridging camera and LiDAR through a memory-efficient, continuous 3D Gaussian representation. We introduce four modules: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), using depth-wise deformable sampling to lift sparse signals onto Gaussian primitives; (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing (EBFS) to mitigate domain noise; (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion (ACLF) with uncertainty-aware reweighting for sensor reliability; and (4) a Gauss-Mamba Head leveraging Selective State Space Models for global context with linear complexity. Evaluations on Occ3D, SurroundOcc, and SemanticKITTI benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving mIoU scores of 49.4%, 28.9%, and 25.2% respectively.

Abstract: Compressing long chains of thought (CoT) into compact latent tokens is crucial for efficient reasoning with large language models (LLMs). Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the two versions of ImgCoT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22730v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MM-THEBench: Do Reasoning MLLMs Think Reasonably?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22735</link><description>arXiv:2601.22735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mark a shift from non-thinking models to post-trained reasoning models capable of solving complex problems through thinking. However, whether such thinking mitigates hallucinations in multimodal perception and reasoning remains unclear. Self-reflective reasoning enhances robustness but introduces additional hallucinations, and subtle perceptual errors still result in incorrect or coincidentally correct answers. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on models before the emergence of reasoning MLLMs, neglecting the internal thinking process and failing to measure the hallucinations that occur during thinking. To address these challenges, we introduce MM-THEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing hallucinations of intermediate CoTs in reasoning MLLMs. MM-THEBench features a fine-grained taxonomy grounded in cognitive dimensions, diverse data with verified reasoning annotations, and a multi-level automated evaluation framework. Extensive experiments on mainstream reasoning MLLMs reveal insights into how thinking affects hallucination and reasoning capability in various multimodal tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decomposing Epistemic Uncertainty for Causal Decision Making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22736</link><description>arXiv:2601.22736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference from observational data provides strong evidence for the best action in decision-making without performing expensive randomized trials. The effect of an action is usually not identifiable under unobserved confounding, even with an infinite amount of data. Recent work uses neural networks to obtain practical bounds to such causal effects, which is often an intractable problem. However, these approaches may overfit to the dataset and be overconfident in their causal effect estimates. Moreover, there is currently no systematic approach to disentangle how much of the width of causal effect bounds is due to fundamental non-identifiability versus how much is due to finite-sample limitations. We propose a novel framework to address this problem by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set. This allows us to distinguish the part of the interval that can be reduced by collecting more samples, which we call sample uncertainty, from the part that can only be reduced by observing more variables, such as latent confounders or instrumental variables, but not with more data, which we call non-ID uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds to this intersection are obtained by solving min-max and max-min problems with neural causal models by searching over all distributions that the dataset might have been sampled from, and all SCMs that entail the corresponding distribution. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that our algorithm can determine when collecting more samples will not help determine the best action. This can guide practitioners to collect more variables or lean towards a randomized study for best action identification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22736v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lingua-SafetyBench: A Benchmark for Safety Evaluation of Multilingual Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22737</link><description>arXiv:2601.22737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust safety of vision-language large models (VLLMs) under joint multilingual and multimodal inputs remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks are typically multilingual but text-only, or multimodal but monolingual. Recent multilingual multimodal red-teaming efforts render harmful prompts into images, yet rely heavily on typography-style visuals and lack semantically grounded image-text pairs, limiting coverage of realistic cross-modal interactions. We introduce Lingua-SafetyBench, a benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages, explicitly partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets to disentangle risk sources. Evaluating 11 open-source VLLMs reveals a consistent asymmetry: image-dominant risks yield higher ASR in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. A controlled study on the Qwen series shows that scaling and version upgrades reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) overall but disproportionately benefit HRLs, widening the gap between HRLs and Non-HRLs under text-dominant risks. This underscores the necessity of language- and modality-aware safety alignment beyond mere scaling.To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we will publicly release our benchmark, model checkpoints, and source code.The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/zsxr15/Lingua-SafetyBench.Warning: this paper contains examples with unsafe content.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22737v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StreamSense: Streaming Social Task Detection with Selective Vision-Language Model Routing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22738</link><description>arXiv:2601.22738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Live streaming platforms require real-time monitoring and reaction to social signals, utilizing partial and asynchronous evidence from video, text, and audio. We propose StreamSense, a streaming detector that couples a lightweight streaming encoder with selective routing to a Vision-Language Model (VLM) expert. StreamSense handles most timestamps with the lightweight streaming encoder, escalates hard/ambiguous cases to the VLM, and defers decisions when context is insufficient. The encoder is trained using (i) a cross-modal contrastive term to align visual/audio cues with textual signals, and (ii) an IoU-weighted loss that down-weights poorly overlapping target segments, mitigating label interference across segment boundaries. We evaluate StreamSense on multiple social streaming detection tasks (e.g., sentiment classification and hate content moderation), and the results show that StreamSense achieves higher accuracy than VLM-only streaming while only occasionally invoking the VLM, thereby reducing average latency and compute. Our results indicate that selective escalation and deferral are effective primitives for understanding streaming social tasks.

Abstract: Legal judgments may contain errors due to the complexity of case circumstances and the abstract nature of legal concepts, while existing appellate review mechanisms face efficiency pressures from a surge in case volumes. Although current legal AI research focuses on tasks like judgment prediction and legal document generation, the task of judgment review differs fundamentally in its objectives and paradigm: it centers on detecting, classifying, and correcting errors after a judgment is issued, constituting anomaly detection rather than prediction or generation. To address this research gap, we introduce a novel task APPELLATE REVIEW, aiming to assess models' diagnostic reasoning and reliability in legal practice. We also construct a novel dataset benchmark AR-BENCH, which comprises 8,700 finely annotated decisions and 34,617 supplementary corpora. By evaluating 14 large language models, we reveal critical limitations in existing models' ability to identify legal application errors, providing empirical evidence for future improvements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22742v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beauty and the Beast: Imperceptible Perturbations Against Diffusion-Based Face Swapping via Directional Attribute Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22744</link><description>arXiv:2601.22744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based face swapping achieves state-of-the-art performance, yet it also exacerbates the potential harm of malicious face swapping to violate portraiture right or undermine personal reputation. This has spurred the development of proactive defense methods. However, existing approaches face a core trade-off: large perturbations distort facial structures, while small ones weaken protection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose FaceDefense, an enhanced proactive defense framework against diffusion-based face swapping. Our method introduces a new diffusion loss to strengthen the defensive efficacy of adversarial examples, and employs a directional facial attribute editing to restore perturbation-induced distortions, thereby enhancing visual imperceptibility. A two-phase alternating optimization strategy is designed to generate final perturbed face images. Extensive experiments show that FaceDefense significantly outperforms existing methods in both imperceptibility and defense effectiveness, achieving a superior trade-off.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22744v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Is Softmax Loss All You Need?

Abstract: The Softmax loss is one of the most widely employed surrogate objectives for classification and ranking tasks. To elucidate its theoretical properties, the Fenchel-Young framework situates it as a canonical instance within a broad family of surrogates. Concurrently, another line of research has addressed scalability when the number of classes is exceedingly large, in which numerous approximations have been proposed to retain the benefits of the exact objective while improving efficiency. Building on these two perspectives, we present a principled investigation of the Softmax-family losses. We examine whether different surrogates achieve consistency with classification and ranking metrics, and analyze their gradient dynamics to reveal distinct convergence behaviors. We also introduce a systematic bias-variance decomposition for approximate methods that provides convergence guarantees, and further derive a per-epoch complexity analysis, showing explicit trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a representative task demonstrate a strong alignment between consistency, convergence, and empirical performance. Together, these results establish a principled foundation and offer practical guidance for loss selections in large-class machine learning applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22745v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UrbanMoE: A Sparse Multi-Modal Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Multi-Task Urban Region Profiling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22746</link><description>arXiv:2601.22746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban region profiling, the task of characterizing geographical areas, is crucial for urban planning and resource allocation. However, existing research in this domain faces two significant limitations. First, most methods are confined to single-task prediction, failing to capture the interconnected, multi-faceted nature of urban environments where numerous indicators are deeply correlated. Second, the field lacks a standardized experimental benchmark, which severely impedes fair comparison and reproducible progress. To address these challenges, we first establish a comprehensive benchmark for multi-task urban region profiling, featuring multi-modal features and a diverse set of strong baselines to ensure a fair and rigorous evaluation environment. Concurrently, we propose UrbanMoE, the first sparse multi-modal, multi-expert framework specifically architected to solve the multi-task challenge. Leveraging a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, it dynamically routes multi-modal features to specialized sub-networks, enabling the simultaneous prediction of diverse urban indicators. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets within our benchmark, where UrbanMoE consistently demonstrates superior performance over all baselines. Further in-depth analysis validates the efficacy and efficiency of our approach, setting a new state-of-the-art and providing the community with a valuable tool for future research in urban analytics</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22746v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AutoMerge: Search-Based Model Merging Framework for Effective Model Reuse</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22748</link><description>arXiv:2601.22748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software reuse has long been recognized as a critical and widely studied topic in software engineering, offering substantial benefits in reducing development costs, improving software quality, and enhancing operational efficiency. This paradigm extends into deep learning through model reuse. Recently, model merging has emerged in the domain of large language models (LLMs) as a training-free approach that takes multiple task-specific models with the same architecture as source models and merges them without retraining, enhancing model reuse within LLMs. However, no prior work has systematically investigated whether such an approach can be effectively applied to other deep learning models with different architectures across domains. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study that evaluates five model merging techniques on three distinct model architectures across three domains: LLMs, image classification, and autonomous driving. Our findings reveal that directly applying existing model merging techniques leads to highly inconsistent results and falls notably short of their success within LLMs. Moreover, a single model merging technique often fails to handle the heterogeneous structural properties within a model, limiting its applicability to different model architectures across domains. Furthermore, the effectiveness of model merging techniques is highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations, thereby constraining their potential for broader adoption. Inspired by these insights, we propose AutoMerge, a novel search-based model merging framework that first segments complex models into multiple heterogeneous blocks and then systematically explores the merging space to identify the merging technique and its hyperparameter configuration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22748v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Discovering Scaling Exponents with Physics-Informed M\"untz-Sz\'asz Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22751</link><description>arXiv:2601.22751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical systems near singularities, interfaces, and critical points exhibit power-law scaling, yet standard neural networks leave the governing exponents implicit. We introduce physics-informed M"untz-Sz'asz Networks (MSN-PINN), a power-law basis network that treats scaling exponents as trainable parameters. The model outputs both the solution and its scaling structure. We prove identifiability, or unique recovery, and show that, under these conditions, the squared error between learned and true exponents scales as $O(|\mu - \alpha|^2)$. Across experiments, MSN-PINN achieves single-exponent recovery with 1--5% error under noise and sparse sampling. It recovers corner singularity exponents for the two-dimensional Laplace equation with 0.009% error, matches the classical result of Kondrat'ev (1967), and recovers forcing-induced exponents in singular Poisson problems with 0.03% and 0.05% errors. On a 40-configuration wedge benchmark, it reaches a 100% success rate with 0.022% mean error. Constraint-aware training encodes physical requirements such as boundary condition compatibility and improves accuracy by three orders of magnitude over naive training. By combining the expressiveness of neural networks with the interpretability of asymptotic analysis, MSN-PINN produces learned parameters with direct physical meaning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22751v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OSNIP: Breaking the Privacy-Utility-Efficiency Trilemma in LLM Inference via Obfuscated Semantic Null Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22752</link><description>arXiv:2601.22752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Obfuscated Semantic Null space Injection for Privacy (OSNIP), a lightweight client-side encryption framework for privacy-preserving LLM inference. Generalizing the geometric intuition of linear kernels to the high-dimensional latent space of LLMs, we formally define the ``Obfuscated Semantic Null Space'', a high-dimensional regime that preserves semantic fidelity while enforcing near-orthogonality to the original embedding. By injecting perturbations that project the original embedding into this space, OSNIP ensures privacy without any post-processing. Furthermore, OSNIP employs a key-dependent stochastic mapping that synthesizes individualized perturbation trajectories unique to each user. Evaluations on 12 generative and classification benchmarks show that OSNIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, sharply reducing attack success rates while maintaining strong model utility under strict security constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22752v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Procedural Knowledge Extraction from Industrial Troubleshooting Guides Using Vision Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22754</link><description>arXiv:2601.22754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial troubleshooting guides encode diagnostic procedures in flowchart-like diagrams where spatial layout and technical language jointly convey meaning. To integrate this knowledge into operator support systems, which assist shop-floor personnel in diagnosing and resolving equipment issues, the information must first be extracted and structured for machine interpretation. However, when performed manually, this extraction is labor-intensive and error-prone. Vision Language Models offer potential to automate this process by jointly interpreting visual and textual meaning, yet their performance on such guides remains underexplored. This paper evaluates two VLMs on extracting structured knowledge, comparing two prompting strategies: standard instruction-guided versus an augmented approach that cues troubleshooting layout patterns. Results reveal model-specific trade-offs between layout sensitivity and semantic robustness, informing practical deployment decisions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22754v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Generalization from Embedding Dimension and Distributional Convergence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22756</link><description>arXiv:2601.22756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often generalize well despite heavy over-parameterization, challenging classical parameter-based analyses. We study generalization from a representation-centric perspective and analyze how the geometry of learned embeddings controls predictive performance for a fixed trained model. We show that population risk can be bounded by two factors: (i) the intrinsic dimension of the embedding distribution, which determines the convergence rate of empirical embedding distribution to the population distribution in Wasserstein distance, and (ii) the sensitivity of the downstream mapping from embeddings to predictions, characterized by Lipschitz constants. Together, these yield an embedding-dependent error bound that does not rely on parameter counts or hypothesis class complexity. At the final embedding layer, architectural sensitivity vanishes and the bound is dominated by embedding dimension, explaining its strong empirical correlation with generalization performance. Experiments across architectures and datasets validate the theory and demonstrate the utility of embedding-based diagnostics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22756v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling Scaling Behaviors in Molecular Language Models: Effects of Model Size, Data, and Representation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22757</link><description>arXiv:2601.22757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular generative models, often employing GPT-style language modeling on molecular string representations, have shown promising capabilities when scaled to large datasets and model sizes. However, it remains unclear and subject to debate whether these models adhere to predictable scaling laws under fixed computational budgets, which is a crucial understanding for optimally allocating resources between model size, data volume, and molecular representation. In this study, we systematically investigate the scaling behavior of molecular language models across both pretraining and downstream tasks. We train 300 models and conduct over 10,000 experiments, rigorously controlling compute budgets while independently varying model size, number of training tokens, and molecular representation. Our results demonstrate clear scaling laws in molecular models for both pretraining and downstream transfer, reveal the substantial impact of molecular representation on performance, and explain previously observed inconsistencies in scaling behavior for molecular generation. Additionally, we publicly release the largest library of molecular language models to date to facilitate future research and development.

Abstract: Large language model agents often fail to accumulate knowledge from experience, treating each task as an independent challenge. Recent methods extract experience as flattened textual knowledge, which cannot capture procedural logic of complex subtasks. They also lack maintenance mechanisms, causing repository degradation as experience accumulates. We introduce AutoRefine, a framework that extracts and maintains dual-form Experience Patterns from agent execution histories. For procedural subtasks, we extract specialized subagents with independent reasoning and memory. For static knowledge, we extract skill patterns as guidelines or code snippets. A continuous maintenance mechanism scores, prunes, and merges patterns to prevent repository degradation. Evaluated on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and TravelPlanner, AutoRefine achieves 98.4%, 70.4%, and 27.1% respectively, with 20-73% step reductions. On TravelPlanner, automatic extraction exceeds manually designed systems (27.1% vs 12.1%), demonstrating its ability to capture procedural coordination.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22758v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Qualitative Evaluation of LLM-Designed GUI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22759</link><description>arXiv:2601.22759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for automated graphical user interface (GUI) design. This study investigates the usability and adaptability of LLM-generated interfaces by analysing their ability to meet diverse user needs. The experiments included utilization of three state-of-the-art models from January 2025 (OpenAI GPT o3-mini-high, DeepSeek R1, and Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet) generating mockups for three interface types: a chat system, a technical team panel, and a manager dashboard. Expert evaluations revealed that while LLMs are effective at creating structured layouts, they face challenges in meeting accessibility standards and providing interactive functionality. Further testing showed that LLMs could partially tailor interfaces for different user personas but lacked deeper contextual understanding. The results suggest that while LLMs are promising tools for early-stage UI prototyping, human intervention remains critical to ensure usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22759v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AscendCraft: Automatic Ascend NPU Kernel Generation via DSL-Guided Transcompilation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22760</link><description>arXiv:2601.22760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of deep learning models critically depends on efficient kernel implementations, yet developing high-performance kernels for specialized accelerators remains time-consuming and expertise-intensive. While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can generate correct and performant GPU kernels, kernel generation for neural processing units (NPUs) remains largely underexplored due to domain-specific programming models, limited public examples, and sparse documentation. Consequently, directly generating AscendC kernels with LLMs yields extremely low correctness, highlighting a substantial gap between GPU and NPU kernel generation.
  We present AscendCraft, a DSL-guided approach for automatic AscendC kernel generation. AscendCraft introduces a lightweight DSL that abstracts non-essential complexity while explicitly modeling Ascend-specific execution semantics. Kernels are first generated in the DSL using category-specific expert examples and then transcompiled into AscendC through structured, constraint-driven LLM lowering passes. Evaluated on MultiKernelBench across seven operator categories, AscendCraft achieves 98.1% compilation success and 90.4% functional correctness. Moreover, 46.2% of generated kernels match or exceed PyTorch eager execution performance, demonstrating that DSL-guided transcompilation can enable LLMs to generate both correct and competitive NPU kernels. Beyond benchmarks, AscendCraft further demonstrates its generality by successfully generating two correct kernels for newly proposed mHC architecture, achieving performance that substantially surpasses PyTorch eager execution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22760v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Numerical Differentiation of Functions of Two Variables Using Chebyshev Polynomials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22762</link><description>arXiv:2601.22762v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Recent work has revealed a link between self-attention mechanisms in transformers and test-time kernel regression via the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, with standard softmax attention corresponding to a Gaussian kernel. However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $\alpha$-entmax attention with $\alpha = 1 + \frac{1}{n}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \to \infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22766v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Abstract Compliance: Operationalising trust in AI as a moral relationship</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22769</link><description>arXiv:2601.22769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dominant approaches, e.g. the EU's "Trustworthy AI framework", treat trust as a property that can be designed for, evaluated, and governed according to normative and technical criteria. They do not address how trust is subjectively cultivated and experienced, culturally embedded, and inherently relational. This paper proposes some expanded principles for trust in AI that can be incorporated into common development methods and frame trust as a dynamic, temporal relationship, which involves transparency and mutual respect. We draw on relational ethics and, in particular, African communitarian philosophies, to foreground the nuances of inclusive, participatory processes and long-term relationships with communities. Involving communities throughout the AI lifecycle can foster meaningful relationships with AI design and development teams that incrementally build trust and promote more equitable and context-sensitive AI systems. We illustrate how trust-enabling principles based on African relational ethics can be operationalised, using two use-cases for AI: healthcare and education.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22769v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Okara: Detection and Attribution of TLS Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerabilities in Android Apps with Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22770</link><description>arXiv:2601.22770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport Layer Security (TLS) is fundamental to secure online communication, yet vulnerabilities in certificate validation that enable Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks remain a pervasive threat in Android apps. Existing detection tools are hampered by low-coverage UI interaction, costly instrumentation, and a lack of scalable root-cause analysis. We present Okara, a framework that leverages foundation models to automate the detection and deep attribution of TLS MitM Vulnerabilities (TMVs). Okara's detection component, TMV-Hunter, employs foundation model-driven GUI agents to achieve high-coverage app interaction, enabling efficient vulnerability discovery at scale. Deploying TMV-Hunter on 37,349 apps from Google Play and a third-party store revealed 8,374 (22.42%) vulnerable apps. Our measurement shows these vulnerabilities are widespread across all popularity levels, affect critical functionalities like authentication and code delivery, and are highly persistent with a median vulnerable lifespan of over 1,300 days. Okara's attribution component, TMV-ORCA, combines dynamic instrumentation with a novel LLM-based classifier to locate and categorize vulnerable code according to a comprehensive new taxonomy. This analysis attributes 41% of vulnerabilities to third-party libraries and identifies recurring insecure patterns, such as empty trust managers and flawed hostname verification. We have initiated a large-scale responsible disclosure effort and will release our tools and datasets to support further research and mitigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22770v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rust and Go directed fuzzing with LibAFL-DiFuzz</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22772</link><description>arXiv:2601.22772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern SSDLC, program analysis and automated testing are essential for minimizing vulnerabilities before software release, with fuzzing being a fast and widely used dynamic testing method. However, traditional coverage-guided fuzzing may be less effective in specific tasks like verifying static analysis reports or reproducing crashes, while directed fuzzing, focusing on targeted program locations using proximity metrics, proves to be more effective. Some of the earliest directed fuzzers are, for example, AFLGo and BEACON, which use different proximity metric approaches. Although most automated testing tools focus on C/C++ code, the growing popularity of Rust and Go causes the need for precise and efficient testing solutions for these languages. This work expands the applicability of directed fuzzing beyond traditional analysis of C/C++ software. We present a novel approach to directed greybox fuzzing tailored specifically for Rust and Go applications. We introduce advanced preprocessing techniques, rustc compiler customizations, and elaborate graph construction and instrumentation methods to enable effective targeting of specific program locations. Our implemented fuzzing tools, based on LibAFL-DiFuzz backend, demonstrate competitive advantages compared to popular existing fuzzers like afl.rs, cargo-fuzz, and go-fuzz. According to TTE (Time to Exposure) experiments, Rust-LibAFL-DiFuzz outperforms other tools by the best TTE result. Some stability issues can be explained by different mutation approaches. Go-LibAFL-DiFuzz outperforms its opponent by the best and, in the majority of cases, by average result, having two cases with orders of magnitude difference. These results prove better efficiency and accuracy of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22772v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constructing Safety Cases for AI Systems: A Reusable Template Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22773</link><description>arXiv:2601.22773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety cases, structured arguments that a system is acceptably safe, are becoming central to the governance of AI systems. Yet, traditional safety-case practices from aviation or nuclear engineering rely on well-specified system boundaries, stable architectures, and known failure modes. Modern AI systems such as generative and agentic AI are the opposite. Their capabilities emerge unpredictably from low-level training objectives, their behaviour varies with prompts, and their risk profiles shift through fine-tuning, scaffolding, or deployment context. This study examines how safety cases are currently constructed for AI systems and why classical approaches fail to capture these dynamics. It then proposes a framework of reusable safety-case templates, each following a predefined structure of claims, arguments, and evidence tailored for AI systems. The framework introduces comprehensive taxonomies for AI-specific claim types (assertion-based, constrained-based, capability-based), argument types (demonstrative, comparative, causal/explanatory, risk-based, and normative), and evidence families (empirical, mechanistic, comparative, expert-driven, formal methods, operational/field data, and model-based). Each template is illustrated through end-to-end patterns addressing distinctive challenges such as evaluation without ground truth, dynamic model updates, and threshold-based risk decisions. The result is a systematic, composable, and reusable approach to constructing and maintaining safety cases that are credible, auditable, and adaptive to the evolving behaviour of generative and frontier AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22773v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TSPO: Breaking the Double Homogenization Dilemma in Multi-turn Search Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22776</link><description>arXiv:2601.22776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks through iterative information retrieval. However, current reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for search-augmented reasoning predominantly rely on sparse outcome-level rewards, leading to a "Double Homogenization Dilemma." This manifests as (1) Process homogenization, where the thinking, reasoning, and tooling involved in generation are ignored. (2) Intra-group homogenization, coarse-grained outcome rewards often lead to inefficiencies in intra-group advantage estimation with methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during sampling. To address this, we propose Turn-level Stage-aware Policy Optimization (TSPO). TSPO introduces the First-Occurrence Latent Reward (FOLR) mechanism, allocating partial rewards to the step where the ground-truth answer first appears, thereby preserving process-level signals and increasing reward variance within groups without requiring external reward models or any annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average performance gains of 24% and 13.6% on Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22776v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RASST: Fast Cross-modal Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22777</link><description>arXiv:2601.22777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation (SST) produces target text incrementally from partial speech input. Recent speech large language models (Speech LLMs) have substantially improved SST quality, yet they still struggle to correctly translate rare and domain-specific terminology. While retrieval augmentation has been effective for terminology translation in machine translation, bringing retrieval to SST is non-trivial: it requires fast and accurate cross-modal (speech-to-text) retrieval under partial, continually arriving input, and the model must decide whether and when to apply retrieved terms during incremental generation. We propose Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation (RASST), which tightly integrates cross-modal retrieval into the SST pipeline. RASST trains a lightweight speech-text retriever and performs efficient sliding-window retrieval, providing chunkwise terminology hints to the Speech LLM. We further synthesize training data that teaches the Speech LLM to leverage retrieved terms precisely. Experiments on three language directions of the ACL 60/60 dev set show that RASST improves terminology translation accuracy by up to 16% and increases overall translation quality by up to 3 BLEU points, with ablations confirming the contribution of each component.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22777v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Color Matters: Demosaicing-Guided Color Correlation Training for Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22778</link><description>arXiv:2601.22778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As realistic AI-generated images threaten digital authenticity, we address the generalization failure of generative artifact-based detectors by exploiting the intrinsic properties of the camera imaging pipeline. Concretely, we investigate color correlations induced by the color filter array (CFA) and demosaicing, and propose a Demosaicing-guided Color Correlation Training (DCCT) framework for AI-generated image detection. By simulating the CFA sampling pattern, we decompose each color image into a single-channel input (as the condition) and the remaining two channels as the ground-truth targets (for prediction). A self-supervised U-Net is trained to model the conditional distribution of the missing channels from the given one, parameterized via a mixture of logistic functions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DCCT targets a provable distributional difference in color-correlation features between photographic and AI-generated images. By leveraging these distinct features to construct a binary classifier, DCCT achieves state-of-the-art generalization and robustness, significantly outperforming prior methods across over 20 unseen generators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22778v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning with Challenges: Adaptive Difficulty-Aware Data Generation for Mobile GUI Agent Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22781</link><description>arXiv:2601.22781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale, high-quality interaction trajectories are essential for advancing mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This fundamentally restricts learning effectiveness due to the mismatch between the training difficulty and the agent's capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions. Extensive experiments show that MobileGen consistently outperforms existing data generation methods by improving the average performance of GUI agents by 1.57 times across multiple challenging benchmarks. This highlights the importance of capability-aligned data generation for effective mobile GUI agent training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22781v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Compact Hypercube Embeddings for Fast Text-based Wildlife Observation Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22783</link><description>arXiv:2601.22783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale biodiversity monitoring platforms increasingly rely on multimodal wildlife observations. While recent foundation models enable rich semantic representations across vision, audio, and language, retrieving relevant observations from massive archives remains challenging due to the computational cost of high-dimensional similarity search. In this work, we introduce compact hypercube embeddings for fast text-based wildlife observation retrieval, a framework that enables efficient text-based search over large-scale wildlife image and audio databases using compact binary representations. Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost. Moreover, we observe that the hashing objective consistently improves the underlying encoder representations, leading to stronger retrieval and zero-shot generalization. These results demonstrate that binary, language-based retrieval enables scalable and efficient search over large wildlife archives for biodiversity monitoring systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22783v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward IIT-Inspired Consciousness in LLMs: A Reward-Based Learning Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22786</link><description>arXiv:2601.22786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a central goal in language model development, in which consciousness-like processing could serve as a key facilitator. While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

Abstract: Post-training compression is currently divided into two contrasting regimes. On the one hand, fast, data-free, and model-agnostic methods (e.g., NF4 or HQQ) offer maximum accessibility but suffer from functional collapse at extreme bit-rates below 4 bits. On the other hand, techniques leveraging calibration data or extensive recovery training achieve superior fidelity but impose high computational constraints and face uncertain robustness under data distribution shifts. We introduce EntQuant, the first framework to unite the advantages of these distinct paradigms. By matching the performance of data-dependent methods with the speed and universality of data-free techniques, EntQuant enables practical utility in the extreme compression regime. Our method decouples numerical precision from storage cost via entropy coding, compressing a 70B parameter model in less than 30 minutes. We demonstrate that EntQuant does not only achieve state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation sets and models, but also retains functional performance on more complex benchmarks with instruction-tuned models, all at modest inference overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22787v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FACET: Multi-Agent AI Supporting Teachers in Scaling Differentiated Learning for Diverse Students</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22788</link><description>arXiv:2601.22788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classrooms are becoming increasingly heterogeneous, comprising learners with diverse performance and motivation levels, language proficiencies, and learning differences such as dyslexia and ADHD. While teachers recognize the need for differentiated instruction, growing workloads create substantial barriers, making differentiated instruction an ideal that is often unrealized in practice. Current AI educational tools, which promise differentiated materials, are predominantly student-facing and performance-centric, ignoring other aspects that shape learning outcomes. We introduce FACET, a teacher-facing multi-agent framework designed to address these gaps by supporting differentiation that accounts for motivation, performance, and learning differences. Developed with educational stakeholders from the outset, the framework coordinates four specialized agents, including learner simulation, diagnostic assessment, material generation, and evaluation within a teacher-in-the-loop design. School principals (N = 30) shaped system requirements through participatory workshops, while in-service K-12 teachers (N = 70) evaluated material quality. Mixed-methods evaluation demonstrates strong perceived value for inclusive differentiation. Practitioners emphasized both the urgent need arising from classroom heterogeneity and the importance of maintaining pedagogical autonomy as a prerequisite for adoption. We discuss implications for future school deployment and outline partnerships for longitudinal classroom implementation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22788v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conditional Performance Guarantee for Large Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22790</link><description>arXiv:2601.22790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models have shown strong performance through extended chain-of-thought reasoning, yet their computational cost remains significant. Probably approximately correct (PAC) reasoning provides statistical guarantees for efficient reasoning by adaptively switching between thinking and non-thinking models, but the guarantee holds only in the marginal case and does not provide exact conditional coverage. We propose G-PAC reasoning, a practical framework that provides PAC-style guarantees at the group level by partitioning the input space. We develop two instantiations: Group PAC (G-PAC) reasoning for known group structures and Clustered PAC (C-PAC) reasoning for unknown groupings. We prove that both G-PAC and C-PAC achieve group-conditional risk control, and that grouping can strictly improve efficiency over marginal PAC reasoning in heterogeneous settings. Our experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that G-PAC and C-PAC successfully achieve group-conditional risk control while maintaining substantial computational savings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22790v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding on the Edge: LLM-generated Boundary Test Explanations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22791</link><description>arXiv:2601.22791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary value analysis and testing (BVT) is fundamental in software quality assurance because faults tend to cluster at input extremes, yet testers often struggle to understand and justify why certain input-output pairs represent meaningful behavioral boundaries. Large Language Models (LLMs) could help by producing natural-language rationales, but their value for BVT has not been empirically assessed. We therefore conducted an exploratory study on LLM-generated boundary explanations: in a survey, twenty-seven software professionals rated GPT-4.1 explanations for twenty boundary pairs on clarity, correctness, completeness and perceived usefulness, and six of them elaborated in follow-up interviews. Overall, 63.5% of all ratings were positive (4-5 on a five-point Likert scale) compared to 17% negative (1-2), indicating general agreement but also variability in perceptions. Participants favored explanations that followed a clear structure, cited authoritative sources, and adapted their depth to the reader's expertise; they also stressed the need for actionable examples to support debugging and documentation. From these insights, we distilled a seven-item requirement checklist that defines concrete design criteria for future LLM-based boundary explanation tools. The results suggest that, with further refinement, LLM-based tools can support testing workflows by making boundary explanations more actionable and trustworthy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22791v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparse or Dense? A Mechanistic Estimation of Computation Density in Transformer-based LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22795</link><description>arXiv:2601.22795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are comprised of billions of parameters arranged in deep and wide computational graphs. Several studies on LLM efficiency optimization argue that it is possible to prune a significant portion of the parameters, while only marginally impacting performance. This suggests that the computation is not uniformly distributed across the parameters. We introduce here a technique to systematically quantify computation density in LLMs. In particular, we design a density estimator drawing on mechanistic interpretability. We experimentally test our estimator and find that: (1) contrary to what has been often assumed, LLM processing generally involves dense computation; (2) computation density is dynamic, in the sense that models shift between sparse and dense processing regimes depending on the input; (3) per-input density is significantly correlated across LLMs, suggesting that the same inputs trigger either low or high density. Investigating the factors influencing density, we observe that predicting rarer tokens requires higher density, and increasing context length often decreases the density. We believe that our computation density estimator will contribute to a better understanding of the processing at work in LLMs, challenging their symbolic interpretation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22795v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HeatMat: Simulation of City Material Impact on Urban Heat Island Effect</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22796</link><description>arXiv:2601.22796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, defined as a significant increase in temperature in urban environments compared to surrounding areas, is difficult to study in real cities using sensor data (satellites or in-situ stations) due to their coarse spatial and temporal resolution. Among the factors contributing to this effect are the properties of urban materials, which differ from those in rural areas. To analyze their individual impact and to test new material configurations, a high-resolution simulation at the city scale is required. Estimating the current materials used in a city, including those on building facades, is also challenging. We propose HeatMat, an approach to analyze at high resolution the individual impact of urban materials on the UHI effect in a real city, relying only on open data. We estimate building materials using street-view images and a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to supplement existing OpenStreetMap data, which describes the 2D geometry and features of buildings. We further encode this information into a set of 2D maps that represent the city's vertical structure and material characteristics. These maps serve as inputs for our 2.5D simulator, which models coupled heat transfers and enables random-access surface temperature estimation at multiple resolutions, reaching an x20 speedup compared to an equivalent simulation in 3D.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22796v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trackly: A Unified SaaS Platform for User Behavior Analytics and Real Time Rule Based Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22800</link><description>arXiv:2601.22800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding user behavior is essential for improving digital experiences, optimizing business conversions, and mitigating threats like account takeovers, fraud, and bot attacks. Most platforms separate product analytics and security, creating fragmented visibility and delayed threat detection. Trackly, a scalable SaaS platform, unifies comprehensive user behavior analytics with real time, rule based anomaly detection. It tracks sessions, IP based geo location, device browser fingerprints, and granular events such as page views, add to cart, and checkouts. Suspicious activities logins from new devices or locations, impossible travel (Haversine formula), rapid bot like actions, VPN proxy usage, or multiple accounts per IP are flagged via configurable rules with weighted risk scoring, enabling transparent, explainable decisions. A real time dashboard provides global session maps, DAU MAU, bounce rates, and session durations. Integration is simplified with a lightweight JavaScript SDK and secure REST APIs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become central to post-training large language models, yet dominant algorithms rely on clipping mechanisms that introduce optimization issues at scale, including zero-gradient regions, reward hacking, and training instability. We propose Clipping-Free Policy Optimization (CFPO), which replaces heuristic clipping with a convex quadratic penalty derived from Total Variation divergence constraints, yielding an everywhere-differentiable objective that enforces stable policy updates without hard boundaries. We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance. CFPO requires only a one-line code change and no additional hyperparameters. Our results suggest that CFPO is a promising drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for LLM post-training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22801v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CVeDRL: An Efficient Code Verifier via Difficulty-aware Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22803</link><description>arXiv:2601.22803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code verifiers play a critical role in post-verification for LLM-based code generation, yet existing supervised fine-tuning methods suffer from data scarcity, high failure rates, and poor inference efficiency. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by optimizing models through execution-driven rewards without labeled supervision, our preliminary results show that naive RL with only functionality rewards fails to generate effective unit tests for difficult branches and samples. We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics. With this formulation, CVeDRL achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.6B parameters, yielding up to 28.97% higher pass rate and 15.08% higher branch coverage than GPT-3.5, while delivering over $20\times$ faster inference than competitive baselines.

Abstract: Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is the most essential component for polynomial multiplications used in lattice-based Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms such as Kyber, Dilithium, NTRU etc. However, side-channel attacks (SCA) and hardware vulnerabilities in the form of hardware Trojans may alter control signals to disrupt the circuit's control flow and introduce unconventional delays in the critical hardware of PQC. Hardware Trojans, especially on control signals, are more low cost and impactful than data signals because a single corrupted control signal can disrupt or bypass entire computation sequences, whereas data faults usually cause only localized errors. On the other hand, adversaries can perform Soft Analytical Side Channel Attacks (SASCA) on the design using the inserted hardware Trojan. In this paper, we present a secure NTT architecture capable of detecting unconventional delays, control-flow disruptions, and SASCA, while providing an adaptive fault-correction methodology for their mitigation. Extensive simulations and implementations of our Secure NTT on Artix-7 FPGA with different Kyber variants show that our fault detection and correction modules can efficiently detect and correct faults whether caused unintentionally or intentionally by hardware Trojans with a high success rate, while introducing only modest area and time overheads.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22804v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SOMBRERO: Measuring and Steering Boundary Placement in End-to-End Hierarchical Sequence Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22805</link><description>arXiv:2601.22805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical sequence models replace fixed tokenization with learned segmentations that compress long byte sequences for efficient autoregressive modeling. While recent end-to-end methods can learn meaningful boundaries from the language-modeling objective alone, it remains difficult to quantitatively assess and systematically steer where compute is spent. We introduce a router-agnostic metric of boundary quality, boundary enrichment B, which measures how strongly chunk starts concentrate on positions with high next-byte surprisal. Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22805v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aligning the Unseen in Attributed Graphs: Interplay between Graph Geometry and Node Attributes Manifold</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22806</link><description>arXiv:2601.22806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard approach to representation learning on attributed graphs -- i.e., simultaneously reconstructing node attributes and graph structure -- is geometrically flawed, as it merges two potentially incompatible metric spaces. This forces a destructive alignment that erodes information about the graph's underlying generative process. To recover this lost signal, we introduce a custom variational autoencoder that separates manifold learning from structural alignment. By quantifying the metric distortion needed to map the attribute manifold onto the graph's Heat Kernel, we transform geometric conflict into an interpretable structural descriptor. Experiments show our method uncovers connectivity patterns and anomalies undetectable by conventional approaches, proving both their theoretical inadequacy and practical limitations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diachronic Stereo Matching for Multi-Date Satellite Imagery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22808</link><description>arXiv:2601.22808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in image-based satellite 3D reconstruction have progressed along two complementary directions. On one hand, multi-date approaches using NeRF or Gaussian-splatting jointly model appearance and geometry across many acquisitions, achieving accurate reconstructions on opportunistic imagery with numerous observations. On the other hand, classical stereoscopic reconstruction pipelines deliver robust and scalable results for simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous image pairs. However, when the two images are captured months apart, strong seasonal, illumination, and shadow changes violate standard stereoscopic assumptions, causing existing pipelines to fail. This work presents the first Diachronic Stereo Matching method for satellite imagery, enabling reliable 3D reconstruction from temporally distant pairs. Two advances make this possible: (1) fine-tuning a state-of-the-art deep stereo network that leverages monocular depth priors, and (2) exposing it to a dataset specifically curated to include a diverse set of diachronic image pairs. In particular, we start from a pretrained MonSter model, trained initially on a mix of synthetic and real datasets such as SceneFlow and KITTI, and fine-tune it on a set of stereo pairs derived from the DFC2019 remote sensing challenge. This dataset contains both synchronic and diachronic pairs under diverse seasonal and illumination conditions. Experiments on multi-date WorldView-3 imagery demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses classical pipelines and unadapted deep stereo models on both synchronic and diachronic settings. Fine-tuning on temporally diverse images, together with monocular priors, proves essential for enabling 3D reconstruction from previously incompatible acquisition dates.

Abstract: Existing methods for farmland remote sensing image (FRSI) segmentation generally follow a static segmentation paradigm, where analysis relies solely on the limited information contained within a single input patch. Consequently, their reasoning capability is limited when dealing with complex scenes characterized by ambiguity and visual uncertainty. In contrast, human experts, when interpreting remote sensing images in such ambiguous cases, tend to actively query auxiliary images (such as higher-resolution, larger-scale, or temporally adjacent data) to conduct cross-verification and achieve more comprehensive reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a reasoning-query-driven dynamic segmentation framework for FRSIs, named FarmMind. This framework breaks through the limitations of the static segmentation paradigm by introducing a reasoning-query mechanism, which dynamically and on-demand queries external auxiliary images to compensate for the insufficient information in a single input image. Unlike direct queries, this mechanism simulates the thinking process of human experts when faced with segmentation ambiguity: it first analyzes the root causes of segmentation ambiguities through reasoning, and then determines what type of auxiliary image needs to be queried based on this analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FarmMind achieves superior segmentation performance and stronger generalization ability compared with existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as artificial agents offer the potential for scalable behavioral research, yet their validity depends on whether LLMs can maintain stable personas across extended conversations. We address this point using a dual-assessment framework measuring both self-reported characteristics and observer-rated persona expression. Across two experiments testing four persona conditions (default, high, moderate, and low ADHD presentations), seven LLMs, and three semantically equivalent persona prompts, we examine between-conversation stability (3,473 conversations) and within-conversation stability (1,370 conversations and 18 turns). Self-reports remain highly stable both between and within conversations. However, observer ratings reveal a tendency for persona expressions to decline during extended conversations. These findings suggest that persona-instructed LLMs produce stable, persona-aligned self-reports, an important prerequisite for behavioral research, while identifying this regression tendency as a boundary condition for multi-agent social simulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22812v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quartet II: Accurate LLM Pre-Training in NVFP4 by Improved Unbiased Gradient Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22813</link><description>arXiv:2601.22813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NVFP4 lower-precision format, supported in hardware by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, promises to allow, for the first time, end-to-end fully-quantized pre-training of massive models such as LLMs. Yet, existing quantized training methods still sacrifice some of the representation capacity of this format in favor of more accurate unbiased quantized gradient estimation by stochastic rounding (SR), losing noticeable accuracy relative to standard FP16 and FP8 training. In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have recently been adapted to tabular data containing discrete and continuous features. However, generating mixed-type features that combine discrete states with an otherwise continuous distribution in a single feature remains challenging. We advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models for tabular data with a cascaded approach. We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features. We formally prove that this cascade tightens the transport cost bound. The results indicate that our model generates significantly more realistic samples and captures distributional details more accurately, for example, the detection score increases by 40%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22816v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hide and Seek in Embedding Space: Geometry-based Steganography and Detection in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22818</link><description>arXiv:2601.22818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuned LLMs can covertly encode prompt secrets into outputs via steganographic channels. Prior work demonstrated this threat but relied on trivially recoverable encodings. We formalize payload recoverability via classifier accuracy and show previous schemes achieve 100\% recoverability. In response, we introduce low-recoverability steganography, replacing arbitrary mappings with embedding-space-derived ones. For Llama-8B (LoRA) and Ministral-8B (LoRA) trained on TrojanStego prompts, exact secret recovery rises from 17$\rightarrow$30\% (+78\%) and 24$\rightarrow$43\% (+80\%) respectively, while on Llama-70B (LoRA) trained on Wiki prompts, it climbs from 9$\rightarrow$19\% (+123\%), all while reducing payload recoverability. We then discuss detection. We argue that detecting fine-tuning-based steganographic attacks requires approaches beyond traditional steganalysis. Standard approaches measure distributional shift, which is an expected side-effect of fine-tuning. Instead, we propose a mechanistic interpretability approach: linear probes trained on later-layer activations detect the secret with up to 33\% higher accuracy in fine-tuned models compared to base models, even for low-recoverability schemes. This suggests that malicious fine-tuning leaves actionable internal signatures amenable to interpretability-based defenses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22818v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] User-Adaptive Meta-Learning for Cold-Start Medication Recommendation with Uncertainty Filtering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22820</link><description>arXiv:2601.22820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases have become indispensable in supporting clinical decision-making through data-driven treatment recommendations. However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets. Experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that MetaDrug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation methods on cold-start patients.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22820v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Offline Reinforcement Learning of High-Quality Behaviors Under Robust Style Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22823</link><description>arXiv:2601.22823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning of style-conditioned policies using explicit style supervision via subtrajectory labeling functions. In this setting, aligning style with high task performance is particularly challenging due to distribution shift and inherent conflicts between style and reward. Existing methods, despite introducing numerous definitions of style, often fail to reconcile these objectives effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a unified definition of behavior style and instantiate it into a practical framework. Building on this, we introduce Style-Conditioned Implicit Q-Learning (SCIQL), which leverages offline goal-conditioned RL techniques, such as hindsight relabeling and value learning, and combine it with a new Gated Advantage Weighted Regression mechanism to efficiently optimize task performance while preserving style alignment. Experiments demonstrate that SCIQL achieves superior performance on both objectives compared to prior offline methods.

Abstract: We study fully-discrete approximations and quadratures of infinite-variate functions in abstract Bochner spaces associated with a Hilbert space $X$ and an infinite-tensor-product Jacobi measure. For target infinite-variate functions taking values in $X$ which admit absolutely convergent Jacobi generalized polynomial chaos expansions, with suitable weighted summability conditions for the coefficient sequences, we generalize and improve prior results on construction of sequences of finite sparse-grid tensor-product polynomial interpolation approximations and quadratures, based on the univariate Chebyshev points. For a generic stable discretization of $X$ in terms of a dense sequence $(V_m)_{m \in \mathbb{N}_0}$ of finite-dimensional subspaces, we obtain fully-discrete, linear approximations in terms of so-called sparse-grid tensor-product projectors, with convergence rates of approximations as well as of sparse-grid tensor-product quadratures of the target functions.
  We verify the abstract assumptions in two fundamental application settings: first, a linear elliptic diffusion equation with affine-parametric coefficients and second, abstract holomorphic maps between separable Hilbert spaces with affine-parametric input data encoding. For these settings, as in [37,20], cancellation of anti-symmetric terms in ultra-spherical Jacobi generalized polynomial chaos expansion coefficients implies crucially improved convergence rates of sparse-grid tensor-product quadrature with respect to the infinite-tensor-product Jacobi weight, free from the ``curse-of-dimension".
  Largely self-contained proofs of all results are developed. Approximation convergence rate results in the present setting which are based on construction of neural network surrogates, for unbounded parameter ranges with Gaussian measures, will be developed in extensions of the present work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22825v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decomposing and Composing: Towards Efficient Vision-Language Continual Learning via Rank-1 Expert Pool in a Single LoRA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22828</link><description>arXiv:2601.22828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in vision-language models (VLMs) faces significant challenges in improving task adaptation and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators. The merged LoRAs retain less weights and incur no inference latency, making our method computationally lightweight.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22828v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Comparative Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models for 2D Object Detection under SOTIF Conditions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22830</link><description>arXiv:2601.22830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable environmental perception remains one of the main obstacles for safe operation of automated vehicles. Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) concerns safety risks from perception insufficiencies, particularly under adverse conditions where conventional detectors often falter. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising semantic reasoning, their quantitative effectiveness for safety-critical 2D object detection is underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of semantic reasoning versus geometric regression, supporting the use of LVLMs as high-level safety validators in SOTIF-oriented automated driving systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22830v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Pluralizing Reflection in HCI through Daoism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22831</link><description>arXiv:2601.22831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflection is fundamental to how people make sense of everyday life, helping them navigate moments of growth, uncertainty, and change. Yet in HCI, existing frameworks of designing technologies to support reflection remain narrow, emphasizing cognitive, rational problem-solving, and individual self-improvement. We introduce Daoist philosophy as a non-Western lens to broaden this scope and reimagine reflective practices in interactive systems. Combining insights from Daoist literature with semi-structured interviews with 18 Daoist priests, scholars, and practitioners, we identified three key dimensions of everyday reflection: Stillness, Resonance, and Emergence. These dimensions reveal emergent, embodied, relational, and ethically driven qualities often overlooked in HCI research. We articulate their potential to inform alternative frameworks for interactive systems for reflection, advocating a shift from reflection toward reflecting-with, and highlight the potential of Daoism as an epistemological resource for the HCI community.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22831v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Just-in-Time Catching Test Generation at Meta</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22832</link><description>arXiv:2601.22832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on Just-in-Time catching test generation at Meta, designed to prevent bugs in large scale backend systems of hundreds of millions of line of code. Unlike traditional hardening tests, which pass at generation time, catching tests are meant to fail, surfacing bugs before code lands. The primary challenge is to reduce development drag from false positive test failures. Analyzing 22,126 generated tests, we show code-change-aware methods improve candidate catch generation 4x over hardening tests and 20x over coincidentally failing tests. To address false positives, we use rule-based and LLM-based assessors. These assessors reduce human review load by 70%. Inferential statistical analysis showed that human-accepted code changes are assessed to have significantly more false positives, while human-rejected changes have significantly more true positives. We reported 41 candidate catches to engineers; 8 were confirmed to be true positives, 4 of which would have led to serious failures had they remained uncaught. Overall, our results show that Just-in-Time catching is scalable, industrially applicable, and that it prevents serious failures from reaching production.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22832v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NativeTok: Native Visual Tokenization for Improved Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22837</link><description>arXiv:2601.22837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VQ-based image generation typically follows a two-stage pipeline: a tokenizer encodes images into discrete tokens, and a generative model learns their dependencies for reconstruction. However, improved tokenization in the first stage does not necessarily enhance the second-stage generation, as existing methods fail to constrain token dependencies. This mismatch forces the generative model to learn from unordered distributions, leading to bias and weak coherence. To address this, we propose native visual tokenization, which enforces causal dependencies during tokenization. Building on this idea, we introduce NativeTok, a framework that achieves efficient reconstruction while embedding relational constraints within token sequences. NativeTok consists of: (1) a Meta Image Transformer (MIT) for latent image modeling, and (2) a Mixture of Causal Expert Transformer (MoCET), where each lightweight expert block generates a single token conditioned on prior tokens and latent features. We further design a Hierarchical Native Training strategy that updates only new expert blocks, ensuring training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NativeTok.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22837v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Clothing Tryer: Customized Virtual Try-On via Semantic Enhancement and Controlling Diffusion Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22838</link><description>arXiv:2601.22838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to address a novel Customized Virtual Try-ON (Cu-VTON) task, enabling the superimposition of a specified garment onto a model that can be customized in terms of appearance, posture, and additional attributes. Compared with traditional VTON task, it enables users to tailor digital avatars to their individual preferences, thereby enhancing the virtual fitting experience with greater flexibility and engagement. To address this task, we introduce a Neural Clothing Tryer (NCT) framework, which exploits the advanced diffusion models equipped with semantic enhancement and controlling modules to better preserve semantic characterization and textural details of the garment and meanwhile facilitating the flexible editing of the model's postures and appearances. Specifically, NCT introduces a semantic-enhanced module to take semantic descriptions of garments and utilizes a visual-language encoder to learn aligned features across modalities. The aligned features are served as condition input to the diffusion model to enhance the preservation of the garment's semantics. Then, a semantic controlling module is designed to take the garment image, tailored posture image, and semantic description as input to maintain garment details while simultaneously editing model postures, expressions, and various attributes. Extensive experiments on the open available benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed NCT framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22838v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Much of a Model Do We Need?

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models (FMs) in remote sensing (RS) are developed based on the paradigms established in computer vision (CV) and have shown promise for various Earth observation applications. However, the direct transfer of scaling assumptions from CV to RS has not been adequately examined. We hypothesize that RS FMs enter an overparameterized regime at substantially smaller scales than their CV counterparts, where increasing parameter count primarily induces redundant representations rather than qualitatively new abstractions. To test this hypothesis, we use post-hoc slimming, where we uniformly reduce the width of pretrained encoder, as a tool to measure representational redundancy across six state-of-the-art RS FMs on four downstream classification tasks. Our findings reveal a significant contrast with those in the CV domain: while a post-hoc slimmed masked autoencoder (MAE) trained on ImageNet retains less than 10% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, RS FMs maintain over 71% relative accuracy at the same budget. This sevenfold difference provides strong empirical support for our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that learned slimmable training can improve both Momentum Contrast (MoCo)- and MAE- based models. In addition, through the explained variance ratio and the feature correlation analysis, we provide mechanistic explanations showing that RS FMs distribute task-relevant information with high redundancy. Our findings establish post-hoc slimmability as both a practical deployment strategy for resource-constrained environments and a diagnostic tool that challenges the prevailing scaling paradigm in RS. Upon acceptance, we will publish all code.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22841v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unconditional flow-based time series generation with equivariance-regularised latent spaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22848</link><description>arXiv:2601.22848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-based models have proven successful for time-series generation, particularly when defined in lower-dimensional latent spaces that enable efficient sampling. However, how to design latent representations with desirable equivariance properties for time-series generative modelling remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a latent flow-matching framework in which equivariance is explicitly encouraged through a simple regularisation of a pre-trained autoencoder. Specifically, we introduce an equivariance loss that enforces consistency between transformed signals and their reconstructions, and use it to fine-tune latent spaces with respect to basic time-series transformations such as translation and amplitude scaling. We show that these equivariance-regularised latent spaces improve generation quality while preserving the computational advantages of latent flow models. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based baselines in standard time-series generation metrics, while achieving orders-of-magnitude faster sampling. These results highlight the practical benefits of incorporating geometric inductive biases into latent generative models for time series.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22848v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Rigid Body Assembly via Contact-Implicit Optimal Control with Exact Second-Order Derivatives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22849</link><description>arXiv:2601.22849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient planning of assembly motions is a long standing challenge in the field of robotics that has been primarily tackled with reinforcement learning and sampling-based methods by using extensive physics simulations. This paper proposes a sample-efficient robust optimal control approach for the determination of assembly motions, which requires significantly less physics simulation steps during planning through the efficient use of derivative information. To this end, a differentiable physics simulation is constructed that provides second-order analytic derivatives to the numerical solver and allows one to traverse seamlessly from informative derivatives to accurate contact simulation. The solution of the physics simulation problem is made differentiable by using smoothing inspired by interior-point methods applied to both the collision detection as well as the contact resolution problem. We propose a modified variant of an optimization-based formulation of collision detection formulated as a linear program and present an efficient implementation for the nominal evaluation and corresponding first- and second-order derivatives. Moreover, a multi-scenario-based trajectory optimization problem that ensures robustness with respect to sim-to-real mismatches is derived. The capability of the considered formulation is illustrated by results where over 99\% successful executions are achieved in real-world experiments. Thereby, we carefully investigate the effect of smooth approximations of the contact dynamics and robust modeling on the success rates. Furthermore, the method's capability is tested on different peg-in-hole problems in simulation to show the benefit of using exact Hessians over commonly used Hessian approximations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Meanings Meet: Investigating the Emergence and Quality of Shared Concept Spaces during Multilingual Language Model Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22851</link><description>arXiv:2601.22851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with high multilingual coverage is becoming increasingly important -- especially when monolingual resources are scarce. Recent studies have found that LLMs process multilingual inputs in shared concept spaces, thought to support generalization and cross-lingual transfer. However, these prior studies often do not use causal methods, lack deeper error analysis or focus on the final model only, leaving open how these spaces emerge during training. We investigate the development of language-agnostic concept spaces during pretraining of EuroLLM through the causal interpretability method of activation patching. We isolate cross-lingual concept representations, then inject them into a translation prompt to investigate how consistently translations can be altered, independently of the language. We find that shared concept spaces emerge early} and continue to refine, but that alignment with them is language-dependent}. Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our fine-grained manual analysis reveals that some apparent gains in translation quality reflect shifts in behavior -- like selecting senses for polysemous words or translating instead of copying cross-lingual homographs -- rather than improved translation ability. Our findings offer new insight into the training dynamics of cross-lingual alignment and the conditions under which causal interpretability methods offer meaningful insights in multilingual contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22851v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Shift Mixing -- Beyond Dense Attention in Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22852</link><description>arXiv:2601.22852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of the Transformer architecture for large language models, the softmax-based attention layer has faced increasing scrutinity due to its quadratic-time computational complexity. Attempts have been made to replace it with less complex methods, at the cost of reduced performance in most cases. We introduce Hierarchical Shift Mixing (HSM), a general framework for token mixing that distributes pairwise token interactions across Transformer layers rather than computing them densely within each layer. HSM enables linear-time complexity while remaining agnostic to the specific mixing function. We show that even simple HSM variants achieve performance close to softmax attention, and that hybrid architectures combining HSM with softmax attention can outperform a GPT-style Transformer baseline while reducing computational cost during both training and inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22852v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inference-Time Dynamic Modality Selection for Incomplete Multimodal Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22853</link><description>arXiv:2601.22853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet its practical deployment is often hindered by incomplete multimodal data. Existing incomplete MDL methods either discard missing modalities, risking the loss of valuable task-relevant information, or recover them, potentially introducing irrelevant noise, leading to the discarding-imputation dilemma. To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample. Since direct estimation of such information at test time is intractable due to the unknown data distribution, we theoretically establish a connection between information and the task loss, which we compute at inference time as a tractable proxy. Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection. In addition, we design a flexible multimodal network architecture compatible with arbitrary modality combinations, alongside a tailored training strategy for robust representation learning. Extensive experiments on diverse natural and medical image datasets show that DyMo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete/dynamic MDL methods across various missing-data scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MAGs) have been widely adopted for modeling complex systems by integrating multi-modal information, such as text and images, on nodes. However, we identify a discrepancy between the implicit semantic structure induced by different modality embeddings and the explicit graph structure. For instance, neighbors in the explicit graph structure may be close in one modality but distant in another. Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing multimodal graph models, acting as an effective drop-in regularizer. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMAG consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks, ranging from graph-centric tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction) to multimodal-centric generation tasks (e.g., graph2text, graph2image). The source code will be available upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22856v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Build Shapes by Extrusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22858</link><description>arXiv:2601.22858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Text Encoded Extrusion (TEE), a text-based representation that expresses mesh construction as sequences of face extrusions rather than polygon lists, and a method for generating 3D meshes from TEE using a large language model (LLM). By learning extrusion sequences that assemble a mesh, similar to the way artists create meshes, our approach naturally supports arbitrary output face counts and produces manifold meshes by design, in contrast to recent transformer-based models. The learnt extrusion sequences can also be applied to existing meshes - enabling editing in addition to generation. To train our model, we decompose a library of quadrilateral meshes with non-self-intersecting face loops into constituent loops, which can be viewed as their building blocks, and finetune an LLM on the steps for reassembling the meshes by performing a sequence of extrusions. We demonstrate that our representation enables reconstruction, novel shape synthesis, and the addition of new features to existing meshes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22858v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MEnvAgent: Scalable Polyglot Environment Construction for Verifiable Software Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22859</link><description>arXiv:2601.22859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for software engineering (SWE) is constrained by the scarcity of verifiable datasets, a bottleneck stemming from the complexity of constructing executable environments across diverse languages. To address this, we introduce MEnvAgent, a Multi-language framework for automated Environment construction that facilitates scalable generation of verifiable task instances. MEnvAgent employs a multi-agent Planning-Execution-Verification architecture to autonomously resolve construction failures and integrates a novel Environment Reuse Mechanism that reduces computational overhead by incrementally patching historical environments. Evaluations on MEnvBench, a new benchmark comprising 1,000 tasks across 10 languages, demonstrate that MEnvAgent outperforms baselines, improving Fail-to-Pass (F2P) rates by 8.6% while reducing time costs by 43%. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of MEnvAgent by constructing MEnvData-SWE, the largest open-source polyglot dataset of realistic verifiable Docker environments to date, alongside solution trajectories that enable consistent performance gains on SWE tasks across a wide range of models. Our code, benchmark, and dataset are available at https://github.com/ernie-research/MEnvAgent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22859v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Interpolating Neural Network (B-INN): a scalable and reliable Bayesian model for large-scale physical systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22860</link><description>arXiv:2601.22860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks and machine learning models for uncertainty quantification suffer from limited scalability and poor reliability compared to their deterministic counterparts. In industry-scale active learning settings, where generating a single high-fidelity simulation may require days or weeks of computation and produce data volumes on the order of gigabytes, they quickly become impractical. This paper proposes a scalable and reliable Bayesian surrogate model, termed the Bayesian Interpolating Neural Network (B-INN). The B-INN combines high-order interpolation theory with tensor decomposition and alternating direction algorithm to enable effective dimensionality reduction without compromising predictive accuracy. We theoretically show that the function space of a B-INN is a subset of that of Gaussian processes, while its Bayesian inference exhibits linear complexity, $\mathcal{O}(N)$, with respect to the number of training samples. Numerical experiments demonstrate that B-INNs can be from 20 times to 10,000 times faster with a robust uncertainty estimation compared to Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes. These capabilities make B-INN a practical foundation for uncertainty-driven active learning in large-scale industrial simulations, where computational efficiency and robust uncertainty calibration are paramount.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22860v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Under-Canopy Terrain Reconstruction in Dense Forests Using RGB Imaging and Neural 3D Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22861</link><description>arXiv:2601.22861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping the terrain and understory hidden beneath dense forest canopies is of great interest for numerous applications such as search and rescue, trail mapping, forest inventory tasks, and more. Existing solutions rely on specialized sensors: either heavy, costly airborne LiDAR, or Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), which uses thermal synthetic aperture photography and is tailored for person detection.
  We introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB images. Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.
  To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images). Additionally, we show the potential of our approach for forest inventory tasks like tree counting. These results position our approach as a cost-effective, high-resolution alternative to specialized sensors for SAR, trail mapping, and forest-inventory tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22861v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Design of a GPU with Heterogeneous Cores for Graphics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22862</link><description>arXiv:2601.22862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous architectures can deliver higher performance and energy efficiency than symmetric counterparts by using multiple architectures tuned to different types of workloads. While previous works focused on CPUs, this work extends the concept of heterogeneity to GPUs by proposing KHEPRI, a heterogeneous GPU architecture for graphics applications. Scenes in graphics applications showcase diversity, as they consist of many objects with varying levels of complexity. As a result, computational intensity and memory bandwidth requirements differ significantly across different regions of each scene. To address this variability, our proposal includes two types of cores: cores optimized for high ILP (compute-specialized) and cores that tolerate a higher number of simultaneously outstanding cache misses (memory-specialized). A key component of the proposed architecture is a novel work scheduler that dynamically assigns each part of a frame (i.e., a tile) to the most suitable core. Designing this scheduler is particularly challenging, as it must preserve data locality; otherwise, the benefits of heterogeneity may be offset by the penalty of additional cache misses. Additionally, the scheduler requires knowledge of each tile's characteristics before rendering it. For this purpose, KHEPRI leverages frame-to-frame coherence to predict the behavior of each tile based on that of the corresponding tile in the previous frame. Evaluations across a wide range of commercial animated graphics applications show that, compared to a traditional homogeneous GPU, KHEPRI achieves an average performance improvement of 9.2%, a throughput increase (frames per second) of 7.3%, and a total GPU energy reduction of 4.8%. Importantly, these benefits are achieved without any hardware overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22862v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] {\mu}Touch: Enabling Accurate, Lightweight Self-Touch Sensing with Passive Magnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22864</link><description>arXiv:2601.22864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-touch gestures (e.g., nuanced facial touches and subtle finger scratches) provide rich insights into human behaviors, from hygiene practices to health monitoring. However, existing approaches fall short in detecting such micro gestures due to their diverse movement patterns.
  This paper presents {\mu}Touch, a novel magnetic sensing platform for self-touch gesture recognition. {\mu}Touch features (1) a compact hardware design with low-power magnetometers and magnetic silicon, (2) a lightweight semi-supervised framework requiring minimal user data, and (3) an ambient field detection module to mitigate environmental interference. We evaluated {\mu}Touch in two representative applications in user studies with 11 and 12 participants. {\mu}Touch only requires three-second fine-tuning data for each gesture, and new users need less than one minute before starting to use the system. {\mu}Touch can distinguish eight different face-touching behaviors with an average accuracy of 93.41%, and reliably detect body-scratch behaviors with an average accuracy of 94.63%. {\mu}Touch demonstrates accurate and robust sensing performance even after a month, showcasing its potential as a practical tool for hygiene monitoring and dermatological health applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22864v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Degradation-Aware Frequency Regulation of a Heterogeneous Battery Fleet via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22865</link><description>arXiv:2601.22865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery energy storage systems are increasingly deployed as fast-responding resources for grid balancing services such as frequency regulation and for mitigating renewable generation uncertainty. However, repeated charging and discharging induces cycling degradation and reduces battery lifetime. This paper studies the real-time scheduling of a heterogeneous battery fleet that collectively tracks a stochastic balancing signal subject to per-battery ramp-rate and capacity constraints, while minimizing long-term cycling degradation.
  Cycling degradation is fundamentally path-dependent: it is determined by charge-discharge cycles formed by the state-of-charge (SoC) trajectory and is commonly quantified via rainflow cycle counting. This non-Markovian structure makes it difficult to express degradation as an additive per-time-step cost, complicating classical dynamic programming approaches. We address this challenge by formulating the fleet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with constrained action space and designing a dense proxy reward that provides informative feedback at each time step while remaining aligned with long-term cycle-depth reduction.
  To scale learning to large state-action spaces induced by fine-grained SoC discretization and asymmetric per-battery constraints, we develop a function-approximation reinforcement learning method using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a random nonlinear feature map combined with linear temporal-difference learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on a toy Markovian signal model and on a Markovian model trained from real-world regulation signal traces obtained from the University of Delaware, and demonstrate consistent reductions in cycle-depth occurrence and degradation metrics compared to baseline scheduling policies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22865v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Randomized Methods for Kernelized DMD</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22867</link><description>arXiv:2601.22867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven method related to Koopman operator theory that extracts information about dominant dynamics from data snapshots. In this paper we examine techniques to accelerate the application of DMD to large-scale data sets with an eye on randomized techniques. Randomized techniques exploit low-rank matrix approximations at a much smaller computational cost, therefore permitting the use of increased data set sizes. In particular, we propose the application of the RPCholesky algorithm in the setting of kernelized DMD (KDMD). This algorithm relies on adaptive randomized sampling to approximate positive semidefinite kernel matrices and provides better stability guarantees than previously implemented randomized methods for KDMD. Differences between existing competitive randomized techniques and our proposed implementation are discussed with a focus on numerical stability and tradeoff between exploration and exploitation of information obtained from data. The efficacy of this new combination of algorithms is demonstrated on well-established benchmark problems from DMD literature increasing in problem dimension.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22867v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Anomalies Depend on Context: Learning Conditional Compatibility for Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22868</link><description>arXiv:2601.22868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is often formulated under the assumption that abnormality is an intrinsic property of an observation, independent of context. This assumption breaks down in many real-world settings, where the same object or action may be normal or anomalous depending on latent contextual factors (e.g., running on a track versus on a highway). We revisit \emph{contextual anomaly detection}, classically defined as context-dependent abnormality, and operationalize it in the visual domain, where anomaly labels depend on subject--context compatibility rather than intrinsic appearance. To enable systematic study of this setting, we introduce CAAD-3K, a benchmark that isolates contextual anomalies by controlling subject identity while varying context. We further propose a conditional compatibility learning framework that leverages vision--language representations to model subject--context relationships under limited supervision. Our method substantially outperforms existing approaches on CAAD-3K and achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA, demonstrating that modeling context dependence complements traditional structural anomaly detection. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22868v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Eroding the Truth-Default: A Causal Analysis of Human Susceptibility to Foundation Model Hallucinations and Disinformation in the Wild</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22871</link><description>arXiv:2601.22871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As foundation models (FMs) approach human-level fluency, distinguishing synthetic from organic content has become a key challenge for Trustworthy Web Intelligence.
  This paper presents JudgeGPT and RogueGPT, a dual-axis framework that decouples "authenticity" from "attribution" to investigate the mechanisms of human susceptibility. Analyzing 918 evaluations across five FMs (including GPT-4 and Llama-2), we employ Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as a principal framework for formulating testable causal hypotheses about detection accuracy.
  Contrary to partisan narratives, we find that political orientation shows a negligible association with detection performance ($r=-0.10$). Instead, "fake news familiarity" emerges as a candidate mediator ($r=0.35$), suggesting that exposure may function as adversarial training for human discriminators. We identify a "fluency trap" where GPT-4 outputs (HumanMachineScore: 0.20) bypass Source Monitoring mechanisms, rendering them indistinguishable from human text.
  These findings suggest that "pre-bunking" interventions should target cognitive source monitoring rather than demographic segmentation to ensure trustworthy information ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22871v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Labels to Facets: Building a Taxonomically Enriched Turkish Learner Corpus</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22875</link><description>arXiv:2601.22875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In terms of annotation structure, most learner corpora rely on holistic flat label inventories which, even when extensive, do not explicitly separate multiple linguistic dimensions. This makes linguistically deep annotation difficult and complicates fine-grained analyses aimed at understanding why and how learners produce specific errors. To address these limitations, this paper presents a semi-automated annotation methodology for learner corpora, built upon a recently proposed faceted taxonomy, and implemented through a novel annotation extension framework. The taxonomy provides a theoretically grounded, multi-dimensional categorization that captures the linguistic properties underlying each error instance, thereby enabling standardized, fine-grained, and interpretable enrichment beyond flat annotations. The annotation extension tool, implemented based on the proposed extension framework for Turkish, automatically extends existing flat annotations by inferring additional linguistic and metadata information as facets within the taxonomy to provide richer learner-specific context. It was systematically evaluated and yielded promising performance results, achieving a facet-level accuracy of 95.86%. The resulting taxonomically enriched corpus offers enhanced querying capabilities and supports detailed exploratory analyses across learner corpora, enabling researchers to investigate error patterns through complex linguistic and pedagogical dimensions. This work introduces the first collaboratively annotated and taxonomically enriched Turkish Learner Corpus, a manual annotation guideline with a refined tagset, and an annotation extender. As the first corpus designed in accordance with the recently introduced taxonomy, we expect our study to pave the way for subsequent enrichment efforts of existing error-annotated learner corpora.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22875v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Matterhorn: Efficient Analog Sparse Spiking Transformer Architecture with Masked Time-To-First-Spike Encoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22876</link><description>arXiv:2601.22876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising candidate for energy-efficient LLM inference. However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs. On the GLUE benchmark, Matterhorn establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing existing SNNs by 1.42% in average accuracy while delivering a 2.31 times improvement in energy efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22876v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synthetic Time Series Generation via Complex Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22879</link><description>arXiv:2601.22879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series data are essential for a wide range of applications, particularly in developing robust machine learning models. However, access to high-quality datasets is often limited due to privacy concerns, acquisition costs, and labeling challenges. Synthetic time series generation has emerged as a promising solution to address these constraints. In this work, we present a framework for generating synthetic time series by leveraging complex networks mappings. Specifically, we investigate whether time series transformed into Quantile Graphs (QG) -- and then reconstructed via inverse mapping -- can produce synthetic data that preserve the statistical and structural properties of the original. We evaluate the fidelity and utility of the generated data using both simulated and real-world datasets, and compare our approach against state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) methods. Results indicate that our quantile graph-based methodology offers a competitive and interpretable alternative for synthetic time series generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22879v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Learning-Based Co-Design and Operation of Chiller and Thermal Energy Storage for Cost-Optimal HVAC Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22880</link><description>arXiv:2601.22880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the joint operation and sizing of cooling infrastructure for commercial HVAC systems using reinforcement learning, with the objective of minimizing life-cycle cost over a 30-year horizon. The cooling system consists of a fixed-capacity electric chiller and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit, jointly operated to meet stochastic hourly cooling demands under time-varying electricity prices. The life-cycle cost accounts for both capital expenditure and discounted operating cost, including electricity consumption and maintenance. A key challenge arises from the strong asymmetry in capital costs: increasing chiller capacity by one unit is far more expensive than an equivalent increase in TES capacity. As a result, identifying the right combination of chiller and TES sizes, while ensuring zero loss-of-cooling-load under optimal operation, is a non-trivial co-design problem. To address this, we formulate the chiller operation problem for a fixed infrastructure configuration as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the control action is the chiller part-load ratio (PLR). The MDP is solved using a Deep Q Network (DQN) with a constrained action space. The learned DQN RL policy minimizes electricity cost over historical traces of cooling demand and electricity prices. For each candidate chiller-TES sizing configuration, the trained policy is evaluated. We then restrict attention to configurations that fully satisfy the cooling demand and perform a life-cycle cost minimization over this feasible set to identify the cost-optimal infrastructure design. Using this approach, we determine the optimal chiller and thermal energy storage capacities to be 700 and 1500, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AnoMod: A Dataset for Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis in Microservice Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22881</link><description>arXiv:2601.22881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microservice systems (MSS) have become a predominant architectural style for cloud services. Yet the community still lacks high-quality, publicly available datasets for anomaly detection (AD) and root cause analysis (RCA) in MSS. Most benchmarks emphasize performance-related faults and provide only one or two monitoring modalities, limiting research on broader failure modes and cross-modal methods. To address these gaps, we introduce a new multimodal anomaly dataset built on two open-source microservice systems: SocialNetwork and TrainTicket. We design and inject four categories of anomalies (Ano): performance-level, service-level, database-level, and code-level, to emulate realistic anomaly modes. For each scenario, we collect five modalities (Mod): logs, metrics, distributed traces, API responses, and code coverage reports, offering a richer, end-to-end view of system state and inter-service interactions. We name our dataset, reflecting its unique properties, as AnoMod. This dataset enables (1) evaluation of cross-modal anomaly detection and fusion/ablation strategies, and (2) fine-grained RCA studies across service and code regions, supporting end-to-end troubleshooting pipelines that jointly consider detection and localization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22881v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging LLMs For Turkish Skill Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22885</link><description>arXiv:2601.22885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skill extraction is a critical component of modern recruitment systems, enabling efficient job matching, personalized recommendations, and labor market analysis. Despite T\"urkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature. Our findings suggest that LLMs can improve skill extraction performance in low-resource settings, and we hope that our work will accelerate similar research on skill extraction for underrepresented languages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22885v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MoVE: Mixture of Value Embeddings -- A New Axis for Scaling Parametric Memory in Autoregressive Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22887</link><description>arXiv:2601.22887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive sequence modeling stands as the cornerstone of modern Generative AI, powering results across diverse modalities ranging from text generation to image generation. However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation. In both domains, MoVE yields consistent performance improvements over standard and layer-wise memory baselines, enabling the construction of "memory-dense" models that achieve lower perplexity and higher fidelity than their dense counterparts at comparable compute budgets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22887v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Should LLMs, $\textit{like}$, Generate How Users Talk?

Abstract: More than 80% of the 1.6 billion English speakers do not use Standard American English (SAE) and experience higher failure rates and stereotyped responses when interacting with LLMs as a result. Yet multi-dialectal performance remains underexplored. We introduce $\textbf{MDial}$, the first large-scale framework for generating multi-dialectal conversational data encompassing the three pillars of written dialect -- lexical (vocabulary), orthographic (spelling), and morphosyntactic (grammar) features -- for nine English dialects. Partnering with native linguists, we design an annotated and scalable rule-based LLM transformation to ensure precision. Our approach challenges the assumption that models should mirror users' morphosyntactic features, showing that up to 90% of the grammatical features of a dialect should not be reproduced by models. Independent evaluations confirm data quality, with annotators preferring MDial outputs over prior methods in 98% of pairwise comparisons for dialect naturalness. Using this pipeline, we construct the dialect-parallel $\textbf{MDialBench}$mark with 50k+ dialogs, resulting in 97k+ QA pairs, and evaluate 17 LLMs on dialect identification and response generation tasks. Even frontier models achieve under 70% accuracy, fail to reach 50% for Canadian English, and systematically misclassify non-SAE dialects as American or British. As dialect identification underpins natural language understanding, these errors risk cascading failures into downstream tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22888v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiffuSpeech: Silent Thought, Spoken Answer via Unified Speech-Text Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22889</link><description>arXiv:2601.22889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current speech language models generate responses directly without explicit reasoning, leading to errors that cannot be corrected once audio is produced. We introduce \textbf{``Silent Thought, Spoken Answer''} -- a paradigm where speech LLMs generate internal text reasoning alongside spoken responses, with thinking traces informing speech quality. To realize this, we present \method{}, the first diffusion-based speech-text language model supporting both understanding and generation, unifying discrete text and tokenized speech under a single masked diffusion framework. Unlike autoregressive approaches, \method{} jointly generates reasoning traces and speech tokens through iterative denoising, with modality-specific masking schedules. We also construct \dataset{}, the first speech QA dataset with paired text reasoning traces, containing 26K samples totaling 319 hours. Experiments show \method{} achieves state-of-the-art speech-to-speech QA accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by up to 9 points, while attaining the best TTS quality among generative models (6.2\% WER) and preserving language understanding (66.2\% MMLU). Ablations confirm that both the diffusion architecture and thinking traces contribute to these gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22889v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PlatoLTL: Learning to Generalize Across Symbols in LTL Instructions for Multi-Task RL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22891</link><description>arXiv:2601.22891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) is to train generalist policies capable of performing tasks not seen during training. To facilitate such generalization, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently emerged as a powerful formalism for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks to RL agents. While existing approaches to LTL-guided multi-task RL demonstrate successful generalization across LTL specifications, they are unable to generalize to unseen vocabularies of propositions (or "symbols"), which describe high-level events in LTL. We present PlatoLTL, a novel approach that enables policies to zero-shot generalize not only compositionally across LTL formula structures, but also parametrically across propositions. We achieve this by treating propositions as instances of parameterized predicates rather than discrete symbols, allowing policies to learn shared structure across related propositions. We propose a novel architecture that embeds and composes predicates to represent LTL specifications, and demonstrate successful zero-shot generalization to novel propositions and tasks across challenging environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22891v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Machines Get It Wrong: Large Language Models Perpetuate Autism Myths More Than Humans Do</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22893</link><description>arXiv:2601.22893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models become ubiquitous sources of health information, understanding their capacity to accurately represent stigmatized conditions is crucial for responsible deployment. This study examines whether leading AI systems perpetuate or challenge misconceptions about Autism Spectrum Disorder, a condition particularly vulnerable to harmful myths. We administered a 30-item instrument measuring autism knowledge to 178 participants and three state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. Contrary to expectations that AI systems would leverage their vast training data to outperform humans, we found the opposite pattern: human participants endorsed significantly fewer myths than LLMs (36.2% vs. 44.8% error rate; z = -2.59, p = .0048). In 18 of the 30 evaluated items, humans significantly outperformed AI systems. These findings reveal a critical blind spot in current AI systems and have important implications for human-AI interaction design, the epistemology of machine knowledge, and the need to center neurodivergent perspectives in AI development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22893v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Game-Theoretic Co-Evolution for LLM-Based Heuristic Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22896</link><description>arXiv:2601.22896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled rapid progress in automatic heuristic discovery (AHD), yet most existing methods are predominantly limited by static evaluation against fixed instance distributions, leading to potential overfitting and poor generalization under distributional shifts. We propose Algorithm Space Response Oracles (ASRO), a game-theoretic framework that reframes heuristic discovery as a program level co-evolution between solver and instance generator. ASRO models their interaction as a two-player zero-sum game, maintains growing strategy pools on both sides, and iteratively expands them via LLM-based best-response oracles against mixed opponent meta-strategies, thereby replacing static evaluation with an adaptive, self-generated curriculum. Across multiple combinatorial optimization domains, ASRO consistently outperforms static-training AHD baselines built on the same program search mechanisms, achieving substantially improved generalization and robustness on diverse and out-of-distribution instances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22896v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty-Aware Extrapolation in Bayesian Oblique Trees</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22899</link><description>arXiv:2601.22899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision trees are widely used due to their interpretability and efficiency, but they struggle in regression tasks that require reliable extrapolation and well-calibrated uncertainty. Piecewise-constant leaf predictions are bounded by the training targets and often become overconfident under distribution shift. We propose a single-tree Bayesian model that extends VSPYCT by equipping each leaf with a GP predictor. Bayesian oblique splits provide uncertainty-aware partitioning of the input space, while GP leaves model local functional behaviour and enable principled extrapolation beyond the observed target range. We present an efficient inference and prediction scheme that combines posterior sampling of split parameters with \gls{gp} posterior predictions, and a gating mechanism that activates GP-based extrapolation when inputs fall outside the training support of a leaf. Experiments on benchmark regression tasks show improvements in the predictive performance compared to standard variational oblique trees, and substantial performance gains in extrapolation scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22899v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MulFeRL: Enhancing Reinforcement Learning with Verbal Feedback in a Multi-turn Loop</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22900</link><description>arXiv:2601.22900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is widely used to improve reasoning in multiple domains, yet outcome-only scalar rewards are often sparse and uninformative, especially on failed samples, where they merely indicate failure and provide no insight into why the reasoning fails. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage richer verbal feedback to guide RLVR training on failed samples, and how to convert such feedback into a trainable learning signal. Specifically, we propose a multi-turn feedback-guided reinforcement learning framework. It builds on three mechanisms: (1) dynamic multi-turn regeneration guided by feedback, triggered only on failed samples, (2) two complementary learning signals for within-turn and cross-turn optimization, and (3) structured feedback injection into the model's reasoning process. Trained on sampled OpenR1-Math, the approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning and RLVR baselines in-domain and generalizes well out-of-domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22900v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DINO-SAE: DINO Spherical Autoencoder for High-Fidelity Image Reconstruction and Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22904</link><description>arXiv:2601.22904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have explored using pretrained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) such as DINO for generative autoencoders, showing strong generative performance. Unfortunately, existing approaches often suffer from limited reconstruction fidelity due to the loss of high-frequency details. In this work, we present the DINO Spherical Autoencoder (DINO-SAE), a framework that bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction. Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM. Notably, our Riemannian Flow Matching-based DiT exhibits efficient convergence, achieving a gFID of 3.47 at 80 epochs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22904v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlexLoRA: Entropy-Guided Flexible Low-Rank Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22905</link><description>arXiv:2601.22905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable success across diverse domains, yet fully fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT. Extensive experiments show that FlexLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across benchmarks.

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection in real-world industrial settings faces two major limitations. First, most existing methods are trained on purely normal data or on unlabeled datasets assumed to be predominantly normal, presuming the absence of contamination, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice. Second, they assume no access to labeled anomaly samples, limiting the model from learning discriminative characteristics of true anomalies. Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions. Following the few-anomaly paradigm, we incorporate a small set of labeled anomalies during training while simultaneously mitigating the influence of contaminated samples through adaptive instance weighting. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves strong detection and localization performance, interpretability, and robustness under various levels of data contamination.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22913v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMDR: Large language model driven framework for missing data recovery in mixed data under low resource regime</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22916</link><description>arXiv:2601.22916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The missing data problem is one of the important issues to address for achieving data quality. While imputation-based methods are designed to achieve data completeness, their efficacy is observed to be diminishing as and when there is increasing in the missingness percentage. Further, extant approaches often struggle to handle mixed-type datasets, typically supporting either numerical and/or categorical data. In this work, we propose LLMDR, automatic data recovery framework which operates in two stage approach, wherein the Stage-I: DBSCAN clustering algorithm is employed to select the most representative samples and in the Stage-II: Multi-LLMs are employed for data recovery considering the local and global representative samples; Later, this framework invokes the consensus algorithm for recommending a more accurate value based on other LLMs of local and global effective samples. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed framework works effectively on various mixed datasets in terms of Accuracy, KS-Statistic, SMAPE, and MSE. Further, we have also shown the advantage of the consensus mechanism for final recommendation in mixed-type data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22916v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep in the Jungle: Towards Automating Chimpanzee Population Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22917</link><description>arXiv:2601.22917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of abundance and density in unmarked populations of great apes relies on statistical frameworks that require animal-to-camera distance measurements. In practice, acquiring these distances depends on labour-intensive manual interpretation of animal observations across large camera trap video corpora. This study introduces and evaluates an only sparsely explored alternative: the integration of computer vision-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) pipelines directly into ecological camera trap workflows for great ape conservation. Using a real-world dataset of 220 camera trap videos documenting a wild chimpanzee population, we combine two MDE models, Dense Prediction Transformers and Depth Anything, with multiple distance sampling strategies. These components are used to generate detection distance estimates, from which population density and abundance are inferred. Comparative analysis against manually derived ground-truth distances shows that calibrated DPT consistently outperforms Depth Anything. This advantage is observed in both distance estimation accuracy and downstream density and abundance inference. Nevertheless, both models exhibit systematic biases. We show that, given complex forest environments, they tend to overestimate detection distances and consequently underestimate density and abundance relative to conventional manual approaches. We further find that failures in animal detection across distance ranges are a primary factor limiting estimation accuracy. Overall, this work provides a case study that shows MDE-driven camera trap distance sampling is a viable and practical alternative to manual distance estimation. The proposed approach yields population estimates within 22% of those obtained using traditional methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22917v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Serverless Edge-Native Data Processing Architecture for Autonomous Driving Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22919</link><description>arXiv:2601.22919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data is both the key enabler and a major bottleneck for machine learning in autonomous driving. Effective model training requires not only large quantities of sensor data but also balanced coverage that includes rare yet safety-critical scenarios. Capturing such events demands extensive driving time and efficient selection. This paper introduces the Lambda framework, an edge-native platform that enables on-vehicle data filtering and processing through user-defined functions. The framework provides a serverless-inspired abstraction layer that separates application logic from low-level execution concerns such as scheduling, deployment, and isolation. By adapting Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) principles to resource-constrained automotive environments, it allows developers to implement modular, event-driven filtering algorithms while maintaining compatibility with ROS 2 and existing data recording pipelines. We evaluate the framework on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and compare it against native ROS 2 deployments. Results show competitive performance, reduced latency and jitter, and confirm that lambda-based abstractions can support real-time data processing in embedded autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) predicts perceptual quality scores consistent with human judgments. Recent RL-based IQA methods built on MLLMs focus on generating visual quality descriptions and scores, ignoring two key reliability limitations: (i) although the model's prediction stability varies significantly across training samples, existing GRPO-based methods apply uniform advantage weighting, thereby amplifying noisy signals from unstable samples in gradient updates; (ii) most works emphasize text-grounded reasoning over images while overlooking the model's visual perception ability of image content. In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization. To strengthen perceptual reliability, we construct paired inputs of degraded images and their original images and introduce an Implicit Perception Loss that constrains the model to ground its quality judgments in genuine visual evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Hawkeye outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes better across multiple datasets. The code and models will be made available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22920v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Large Language Models for Security Bug Report Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22921</link><description>arXiv:2601.22921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of security bug reports (SBRs) is critical for timely vulnerability mitigation. We present an evaluation of prompt-based engineering and fine-tuning approaches for predicting SBRs using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our findings reveal a distinct trade-off between the two approaches. Prompted proprietary models demonstrate the highest sensitivity to SBRs, achieving a G-measure of 77% and a recall of 74% on average across all the datasets, albeit at the cost of a higher false-positive rate, resulting in an average precision of only 22%. Fine-tuned models, by contrast, exhibit the opposite behavior, attaining a lower overall G-measure of 51% but substantially higher precision of 75% at the cost of reduced recall of 36%. Though a one-time investment in building fine-tuned models is necessary, the inference on the largest dataset is up to 50 times faster than that of proprietary models. These findings suggest that further investigations to harness the power of LLMs for SBR prediction are necessary.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22921v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BEAR: Towards Beam-Search-Aware Optimization for Recommendation with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22925</link><description>arXiv:2601.22925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a rapid surge in research leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation. These methods typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt LLMs to recommendation scenarios, and utilize beam search during inference to efficiently retrieve $B$ top-ranked recommended items. However, we identify a critical training-inference inconsistency: while SFT optimizes the overall probability of positive items, it does not guarantee that such items will be retrieved by beam search even if they possess high overall probabilities. Due to the greedy pruning mechanism, beam search can prematurely discard a positive item once its prefix probability is insufficient.
  To address this inconsistency, we propose BEAR (Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization), a novel fine-tuning objective that explicitly accounts for beam search behavior during training. Rather than directly simulating beam search for each instance during training, which is computationally prohibitive, BEAR enforces a relaxed necessary condition: each token in a positive item must rank within the top-$B$ candidate tokens at each decoding step. This objective effectively mitigates the risk of incorrect pruning while incurring negligible computational overhead compared to standard SFT. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Fully Autonomous Driving: AI, Challenges, Opportunities, and Needs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22927</link><description>arXiv:2601.22927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated driving (AD) is promising, but the transition to fully autonomous driving is, among other things, subject to the real, ever-changing open world and the resulting challenges. However, research in the field of AD demonstrates the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to outperform classical approaches, handle higher complexities, and reach a new level of autonomy. At the same time, the use of AI raises further questions of safety and transferability. To identify the challenges and opportunities arising from AI concerning autonomous driving functionalities, we have analyzed the current state of AD, outlined limitations, and identified foreseeable technological possibilities. Thereby, various further challenges are examined in the context of prospective developments. In this way, this article reconsiders fully autonomous driving with respect to advancements in the field of AI and carves out the respective needs and resulting research questions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22927v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMs Explain't: A Post-Mortem on Semantic Interpretability in Transformer Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22928</link><description>arXiv:2601.22928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in pervasive computing due to their versatility and strong performance. However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.
  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted. These limitations are particularly relevant in pervasive and distributed computing settings where LLMs are deployed as system components and interpretability methods are relied upon for debugging, compression, and explaining models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22928v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22929</link><description>arXiv:2601.22929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image embeddings are generally assumed to pose limited privacy risk. We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22929v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MTDrive: Multi-turn Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22930</link><description>arXiv:2601.22930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning is a core task in autonomous driving, requiring the prediction of safe and comfortable paths across diverse scenarios. Integrating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in addressing "long-tail" scenarios. However, existing methods are constrained to single-turn reasoning, limiting their ability to handle complex tasks requiring iterative refinement. To overcome this limitation, we present MTDrive, a multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to iteratively refine trajectories based on environmental feedback. MTDrive introduces Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (mtGRPO), which mitigates reward sparsity by computing relative advantages across turns. We further construct an interactive trajectory understanding dataset from closed-loop simulation to support multi-turn training. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our multi-turn reasoning paradigm. Additionally, we implement system-level optimizations to reduce data transfer overhead caused by high-resolution images and multi-turn sequences, achieving 2.5x training throughput.

Specifically, we identify two primary obstacles: (1) data scarcity, as high-quality parallel data requires bilingual annotators familiar with platform-specific slang, and stylistic cues in both languages; and (2) metric limitations, where traditional evaluators like COMET often fail to capture stylistic fidelity and nonstandard expressions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce CSM-MTBench, a benchmark covering five Chinese-foreign language directions and consisting of two expert-curated subsets: Fun Posts, featuring context-rich, slang- and neologism-heavy content, and Social Snippets, emphasizing concise, emotion- and style- driven expressions. Furthermore, we propose tailored evaluation approaches for each subset: measuring the translation success rate of slang and neologisms in Fun Posts, while assessing tone and style preservation in Social Snippets via a hybrid of embedding-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge. Experiments on over 20 models reveal substantial variation in how current MT systems handle semantic fidelity and informal, social-media-specific stylistic cues. CSM-MTBench thus serves as a rigorous testbed for advancing MT systems capable of mastering real-world Chinese social media texts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22931v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DC-LA: Difference-of-Convex Langevin Algorithm</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22932</link><description>arXiv:2601.22932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sampling problem whose target distribution is $\pi \propto \exp(-f-r)$ where the data fidelity term $f$ is Lipschitz smooth while the regularizer term $r=r_1-r_2$ is a non-smooth difference-of-convex (DC) function, i.e., $r_1,r_2$ are convex. By leveraging the DC structure of $r$, we can smooth out $r$ by applying Moreau envelopes to $r_1$ and $r_2$ separately. In line of DC programming, we then redistribute the concave part of the regularizer to the data fidelity and study its corresponding proximal Langevin algorithm (termed DC-LA). We establish convergence of DC-LA to the target distribution $\pi$, up to discretization and smoothing errors, in the $q$-Wasserstein distance for all $q \in \mathbb{N}^*$, under the assumption that $V$ is distant dissipative. Our results improve previous work on non-log-concave sampling in terms of a more general framework and assumptions. Numerical experiments show that DC-LA produces accurate distributions in synthetic settings and reliably provides uncertainty quantification in a real-world Computed Tomography application.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22932v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Protecting Private Code in IDE Autocomplete using Differential Privacy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22935</link><description>arXiv:2601.22935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) increasingly leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide advanced features like code autocomplete. While powerful, training these models on user-written code introduces significant privacy risks, making the models themselves a new type of data vulnerability. Malicious actors can exploit this by launching attacks to reconstruct sensitive training data or infer whether a specific code snippet was used for training. This paper investigates the use of Differential Privacy (DP) as a robust defense mechanism for training an LLM for Kotlin code completion. We fine-tune a \texttt{Mellum} model using DP and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its privacy and utility. Our results demonstrate that DP provides a strong defense against Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), reducing the attack's success rate close to a random guess (AUC from 0.901 to 0.606). Furthermore, we show that this privacy guarantee comes at a minimal cost to model performance, with the DP-trained model achieving utility scores comparable to its non-private counterpart, even when trained on 100x less data. Our findings suggest that DP is a practical and effective solution for building private and trustworthy AI-powered IDE features.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22935v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Real-Time Privacy-Preserving Behavior Recognition System via Edge-Cloud Collaboration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22938</link><description>arXiv:2601.22938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As intelligent sensing expands into high-privacy environments such as restrooms and changing rooms, the field faces a critical privacy-security paradox. Traditional RGB surveillance raises significant concerns regarding visual recording and storage, while existing privacy-preserving methods-ranging from physical desensitization to traditional cryptographic or obfuscation techniques-often compromise semantic understanding capabilities or fail to guarantee mathematical irreversibility against reconstruction attacks. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel privacy-preserving perception technology based on the AI Flow theoretical framework and an edge-cloud collaborative architecture. The proposed methodology integrates source desensitization with irreversible feature mapping. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, the edge device performs millisecond-level processing to transform raw imagery into abstract feature vectors via non-linear mapping and stochastic noise injection. This process constructs a unidirectional information flow that strips identity-sensitive attributes, rendering the reconstruction of original images impossible. Subsequently, the cloud platform utilizes multimodal family models to perform joint inference solely on these abstract vectors to detect abnormal behaviors. This approach fundamentally severs the path to privacy leakage at the architectural level, achieving a breakthrough from video surveillance to de-identified behavior perception and offering a robust solution for risk management in high-sensitivity public spaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FNWoS: Fractional Neural Walk-on-Spheres Methods for High-Dimensional PDEs Driven by $\alpha$-stable L\'{e}vy Process on Irregular Domains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22942</link><description>arXiv:2601.22942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a highly parallel and derivative-free fractional neural walk-on-spheres method (FNWoS) for solving high-dimensional fractional Poisson equations on irregular domains. We first propose a simplified fractional walk-on-spheres (FWoS) scheme that replaces the high-dimensional normalized weight integral with a constant weight and adopts a correspondingly simpler sampling density, substantially reducing per-trajectory cost. To mitigate the slow convergence of standard Monte Carlo sampling, FNWoS is then proposed via integrating this simplified FWoS estimator, derived from the Feynman-Kac representation, with a neural network surrogate. By amortizing sampling effort over the entire domain during training, FNWoS achieves more accurate evaluation at arbitrary query points with dramatically fewer trajectories than classical FWoS. To further enhance efficiency in regimes where the fractional order $\alpha$ is close to 2 and trajectories become excessively long, we introduce a truncated path strategy with a prescribed maximum step count. Building on this, we propose a buffered supervision mechanism that caches training pairs and progressively refines their Monte Carlo targets during training, removing the need to precompute a highly accurate training set and yielding the buffered fractional neural walk-on-spheres method (BFNWoS). Extensive numerical experiments, including tests on irregular domains and problems with dimensions up to $1000$, demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency of the proposed methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22942v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Topology-Preserving Graph Coarsening with Graph Collapse</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22943</link><description>arXiv:2601.22943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph coarsening reduces the size of a graph while preserving certain properties. Most existing methods preserve either spectral or spatial characteristics. Recent research has shown that preserving topological features helps maintain the predictive performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on the coarsened graph but suffers from exponential time complexity. To address these problems, we propose Scalable Topology-Preserving Graph Coarsening (STPGC) by introducing the concepts of graph strong collapse and graph edge collapse extended from algebraic topology. STPGC comprises three new algorithms, GStrongCollapse, GEdgeCollapse, and NeighborhoodConing based on these two concepts, which eliminate dominated nodes and edges while rigorously preserving topological features. We further prove that STPGC preserves the GNN receptive field and develop approximate algorithms to accelerate GNN training. Experiments on node classification with GNNs demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of STPGC.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22944</link><description>arXiv:2601.22944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains challenging when models simultaneously encounter correlation shifts across environments and diversity shifts driven by rare or hard samples. Existing invariant risk minimization (IRM) methods primarily address spurious correlations at the environment level, but often overlook sample-level heterogeneity within environments, which can critically impact OOD performance. In this work, we propose \emph{Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization} (ECTR), a unified framework that augments TV-based invariant learning with environment-conditioned tail reweighting to jointly address both types of distribution shift. By integrating environment-level invariance with within-environment robustness, the proposed approach makes these two mechanisms complementary under mixed distribution shifts. We further extend the framework to scenarios without explicit environment annotations by inferring latent environments through a minimax formulation. Experiments across regression, tabular, time-series, and image classification benchmarks under mixed distribution shifts demonstrate consistent improvements in both worst-environment and average OOD performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22944v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Data Leak to Secret Misses: The Impact of Data Leakage on Secret Detection Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22946</link><description>arXiv:2601.22946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used for software security tasks. These models are commonly trained and evaluated on large Internet-derived datasets, which often contain duplicated or highly similar samples. When such samples are split across training and test sets, data leakage may occur, allowing models to memorize patterns instead of learning to generalize. We investigate duplication in a widely used benchmark dataset of hard coded secrets and show how data leakage can substantially inflate the reported performance of AI-based secret detectors, resulting in a misleading picture of their real-world effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22946v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Relaxing Positional Alignment in Masked Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22947</link><description>arXiv:2601.22947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to dominant autoregressive approaches. Although they achieve competitive performance on several tasks, a substantial gap remains in open-ended text generation. We hypothesize that one cause of this gap is that strict positional prediction makes MDLM decoding highly sensitive to token misalignment, and we show through controlled interventions that a one-position shift can severely disrupt semantics. This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a special token  via the connectionist temporal classification objective. We apply this approach to the widely used MDLM model and conduct experiments on five open-ended text generation benchmarks. Our method consistently outperforms the original model and improves robustness to positional shifts, indicating that relaxing strict positional supervision is an important factor in improving generation quality in MDLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22947v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Alignment among Language, Vision and Action Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22948</link><description>arXiv:2601.22948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science and AI concerns whether different learning modalities: language, vision, and action, give rise to distinct or shared internal representations. Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22948v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autonomous Chain-of-Thought Distillation for Graph-Based Fraud Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22949</link><description>arXiv:2601.22949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based fraud detection on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) requires jointly modeling rich textual semantics and relational dependencies. However, existing LLM-enhanced GNN approaches are constrained by predefined prompting and decoupled training pipelines, limiting reasoning autonomy and weakening semantic-structural alignment. We propose FraudCoT, a unified framework that advances TAG-based fraud detection through autonomous, graph-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and scalable LLM-GNN co-training. To address the limitations of predefined prompts, we introduce a fraud-aware selective CoT distillation mechanism that generates diverse reasoning paths and enhances semantic-structural understanding. These distilled CoTs are integrated into node texts, providing GNNs with enriched, multi-hop semantic and structural cues for fraud detection. Furthermore, we develop an efficient asymmetric co-training strategy that enables end-to-end optimization while significantly reducing the computational cost of naive joint training. Extensive experiments on public and industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FraudCoT achieves up to 8.8% AUPRC improvement over state-of-the-art methods and delivers up to 1,066x speedup in training throughput, substantially advancing both detection performance and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22949v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Perplexity Cannot Always Tell Right from Wrong</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22950</link><description>arXiv:2601.22950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perplexity -- a function measuring a model's overall level of "surprise" when encountering a particular output -- has gained significant traction in recent years, both as a loss function and as a simple-to-compute metric of model quality. Prior studies have pointed out several limitations of perplexity, often from an empirical manner. Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22950v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sifting the Noise: A Comparative Study of LLM Agents in Vulnerability False Positive Filtering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22952</link><description>arXiv:2601.22952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are essential for identifying software vulnerabilities, but they often produce a high volume of false positives (FPs), imposing a substantial manual triage burden on developers. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a promising direction by enabling iterative reasoning, tool use, and environment interaction to refine SAST alerts. However, the comparative effectiveness of different LLM-based agent architectures for FP filtering remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a comparative study of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agent frameworks, i.e., Aider, OpenHands, and SWE-agent, for vulnerability FP filtering. We evaluate these frameworks using the vulnerabilities from the OWASP Benchmark and real-world open-source Java projects. The experimental results show that LLM-based agents can remove the majority of SAST noise, reducing an initial FP detection rate of over 92% on the OWASP Benchmark to as low as 6.3% in the best configuration. On real-world dataset, the best configuration of LLM-based agents can achieve an FP identification rate of up to 93.3% involving CodeQL alerts. However, the benefits of agents are strongly backbone- and CWE-dependent: agentic frameworks significantly outperform vanilla prompting for stronger models such as Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5, but yield limited or inconsistent gains for weaker backbones. Moreover, aggressive FP reduction can come at the cost of suppressing true vulnerabilities, highlighting important trade-offs. Finally, we observe large disparities in computational cost across agent frameworks. Overall, our study demonstrates that LLM-based agents are a powerful but non-uniform solution for SAST FP filtering, and that their practical deployment requires careful consideration of agent design, backbone model choice, vulnerability category, and operational cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22952v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Residual Context Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22954</link><description>arXiv:2601.22954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to purely autoregressive language models because they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, state-of-the-art block-wise dLLMs rely on a "remasking" mechanism that decodes only the most confident tokens and discards the rest, effectively wasting computation. We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22954v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SWE-Manager: Selecting and Synthesizing Golden Proposals Before Coding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22956</link><description>arXiv:2601.22956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) research in software engineering has largely focused on tasks such as code generation and bug repair. In practice, teams often draft multiple candidate proposals for fixing an issue and then deliberate on one golden proposal for implementation. This selection requires not only assessing the issue's scope, impact, and urgency, but also a clear understanding of each proposal's strengths and weaknesses. A good selection could make issue resolution more reliable while reducing regression and operational risk, whereas a poor choice can increase risk and even cause unpredictable failures.
  We first conduct a manual study of real-world issues to characterize the rationales maintainers use when selecting among competing proposals. Motivated by these findings, we introduce SWE-Manager, a joint selection and synthesis approach that selects the best proposal and synthesizes a golden proposal. SWE-Manager is an 8B model trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to compare proposals, justify its choice, and synthesize a golden proposal for implementation. We view proposal selection as a reasoning task, mirroring how technical managers review competing proposals by weighing issue context and each proposal's solution without executing code or running tests. On the SWE-Lancer Manager benchmark, SWE-Manager achieves 53.21 selection accuracy and 57.75 earn rate, earning 152,750 dollars and outperforming strong baselines including GPT-5. To further evaluate the effectiveness of SWE-Manager in real-world issue resolution, we design the P2A framework, which simulates a real-world workflow where multiple proposals are drafted, reviewed, and a golden proposal is selected for implementation ...</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22956v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Triage: Hierarchical Visual Budgeting for Efficient Video Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22959</link><description>arXiv:2601.22959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face significant computational challenges in video processing due to massive data redundancy, which creates prohibitively long token sequences. To address this, we introduce Triage, a training-free, plug-and-play framework that reframes video reasoning as a resource allocation problem via hierarchical visual budgeting. Its first stage, Frame-Level Budgeting, identifies keyframes by evaluating their visual dynamics and relevance, generating a strategic prior based on their importance scores. Guided by this prior, the second stage, Token-Level Budgeting, allocates tokens in two phases: it first secures high-relevance Core Tokens, followed by diverse Context Tokens selected with an efficient batched Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Triage improves inference speed and reduces memory footprint, while maintaining or surpassing the performance of baselines and other methods on various video reasoning benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Supervised Machine Learning Performance in Optical Quality Control via Generative AI for Dataset Expansion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22961</link><description>arXiv:2601.22961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in optical quality control within industrial production. These approaches require representative datasets for effective model training. However, while non-defective components are frequent, defective parts are rare in production, resulting in highly imbalanced datasets that adversely impact model performance. Existing strategies to address this challenge, such as specialized loss functions or traditional data augmentation techniques, have limitations, including the need for careful hyperparameter tuning or the alteration of only simple image features. Therefore, this work explores the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) as an alternative method for expanding limited datasets and enhancing supervised machine learning performance. Specifically, we investigate Stable Diffusion and CycleGAN as image generation models, focusing on the segmentation of combine harvester components in thermal images for subsequent defect detection. Our results demonstrate that dataset expansion using Stable Diffusion yields the most significant improvement, enhancing segmentation performance by 4.6 %, resulting in a Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU) of 84.6 %.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22961v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EvoClinician: A Self-Evolving Agent for Multi-Turn Medical Diagnosis via Test-Time Evolutionary Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22964</link><description>arXiv:2601.22964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing medical AI operates on an unrealistic ''one-shot'' model, diagnosing from a complete patient file. However, real-world diagnosis is an iterative inquiry where Clinicians sequentially ask questions and order tests to strategically gather information while managing cost and time. To address this, we first propose Med-Inquire, a new benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to perform multi-turn diagnosis. Built upon a dataset of real-world clinical cases, Med-Inquire simulates the diagnostic process by hiding a complete patient file behind specialized Patient and Examination agents. They force the agent to proactively ask questions and order tests to gather information piece by piece. To tackle the challenges posed by Med-Inquire, we then introduce EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that learns efficient diagnostic strategies at test time. Its core is a ''Diagnose-Grade-Evolve'' loop: an Actor agent attempts a diagnosis; a Process Grader agent performs credit assignment by evaluating each action for both clinical yield and resource efficiency; finally, an Evolver agent uses this feedback to update the Actor's strategy by evolving its prompt and memory. Our experiments show EvoClinician outperforms continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents like memory agents.

Abstract: Diffusion policies (DP) have demonstrated significant potential in visual navigation by capturing diverse multi-modal trajectory distributions. However, standard imitation learning (IL), which most DP methods rely on for training, often inherits sub-optimality and redundancy from expert demonstrations, thereby necessitating a computationally intensive "generate-then-filter" pipeline that relies on auxiliary selectors during inference. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy (SIDP), a novel framework that learns improved planning by selectively imitating a set of trajectories sampled from itself. Specifically, SIDP introduces a reward-guided self-imitation mechanism that encourages the policy to consistently produce high-quality trajectories efficiently, rather than outputs of inconsistent quality, thereby reducing reliance on extensive sampling and post-filtering. During training, we employ a reward-driven curriculum learning paradigm to mitigate inefficient data utility, and goal-agnostic exploration for trajectory augmentation to improve planning robustness. Extensive evaluations on a comprehensive simulation benchmark show that SIDP significantly outperforms previous methods, with real-world experiments confirming its effectiveness across multiple robotic platforms. On Jetson Orin Nano, SIDP delivers a 2.5$\times$ faster inference than the baseline NavDP, i.e., 110ms VS 273ms, enabling efficient real-time deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22965v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified View of Attention and Residual Sinks: Outlier-Driven Rescaling is Essential for Transformer Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22966</link><description>arXiv:2601.22966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the functional role of emergent outliers in large language models, specifically attention sinks (a few tokens that consistently receive large attention logits) and residual sinks (a few fixed dimensions with persistently large activations across most tokens). We hypothesize that these outliers, in conjunction with the corresponding normalizations (\textit{e.g.}, softmax attention and RMSNorm), effectively rescale other non-outlier components. We term this phenomenon \textit{outlier-driven rescaling} and validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and training token counts. This view unifies the origin and mitigation of both sink types. Our main conclusions and observations include: (1) Outliers function jointly with normalization: removing normalization eliminates the corresponding outliers but degrades training stability and performance; directly clipping outliers while retaining normalization leads to degradation, indicating that outlier-driven rescaling contributes to training stability. (2) Outliers serve more as rescale factors rather than contributors, as the final contributions of attention and residual sinks are significantly smaller than those of non-outliers. (3) Outliers can be absorbed into learnable parameters or mitigated via explicit gated rescaling, leading to improved training performance (average gain of 2 points) and enhanced quantization robustness (1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22966v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improved Algorithms for Nash Welfare in Linear Bandits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22969</link><description>arXiv:2601.22969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nash regret has recently emerged as a principled fairness-aware performance metric for stochastic multi-armed bandits, motivated by the Nash Social Welfare objective. Although this notion has been extended to linear bandits, existing results suffer from suboptimality in ambient dimension $d$, stemming from proof techniques that rely on restrictive concentration inequalities. In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$. Extensive experiments on linear bandit instances generated from real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform the existing state-of-the-art baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22969v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stabilizing the Q-Gradient Field for Policy Smoothness in Actor-Critic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22970</link><description>arXiv:2601.22970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policies learned via continuous actor-critic methods often exhibit erratic, high-frequency oscillations, making them unsuitable for physical deployment. Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22970v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MiTa: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework with Memory-integrated and Task Allocation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22974</link><description>arXiv:2601.22974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have substantially accelerated the development of embodied agents. LLM-based multi-agent systems mitigate the inefficiency of single agents in complex tasks. However, they still suffer from issues such as memory inconsistency and agent behavioral conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MiTa, a hierarchical memory-integrated task allocative framework to enhance collaborative efficiency. MiTa organizes agents into a manager-member hierarchy, where the manager incorporates additional allocation and summary modules that enable (1) global task allocation and (2) episodic memory integration. The allocation module enables the manager to allocate tasks from a global perspective, thereby avoiding potential inter-agent conflicts. The summary module, triggered by task progress updates, performs episodic memory integration by condensing recent collaboration history into a concise summary that preserves long-horizon context. By combining task allocation with episodic memory, MiTa attains a clearer understanding of the task and facilitates globally consistent task distribution. Experimental results confirm that MiTa achieves superior efficiency and adaptability in complex multi-agent cooperation over strong baseline methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22974v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Golden Goose: A Simple Trick to Synthesize Unlimited RLVR Tasks from Unverifiable Internet Text</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22975</link><description>arXiv:2601.22975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a cornerstone for unlocking complex reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, scaling up RL is bottlenecked by limited existing verifiable data, where improvements increasingly saturate over prolonged training. To overcome this, we propose Golden Goose, a simple trick to synthesize unlimited RLVR tasks from unverifiable internet text by constructing a multiple-choice question-answering version of the fill-in-the-middle task. Given a source text, we prompt an LLM to identify and mask key reasoning steps, then generate a set of diverse, plausible distractors. This enables us to leverage reasoning-rich unverifiable corpora typically excluded from prior RLVR data construction (e.g., science textbooks) to synthesize GooseReason-0.7M, a large-scale RLVR dataset with over 0.7 million tasks spanning mathematics, programming, and general scientific domains. Empirically, GooseReason effectively revives models saturated on existing RLVR data, yielding robust, sustained gains under continuous RL and achieving new state-of-the-art results for 1.5B and 4B-Instruct models across 15 diverse benchmarks. Finally, we deploy Golden Goose in a real-world setting, synthesizing RLVR tasks from raw FineWeb scrapes for the cybersecurity domain, where no prior RLVR data exists. Training Qwen3-4B-Instruct on the resulting data GooseReason-Cyber sets a new state-of-the-art in cybersecurity, surpassing a 7B domain-specialized model with extensive domain-specific pre-training and post-training. This highlights the potential of automatically scaling up RLVR data by exploiting abundant, reasoning-rich, unverifiable internet text.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22975v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantifying Model Uniqueness in Heterogeneous AI Ecosystems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22977</link><description>arXiv:2601.22977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems evolve from isolated predictors into complex, heterogeneous ecosystems of foundation models and specialized adapters, distinguishing genuine behavioral novelty from functional redundancy becomes a critical governance challenge. Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($d\sigma^2\gamma^{-2}\log(Nd/\delta)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters. These results move trustworthy AI beyond explaining single models: they establish a principled, intervention-based science of auditing and governing heterogeneous model ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22977v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learnable Permutation for Structured Sparsity on Transformer Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22980</link><description>arXiv:2601.22980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured sparsity has emerged as a popular model pruning technique, widely adopted in various architectures, including CNNs, Transformer models, and especially large language models (LLMs) in recent years. A promising direction to further improve post-pruning performance is weight permutation, which reorders model weights into patterns more amenable to pruning. However, the exponential growth of the permutation search space with the scale of Transformer architectures forces most methods to rely on greedy or heuristic algorithms, limiting the effectiveness of reordering.
  In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable permutation framework. Our method introduces a learnable permutation cost matrix to quantify the cost of swapping any two input channels of a given weight matrix, a differentiable bipartite matching solver to obtain the optimal binary permutation matrix given a cost matrix, and a sparsity optimization loss function to directly optimize the permutation operator. We extensively validate our approach on vision and language Transformers, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art permutation results for structured sparsity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22980v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] About an Automating Annotation Method for Robot Markers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22982</link><description>arXiv:2601.22982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factory automation has become increasingly important due to labor shortages, leading to the introduction of autonomous mobile robots for tasks such as material transportation. Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus. Automatic annotation also reduces human effort and ensures consistent labeling quality. Future work will investigate the relationship between confidence thresholds and recognition performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22982v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why Your Deep Research Agent Fails?

Abstract: Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization.

Abstract: We propose dgMARK, a decoding-guided watermarking method for discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs). Unlike autoregressive models, dLLMs can generate tokens in arbitrary order. While an ideal conditional predictor would be invariant to this order, practical dLLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to the unmasking order, creating a new channel for watermarking. dgMARK steers the unmasking order toward positions whose high-reward candidate tokens satisfy a simple parity constraint induced by a binary hash, without explicitly reweighting the model's learned probabilities. The method is plug-and-play with common decoding strategies (e.g., confidence, entropy, and margin-based ordering) and can be strengthened with a one-step lookahead variant. Watermarks are detected via elevated parity-matching statistics, and a sliding-window detector ensures robustness under post-editing operations including insertion, deletion, substitution, and paraphrasing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22985v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ArabicDialectHub: A Cross-Dialectal Arabic Learning Resource and Platform</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22987</link><description>arXiv:2601.22987v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation demands visuomotor policies capable of robust spatial scene understanding and strong generalization across diverse camera viewpoints. While recent advances in 3D-aware visual representations have shown promise, they still suffer from several key limitations, including reliance on multi-view observations during inference which is impractical in single-view restricted scenarios, incomplete scene modeling that fails to capture holistic and fine-grained geometric structures essential for precise manipulation, and lack of effective policy training strategies to retain and exploit the acquired 3D knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MethodName, a unified representation-policy learning framework for view-generalizable robotic manipulation. MethodName introduces a single-view 3D pretraining paradigm that leverages point cloud reconstruction and feed-forward gaussian splatting under multi-view supervision to learn holistic geometric representations. During policy learning, MethodName performs multi-step distillation to preserve the pretrained geometric understanding and effectively transfer it to manipulation skills. We conduct experiments on 12 RLBench tasks, where our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 12.7% in average success rate. Further evaluation on six representative tasks demonstrates strong zero-shot view generalization, with success rate drops of only 22.0% and 29.7% under moderate and large viewpoint shifts respectively, whereas the state-of-the-art method suffers larger decreases of 41.6% and 51.5%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22988v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Supervised Slice-to-Volume Reconstruction with Gaussian Representations for Fetal MRI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22990</link><description>arXiv:2601.22990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D fetal MR volumes from motion-corrupted stacks of 2D slices is a crucial and challenging task. Conventional slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods are time-consuming and require multiple orthogonal stacks for reconstruction. While learning-based SVR approaches have significantly reduced the time required at the inference stage, they heavily rely on ground truth information for training, which is inaccessible in practice. To address these challenges, we propose GaussianSVR, a self-supervised framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. GaussianSVR represents the target volume using 3D Gaussian representations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. It leverages a simulated forward slice acquisition model to enable self-supervised training, alleviating the need for ground-truth volumes. Furthermore, to enhance both accuracy and efficiency, we introduce a multi-resolution training strategy that jointly optimizes Gaussian parameters and spatial transformations across different resolution levels. Experiments show that GaussianSVR outperforms the baseline methods on fetal MR volumetric reconstruction. Code will be available upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22990v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Value-at-Risk Constrained Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22993</link><description>arXiv:2601.22993v1 Announce Type: new

Empirically, we demonstrate that VaR-CPO is capable of safe exploration, achieving zero constraint violations during training in feasible environments, a critical property that baseline methods fail to uphold. To overcome the inherent non-differentiability of the VaR constraint, we employ the one-sided Chebyshev inequality to obtain a tractable surrogate based on the first two moments of the cost return. Additionally, by extending the trust-region framework of the Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO) method, we provide rigorous worst-case bounds for both policy improvement and constraint violation during the training process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22993v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Competitive Non-Clairvoyant KV-Cache Scheduling for LLM Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22996</link><description>arXiv:2601.22996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference presents a unique scheduling challenge due to the Key-Value (KV) cache, where a job's memory footprint grows linearly with the number of decoded tokens. This growth couples scheduling decisions with feasibility: a scheduler must minimize latency under a hard memory budget, yet the response lengths of requests are inherently unknown. While recent works have explored this problem either assuming clairvoyance -- exact knowledge of response lengths -- or relying on machine-learned predictions, obtaining robust performance guarantees without any prior knowledge of job sizes remains a theoretically fundamental and practically important open problem.
  In this work, we propose the Geometric Slicing Algorithm (GSA), the non-clairvoyant policy to achieve the first constant competitive ratio for this problem in the offline batch setting. GSA manages uncertainty through a geometric phase structure that periodically restarts jobs to bound memory exposure, combined with a staggered pipeline mechanism that enables high concurrency by smoothing aggregate memory consumption. We prove that GSA achieves a competitive ratio of at most 61.92 for general instances, improving to 32 in the large-memory regime. Our algorithmic framework also yields a clairvoyant counterpart, the Geometric Batching Algorithm (GBA), which achieves an approximation ratio of 10.67 for general instances and 6.75 in the large-memory regime -- significantly improving upon the best previously known bound of over 9000. Numerical experiments on real request traces demonstrate that our algorithms perform robustly while preserving these worst-case guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22996v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mano: Restriking Manifold Optimization for LLM Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23000</link><description>arXiv:2601.23000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, the hardware and computational costs for training LLMs are also significantly burdensome. Among the state-of-the-art optimizers, AdamW relies on diagonal curvature estimates and ignores structural properties, while Muon applies global spectral normalization at the expense of losing curvature information. In this study, we restriked manifold optimization methods for training LLMs, which may address both optimizers' limitations, while conventional manifold optimization methods have been largely overlooked due to the poor performance in large-scale model optimization. By innovatively projecting the momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constraining it on a rotational Oblique manifold, we propose a novel, powerful, and efficient optimizer **Mano** that is the first to bridge the performance gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen3 models demonstrate that Mano consistently and significantly outperforms AdamW and Muon even with less memory consumption and computational complexity, respectively, suggesting an expanded Pareto frontier in terms of space and time efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23000v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bias Beyond Borders: Political Ideology Evaluation and Steering in Multilingual LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23001</link><description>arXiv:2601.23001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape global discourse, making fairness and ideological neutrality essential for responsible AI deployment. Despite growing attention to political bias in LLMs, prior work largely focuses on high-resource, Western languages or narrow multilingual settings, leaving cross-lingual consistency and safe post-hoc mitigation underexplored. To address this gap, we present a large-scale multilingual evaluation of political bias spanning 50 countries and 33 languages. We introduce a complementary post-hoc mitigation framework, Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS), designed to augment existing steering methods by aligning ideological representations across languages and dynamically regulating intervention strength. This method aligns latent ideological representations induced by political prompts into a shared ideological subspace, ensuring cross lingual consistency, with the adaptive mechanism prevents over correction and preserves coherence. Experiments demonstrate substantial bias reduction along both economic and social axes with minimal degradation in response quality. The proposed framework establishes a scalable and interpretable paradigm for fairness-aware multilingual LLM governance, balancing ideological neutrality with linguistic and cultural diversity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] InstructDiff: Domain-Adaptive Data Selection via Differential Entropy for Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23006</link><description>arXiv:2601.23006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is fundamental to adapting large language models, yet training on complete datasets incurs prohibitive costs with diminishing returns. Existing data selection methods suffer from severe domain specificity: techniques optimized for general instruction-following fail on reasoning tasks, and vice versa. We observe that measuring entropy differences between base models and minimally instruction-tuned calibrated models reveals a pattern -- samples with the lowest differential entropy consistently yield optimal performance across domains, yet this principle manifests domain-adaptively: reasoning tasks favor entropy increase (cognitive expansion), while general tasks favor entropy decrease (cognitive compression). We introduce InstructDiff, a unified framework that operationalizes differential entropy as a domain-adaptive selection criterion through warmup calibration, bi-directional NLL filtering, and entropy-based ranking. Extensive experiments show that InstructDiff achieves 17\% relative improvement over full data training on mathematical reasoning and 52\% for general instruction-following, outperforming prior baselines while using only 10\% of the data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23006v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging Multi-Rater Annotations to Calibrate Object Detectors in Microscopy Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23007</link><description>arXiv:2601.23007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based object detectors have achieved impressive performance in microscopy imaging, yet their confidence estimates often lack calibration, limiting their reliability for biomedical applications. In this work, we introduce a new approach to improve model calibration by leveraging multi-rater annotations. We propose to train separate models on the annotations from single experts and aggregate their predictions to emulate consensus. This improves upon label sampling strategies, where models are trained on mixed annotations, and offers a more principled way to capture inter-rater variability. Experiments on a colorectal organoid dataset annotated by two experts demonstrate that our rater-specific ensemble strategy improves calibration performance while maintaining comparable detection accuracy. These findings suggest that explicitly modelling rater disagreement can lead to more trustworthy object detectors in biomedical imaging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SolAgent: A Specialized Multi-Agent Framework for Solidity Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23009</link><description>arXiv:2601.23009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart contracts are the backbone of the decentralized web, yet ensuring their functional correctness and security remains a critical challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, they often struggle with the rigorous requirements of smart contracts, frequently producing code that is buggy or vulnerable. To address this, we propose SolAgent, a novel tool-augmented multi-agent framework that mimics the workflow of human experts. SolAgent integrates a \textbf{dual-loop refinement mechanism}: an inner loop using the \textit{Forge} compiler to ensure functional correctness, and an outer loop leveraging the \textit{Slither} static analyzer to eliminate security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the agent is equipped with file system capabilities to resolve complex project dependencies. Experiments on the SolEval+ Benchmark, a rigorous suite derived from high-quality real-world projects, demonstrate that SolAgent achieves a Pass@1 rate of up to \textbf{64.39\%}, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs ($\sim$25\%), AI IDEs (e.g., GitHub Copilot), and existing agent frameworks. Moreover, it reduces security vulnerabilities by up to \textbf{39.77\%} compared to human-written baselines. Finally, we demonstrate that the high-quality trajectories generated by SolAgent can be used to distill smaller, open-source models, democratizing access to secure smart contract generation.

Abstract: Reliable control of myoelectric prostheses is often hindered by high inter-subject variability and the clinical impracticality of high-density sensor arrays. This study proposes a deep learning framework for accurate gesture recognition using only two surface electromyography (sEMG) channels. The method employs a Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) to extract temporal feature representations directly from raw signals, eliminating the need for heuristic feature engineering. On a 6-class gesture set, our model achieved a multi-subject F1-score of 94.3% $\pm$ 0.3%. To address subject-specific differences, we present a few-shot transfer learning protocol that improved performance on unseen subjects from a baseline of 35.1% $\pm$ 3.1% to 92.3% $\pm$ 0.9% with minimal calibration data. Furthermore, the system supports functional extensibility through an incremental learning strategy, allowing for expansion to a 10-class set with a 90.0% $\pm$ 0.2% F1-score without full model retraining. By combining high precision with minimal computational and sensor overhead, this framework provides a scalable and efficient approach for the next generation of affordable and adaptive prosthetic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23011v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mem-T: Densifying Rewards for Long-Horizon Memory Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23014</link><description>arXiv:2601.23014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory agents, which depart from predefined memory-processing pipelines by endogenously managing the processing, storage, and retrieval of memories, have garnered increasing attention for their autonomy and adaptability. However, existing training paradigms remain constrained: agents often traverse long-horizon sequences of memory operations before receiving sparse and delayed rewards, which hinders truly end-to-end optimization of memory management policies. To address this limitation, we introduce Mem-T, an autonomous memory agent that interfaces with a lightweight hierarchical memory database to perform dynamic updates and multi-turn retrieval over streaming inputs. To effectively train long-horizon memory management capabilities, we further propose MoT-GRPO, a tree-guided reinforcement learning framework that transforms sparse terminal feedback into dense, step-wise supervision via memory operation tree backpropagation and hindsight credit assignment, thereby enabling the joint optimization of memory construction and retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mem-T is (1) high-performing, surpassing frameworks such as A-Mem and Mem0 by up to $14.92\%$, and (2) economical, operating on a favorable accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier and reducing inference tokens per query by $\sim24.45\%$ relative to GAM without sacrificing performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Integrating Multi-Label Classification and Generative AI for Scalable Analysis of User Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23018</link><description>arXiv:2601.23018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In highly competitive software markets, user experience (UX) evaluation is crucial for ensuring software quality and fostering long-term product success. Such UX evaluations typically combine quantitative metrics from standardized questionnaires with qualitative feedback collected through open-ended questions. While open-ended feedback offers valuable insights for improvement and helps explain quantitative results, analyzing large volumes of user comments is challenging and time-consuming. In this paper, we present techniques developed during a long-term UX measurement project at a major software company to efficiently process and interpret extensive volumes of user comments. To provide a high-level overview of the collected comments, we employ a supervised machine learning approach that assigns meaningful, pre-defined topic labels to each comment. Additionally, we demonstrate how generative AI (GenAI) can be leveraged to create concise and informative summaries of user feedback, facilitating effective communication of findings to the organization and especially upper management. Finally, we investigate whether the sentiment expressed in user comments can serve as an indicator for overall product satisfaction. Our results show that sentiment analysis alone does not reliably reflect user satisfaction. Instead, product satisfaction needs to be assessed explicitly in surveys to measure the user's perception of the product.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncovering Hidden Inclusions of Vulnerable Dependencies in Real-World Java Projects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23020</link><description>arXiv:2601.23020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) dependencies are a dominant component of modern software code bases. Using proven and well-tested OSS components lets developers reduce development time and cost while improving quality. However, heavy reliance on open-source software also introduces significant security risks, including the incorporation of known vulnerabilities into the codebase. To mitigate these risks, metadata-based dependency scanners, which are lightweight and fast, and code-centric scanners, which enable the detection of modified dependencies hidden from metadata-based approaches, have been developed. In this paper, we present Unshade, a hybrid approach towards dependency scanning in Java that combines the efficiency of metadata-based scanning with the ability to detect modified dependencies of code-centric approaches. Unshade first augments a Java project's software bill of materials (SBOM) by identifying modified and hidden dependencies via a bytecode-based fingerprinting mechanism. This augmented SBOM is then passed to a metadata-based vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities in both declared and newly revealed dependencies. Leveraging Unshade's high scalability, we conducted a large-scale study of the 1,808 most popular open-source Java Maven projects on GitHub. The results show that nearly 50% of these projects contain at least one modified, hidden dependency associated with a known vulnerability. On average, each affected project includes more than eight such hidden vulnerable dependencies, all missed by traditional metadata-based scanners. Overall, Unshade identified 7,712 unique CVEs in hidden dependencies that would remain undetected when relying on metadata-based scanning alone.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23020v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DimABSA: Building Multilingual and Multidomain Datasets for Dimensional Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23022</link><description>arXiv:2601.23022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) focuses on extracting sentiment at a fine-grained aspect level and has been widely applied across real-world domains. However, existing ABSA research relies on coarse-grained categorical labels (e.g., positive, negative), which limits its ability to capture nuanced affective states. To address this limitation, we adopt a dimensional approach that represents sentiment with continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores, enabling fine-grained analysis at both the aspect and sentiment levels. To this end, we introduce DimABSA, the first multilingual, dimensional ABSA resource annotated with both traditional ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, and opinion terms) and newly introduced VA scores. This resource contains 76,958 aspect instances across 42,590 sentences, spanning six languages and four domains. We further introduce three subtasks that combine VA scores with different ABSA elements, providing a bridge from traditional ABSA to dimensional ABSA. Given that these subtasks involve both categorical and continuous outputs, we propose a new unified metric, continuous F1 (cF1), which incorporates VA prediction error into standard F1. We provide a comprehensive benchmark using both prompted and fine-tuned large language models across all subtasks. Our results show that DimABSA is a challenging benchmark and provides a foundation for advancing multilingual dimensional ABSA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23022v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Characterization of Measurement and Mechanistic Anomalies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23026</link><description>arXiv:2601.23026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Root cause analysis of anomalies aims to identify those features that cause the deviation from the normal process. Existing methods ignore, however, that anomalies can arise through two fundamentally different processes: measurement errors, where data was generated normally but one or more values were recorded incorrectly, and mechanism shifts, where the causal process generating the data changed. While measurement errors can often be safely corrected, mechanistic anomalies require careful consideration. We define a causal model that explicitly captures both types by treating outliers as latent interventions on latent ("true") and observed ("measured") variables. We show that they are identifiable, and propose a maximum likelihood estimation approach to put this to practice. Experiments show that our method matches state-of-the-art performance in root cause localization, while it additionally enables accurate classification of anomaly types, and remains robust even when the causal DAG is unknown.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Divide-and-Conquer CoT: RL for Reducing Latency via Parallel Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23027</link><description>arXiv:2601.23027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long chain-of-thought reasoning (Long CoT) is now fundamental to state-of-the-art LLMs, especially in mathematical reasoning. However, LLM generation is highly sequential, and long CoTs lead to a high latency. We propose to train Divide-and-Conquer CoT (DC-CoT) to reduce the latency. With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%. Our code, SFT dataset and models are publicly available at https://github.com/amahankali10/DC_CoT_RL_for_Low_Latency_CoT_with_Parallel_Reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23027v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Guided by Trajectories: Repairing and Rewarding Tool-Use Trajectories for Tool-Integrated Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23032</link><description>arXiv:2601.23032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks by interacting with external tools, yet existing approaches depend on high-quality synthesized trajectories selected by scoring functions and sparse outcome-based rewards, providing limited and biased supervision for learning TIR. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoTraj in TIR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23032v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MOSAIC: Modular Scalable Autonomy for Intelligent Coordination of Heterogeneous Robotic Teams</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23038</link><description>arXiv:2601.23038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile robots have become indispensable for exploring hostile environments, such as in space or disaster relief scenarios, but often remain limited to teleoperation by a human operator. This restricts the deployment scale and requires near-continuous low-latency communication between the operator and the robot. We present MOSAIC: a scalable autonomy framework for multi-robot scientific exploration using a unified mission abstraction based on Points of Interest (POIs) and multiple layers of autonomy, enabling supervision by a single operator. The framework dynamically allocates exploration and measurement tasks based on each robot's capabilities, leveraging team-level redundancy and specialization to enable continuous operation. We validated the framework in a space-analog field experiment emulating a lunar prospecting scenario, involving a heterogeneous team of five robots and a single operator. Despite the complete failure of one robot during the mission, the team completed 82.3% of assigned tasks at an Autonomy Ratio of 86%, while the operator workload remained at only 78.2%. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robust, scalable multi-robot scientific exploration with limited operator intervention. We further derive practical lessons learned in robot interoperability, networking architecture, team composition, and operator workload management to inform future multi-robot exploration missions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23038v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Avoiding Premature Collapse: Adaptive Annealing for Entropy-Regularized Structural Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23039</link><description>arXiv:2601.23039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable matching layers, often implemented via entropy-regularized Optimal Transport, serve as a critical approximate inference mechanism in structural prediction. However, recovering discrete permutations via annealing $\epsilon \to 0$ is notoriously unstable. We identify a fundamental mechanism for this failure: \textbf{Premature Mode Collapse}. By analyzing the non-normal dynamics of the Sinkhorn fixed-point map, we reveal a theoretical \textbf{thermodynamic speed limit}. Under standard exponential cooling, the shift in the target posterior ($O(1)$) outpaces the contraction rate of the inference operator, which degrades as $O(1/\epsilon)$. This mismatch inevitably forces the inference trajectory into spurious local basins. To address this, we propose \textbf{Efficient PH-ASC}, an adaptive scheduling algorithm that monitors the stability of the inference process. By enforcing a linear stability law, we decouple expensive spectral diagnostics from the training loop, reducing overhead from $O(N^3)$ to amortized $O(1)$.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but still suffer from hallucination and safety-related failures that persist even at scale. Steering offers a lightweight technique to improve model performance. However, steering, whether input-dependent or input-independent, achieves a meaningful trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we observe that steering vectors can generalize across inputs when tasks share aligned semantic intent. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{OSGA} (\textbf{O}ne-shot \textbf{S}teering with \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}nchor), an input-independent framework that improves model performance with a single optimization instance. OSGA first selects an informative sample via a variance-based data selection strategy and learns a single steering vector with a contrastive objective with generative anchor regularization. The resulting vector can be universally applied at a certain layer during inference time without modifying model parameters. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that a single OSGA-optimized steering vector consistently improves hallucination mitigation and safety enhancement with negligible overhead, highlighting one-shot steering as a practical and scalable solution for reliable VLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Hot Mess of AI: How Does Misalignment Scale With Model Intelligence and Task Complexity?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23045</link><description>arXiv:2601.23045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI becomes more capable, we entrust it with more general and consequential tasks. The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal. This increases the relative importance of alignment research targeting reward hacking or goal misspecification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23045v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Abstract to Contextual: What LLMs Still Cannot Do in Mathematics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23048</link><description>arXiv:2601.23048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models now solve many benchmark math problems at near-expert levels, yet this progress has not fully translated into reliable performance in real-world applications. We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving. Finally, we find that fine-tuning with scenario data improves performance, whereas formulation-only training is ineffective. However, performance gaps are only partially alleviated, highlighting contextual mathematical reasoning as a central unsolved challenge for LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MedMCP-Calc: Benchmarking LLMs for Realistic Medical Calculator Scenarios via MCP Integration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23049</link><description>arXiv:2601.23049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical calculators are fundamental to quantitative, evidence-based clinical practice. However, their real-world use is an adaptive, multi-stage process, requiring proactive EHR data acquisition, scenario-dependent calculator selection, and multi-step computation, whereas current benchmarks focus only on static single-step calculations with explicit instructions. To address these limitations, we introduce MedMCP-Calc, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MedMCP-Calc comprises 118 scenario tasks across 4 clinical domains, featuring fuzzy task descriptions mimicking natural queries, structured EHR database interaction, external reference retrieval, and process-level evaluation. Our evaluation of 23 leading models reveals critical limitations: even top performers like Claude Opus 4.5 exhibit substantial gaps, including difficulty selecting appropriate calculators for end-to-end workflows given fuzzy queries, poor performance in iterative SQL-based database interactions, and marked reluctance to leverage external tools for numerical computation. Performance also varies considerably across clinical domains. Building on these findings, we develop CalcMate, a fine-tuned model incorporating scenario planning and tool augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.

It has emerged as a vital enabling technology in the Industry 4.0 context. The present article examines the particular issue of synchronizing a digital twin while ensuring an accurate reflection of its physical counterpart. Despite the reported recent advances in the design of middleware and low delay communication technologies, effective synchronization between both worlds remains challenging. This paper reviews currently adopted synchronization technologies and architectures, identifies vital outstanding technical challenges, and proposes a unified synchronization architecture for use by various industrial applications while addressing security and interoperability requirements. As such, this study aims to bridges gaps and advance robust synchronization in DT environments, emphasizing the need for a standardized architecture to ensure seamless operation and continuous improvement of industrial systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23051v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Edge Learning for Density-Aware Graph Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23052</link><description>arXiv:2601.23052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating realistic graph-structured data is challenging due to discrete structures, variable sizes, and class-specific connectivity patterns that resist conventional generative modelling. While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become a cornerstone for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, where group-based approaches such as GRPO have emerged as efficient paradigms that optimize policies by leveraging intra-group performance differences. However, these methods typically rely on absolute numerical rewards, introducing intrinsic limitations. In verifiable tasks, identical group evaluations often result in sparse supervision, while in open-ended scenarios, the score range instability of reward models undermines advantage estimation based on group means. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Relative Rewards (RLRR), a framework that shifts reward shaping from absolute scoring to relative ranking. Complementing this framework, we introduce the Ranking Reward Model, a listwise preference model tailored for group-based optimization to directly generate relative rankings. By transforming raw evaluations into robust relative signals, RLRR effectively mitigates signal sparsity and reward instability. Experimental results demonstrate that RLRR yields consistent performance improvements over standard group-based baselines across reasoning benchmarks and open-ended generation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23058v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Impact of Code Comments for Automated Bug-Fixing: An Empirical Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23059</link><description>arXiv:2601.23059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relevant in Software Engineering research and practice, with Automated Bug Fixing (ABF) being one of their key applications. ABF involves transforming a buggy method into its fixed equivalent. A common preprocessing step in ABF involves removing comments from code prior to training. However, we hypothesize that comments may play a critical role in fixing certain types of bugs by providing valuable design and implementation insights. In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them. Additionally, an interpretability analysis identifies that comments detailing method implementation are particularly effective in aiding LLMs to fix bugs accurately.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23059v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating the Effectiveness of OpenAI's Parental Control System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23062</link><description>arXiv:2601.23062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate how effectively platform-level parental controls moderate a mainstream conversational assistant used by minors. Our two-phase protocol first builds a category-balanced conversation corpus via PAIR-style iterative prompt refinement over API, then has trained human agents replay/refine those prompts in the consumer UI using a designated child account while monitoring the linked parent inbox for alerts. We focus on seven risk areas -- physical harm, pornography, privacy violence, health consultation, fraud, hate speech, and malware and quantify four outcomes: Notification Rate (NR), Leak-Through (LR), Overblocking (OBR), and UI Intervention Rate (UIR). Using an automated judge (with targeted human audit) and comparing the current backend to legacy variants (GPT-4.1/4o), we find that notifications are selective rather than comprehensive: privacy violence, fraud, hate speech, and malware triggered no parental alerts in our runs, whereas physical harm (highest), pornography, and some health queries produced intermittent alerts. The current backend shows lower leak-through than legacy models, yet overblocking of benign, educational queries near sensitive topics remains common and is not surfaced to parents, revealing a policy-product gap between on-screen safeguards and parent-facing telemetry. We propose actionable fixes: broaden/configure the notification taxonomy, couple visible safeguards to privacy-preserving parent summaries, and prefer calibrated, age-appropriate safe rewrites over blanket refusals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23062v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gender Disparities in StackOverflow's Community-Based Question Answering: A Matter of Quantity versus Quality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23063</link><description>arXiv:2601.23063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community Question-Answering platforms, such as Stack Overflow (SO), are valuable knowledge exchange and problem-solving resources. These platforms incorporate mechanisms to assess the quality of answers and participants' expertise, ideally free from discriminatory biases. However, prior research has highlighted persistent gender biases, raising concerns about the inclusivity and fairness of these systems. Addressing such biases is crucial for fostering equitable online communities. While previous studies focus on detecting gender bias by comparing male and female user characteristics, they often overlook the interaction between genders, inherent answer quality, and the selection of ``best answers'' by question askers. In this study, we investigate whether answer quality is influenced by gender using a combination of human evaluations and automated assessments powered by Large Language Models. Our findings reveal no significant gender differences in answer quality, nor any substantial influence of gender bias on the selection of ``best answers." Instead, we find that the significant gender disparities in SO's reputation scores are primarily attributable to differences in users' activity levels, e.g., the number of questions and answers they write. Our results have important implications for the design of scoring systems in community question-answering platforms. In particular, reputation systems that heavily emphasize activity volume risk amplifying gender disparities that do not reflect actual differences in answer quality, calling for more equitable design strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23063v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HierLoc: Hyperbolic Entity Embeddings for Hierarchical Visual Geolocation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23064</link><description>arXiv:2601.23064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual geolocalization, the task of predicting where an image was taken, remains challenging due to global scale, visual ambiguity, and the inherently hierarchical structure of geography. Existing paradigms rely on either large-scale retrieval, which requires storing a large number of image embeddings, grid-based classifiers that ignore geographic continuity, or generative models that diffuse over space but struggle with fine detail. We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective. This hierarchical design enables interpretable predictions and efficient inference with 240k entity embeddings instead of over 5 million image embeddings on the OSV5M benchmark, on which our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the current methods in the literature, it reduces mean geodesic error by 19.5\%, while improving the fine-grained subregion accuracy by 43%. These results demonstrate that geometry-aware hierarchical embeddings provide a scalable and conceptually new alternative for global image geolocation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EAG-PT: Emission-Aware Gaussians and Path Tracing for Indoor Scene Reconstruction and Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23065</link><description>arXiv:2601.23065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reconstruction methods based on radiance field such as NeRF and 3DGS reproduce indoor scenes with high visual fidelity, but break down under scene editing due to baked illumination and the lack of explicit light transport. In contrast, physically based inverse rendering relies on mesh representations and path tracing, which enforce correct light transport but place strong requirements on geometric fidelity, becoming a practical bottleneck for real indoor scenes. In this work, we propose Emission-Aware Gaussians and Path Tracing (EAG-PT), aiming for physically based light transport with a unified 2D Gaussian representation. Our design is based on three cores: (1) using 2D Gaussians as a unified scene representation and transport-friendly geometry proxy that avoids reconstructed mesh, (2) explicitly separating emissive and non-emissive components during reconstruction for further scene editing, and (3) decoupling reconstruction from final rendering by using efficient single-bounce optimization and high-quality multi-bounce path tracing after scene editing. Experiments on synthetic and real indoor scenes show that EAG-PT produces more natural and physically consistent renders after editing than radiant scene reconstructions, while preserving finer geometric detail and avoiding mesh-induced artifacts compared to mesh-based inverse path tracing. These results suggest promising directions for future use in interior design, XR content creation, and embodied AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23065v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Explicit Acoustic Evidence Perception in Audio LLMs for Speech Deepfake Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23066</link><description>arXiv:2601.23066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech deepfake detection (SDD) focuses on identifying whether a given speech signal is genuine or has been synthetically generated. Existing audio large language model (LLM)-based methods excel in content understanding; however, their predictions are often biased toward semantically correlated cues, which results in fine-grained acoustic artifacts being overlooked during the decisionmaking process. Consequently, fake speech with natural semantics can bypass detectors despite harboring subtle acoustic anomalies; this suggests that the challenge stems not from the absence of acoustic data, but from its inadequate accessibility when semantic-dominant reasoning prevails. To address this issue, we investigate SDD within the audio LLM paradigm and introduce SDD with Auditory Perception-enhanced Audio Large Language Model (SDD-APALLM), an acoustically enhanced framework designed to explicitly expose fine-grained time-frequency evidence as accessible acoustic cues. By combining raw audio with structured spectrograms, the proposed framework empowers audio LLMs to more effectively capture subtle acoustic inconsistencies without compromising their semantic understanding. Experimental results indicate consistent gains in detection accuracy and robustness, especially in cases where semantic cues are misleading. Further analysis reveals that these improvements stem from a coordinated utilization of semantic and acoustic information, as opposed to simple modality aggregation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23066v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ExplainerPFN: Towards tabular foundation models for model-free zero-shot feature importance estimations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23068</link><description>arXiv:2601.23068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the importance of features in supervised classification tasks is critical for model interpretability. Shapley values are a widely used approach for explaining model predictions, but require direct access to the underlying model, an assumption frequently violated in real-world deployments. Further, even when model access is possible, their exact computation may be prohibitively expensive. We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.
  Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23068v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SplineFlow: Flow Matching for Dynamical Systems with B-Spline Interpolants</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23072</link><description>arXiv:2601.23072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching is a scalable generative framework for characterizing continuous normalizing flows with wide-range applications. However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since na\"ive higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

Abstract: On-policy deep reinforcement learning remains a dominant paradigm for continuous control, yet standard implementations rely on Gaussian actors and relatively shallow MLP policies, often leading to brittle optimization when gradients are noisy and policy updates must be conservative. In this paper, we revisit policy representation as a first-class design choice for on-policy optimization. We study discretized categorical actors that represent each action dimension with a distribution over bins, yielding a policy objective that resembles a cross-entropy loss. Building on architectural advances from supervised learning, we further propose regularized actor networks, while keeping critic design fixed. Our results show that simply replacing the standard actor network with our discretized regularized actor yields consistent gains and achieve the state-of-the-art performance across diverse continuous-control benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23075v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust and Generalized Humanoid Motion Tracking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23080</link><description>arXiv:2601.23080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning a general humanoid whole-body controller is challenging because practical reference motions can exhibit noise and inconsistencies after being transferred to the robot domain, and local defects may be amplified by closed-loop execution, causing drift or failure in highly dynamic and contact-rich behaviors. We propose a dynamics-conditioned command aggregation framework that uses a causal temporal encoder to summarize recent proprioception and a multi-head cross-attention command encoder to selectively aggregate a context window based on the current dynamics. We further integrate a fall recovery curriculum with random unstable initialization and an annealed upward assistance force to improve robustness and disturbance rejection. The resulting policy requires only about 3.5 hours of motion data and supports single-stage end-to-end training without distillation. The proposed method is evaluated under diverse reference inputs and challenging motion regimes, demonstrating zero-shot transfer to unseen motions as well as robust sim-to-real transfer on a physical humanoid robot.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23080v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Character as a Latent Variable in Large Language Models: A Mechanistic Account of Emergent Misalignment and Conditional Safety Failures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23081</link><description>arXiv:2601.23081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent Misalignment refers to a failure mode in which fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on narrowly scoped data induces broadly misaligned behavior. Prior explanations mainly attribute this phenomenon to the generalization of erroneous or unsafe content. In this work, we show that this view is incomplete. Across multiple domains and model families, we find that fine-tuning models on data exhibiting specific character-level dispositions induces substantially stronger and more transferable misalignment than incorrect-advice fine-tuning, while largely preserving general capabilities. This indicates that emergent misalignment arises from stable shifts in model behavior rather than from capability degradation or corrupted knowledge. We further show that such behavioral dispositions can be conditionally activated by both training-time triggers and inference-time persona-aligned prompts, revealing shared structure across emergent misalignment, backdoor activation, and jailbreak susceptibility. Overall, our results identify character formation as a central and underexplored alignment risk, suggesting that robust alignment must address behavioral dispositions rather than isolated errors or prompt-level defenses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23081v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OrLog: Resolving Complex Queries with LLMs and Probabilistic Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23085</link><description>arXiv:2601.23085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving complex information needs that come with multiple constraints should consider enforcing the logical operators encoded in the query (i.e., conjunction, disjunction, negation) on the candidate answer set. Current retrieval systems either ignore these constraints in neural embeddings or approximate them in a generative reasoning process that can be inconsistent and unreliable. Although well-suited to structured reasoning, existing neuro-symbolic approaches remain confined to formal logic or mathematics problems as they often assume unambiguous queries and access to complete evidence, conditions rarely met in information retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce OrLog, a neuro-symbolic retrieval framework that decouples predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning: a large language model (LLM) provides plausibility scores for atomic predicates in one decoding-free forward pass, from which a probabilistic reasoning engine derives the posterior probability of query satisfaction. We evaluate OrLog across multiple backbone LLMs, varying levels of access to external knowledge, and a range of logical constraints, and compare it against base retrievers and LLM-as-reasoner methods. Provided with entity descriptions, OrLog can significantly boost top-rank precision compared to LLM reasoning with larger gains on disjunctive queries. OrLog is also more efficient, cutting mean tokens by $\sim$90\% per query-entity pair. These results demonstrate that generation-free predicate plausibility estimation combined with probabilistic reasoning enables constraint-aware retrieval that outperforms monolithic reasoning while using far fewer tokens.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23085v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chain-of-thought obfuscation learned from output supervision can generalise to unseen tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23086</link><description>arXiv:2601.23086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning provides a significant performance uplift to LLMs by enabling planning, exploration, and deliberation of their actions. CoT is also a powerful tool for monitoring the behaviours of these agents: when faithful, they offer interpretations of the model's decision making process, and an early warning sign for dangerous behaviours. However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT. Our findings suggest that current practices of penalising harmful generations may inadvertently lead to a reduction in the broader monitorability of LLMs in unpredictable ways.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23086v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Temporally Coherent Imitation Learning via Latent Action Flow Matching for Robotic Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23087</link><description>arXiv:2601.23087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning long-horizon robotic manipulation requires jointly achieving expressive behavior modeling, real-time inference, and stable execution, which remains challenging for existing generative policies. Diffusion-based approaches provide strong modeling capacity but typically incur high inference latency, while flow matching enables fast one-step generation yet often leads to unstable execution when applied directly in the raw action space.
  We propose LG-Flow Policy, a trajectory-level imitation learning framework that performs flow matching in a continuous latent action space. By encoding action sequences into temporally regularized latent trajectories and learning an explicit latent-space flow, the proposed approach decouples global motion structure from low-level control noise, resulting in smooth and reliable long-horizon execution.
  LG-Flow Policy further incorporates geometry-aware point cloud conditioning and execution-time multimodal modulation, with visual cues evaluated as a representative modality in real-world settings. Experimental results in simulation and on physical robot platforms demonstrate that LG-Flow Policy achieves near single-step inference, substantially improves trajectory smoothness and task success over flow-based baselines operating in the raw action space, and remains significantly more efficient than diffusion-based policies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23087v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Similarity to Vulnerability: Key Collision Attack on LLM Semantic Caching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23088</link><description>arXiv:2601.23088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic caching has emerged as a pivotal technique for scaling LLM applications, widely adopted by major providers including AWS and Microsoft. By utilizing semantic embedding vectors as cache keys, this mechanism effectively minimizes latency and redundant computation for semantically similar queries. In this work, we conceptualize semantic cache keys as a form of fuzzy hashes. We demonstrate that the locality required to maximize cache hit rates fundamentally conflicts with the cryptographic avalanche effect necessary for collision resistance. Our conceptual analysis formalizes this inherent trade-off between performance (locality) and security (collision resilience), revealing that semantic caching is naturally vulnerable to key collision attacks.
  While prior research has focused on side-channel and privacy risks, we present the first systematic study of integrity risks arising from cache collisions. We introduce CacheAttack, an automated framework for launching black-box collision attacks. We evaluate CacheAttack in security-critical tasks and agentic workflows. It achieves a hit rate of 86\% in LLM response hijacking and can induce malicious behaviors in LLM agent, while preserving strong transferability across different embedding models. A case study on a financial agent further illustrates the real-world impact of these vulnerabilities. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23088v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WiFiPenTester: Advancing Wireless Ethical Hacking with Governed GenAI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23092</link><description>arXiv:2601.23092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless ethical hacking relies heavily on skilled practitioners manually interpreting reconnaissance results and executing complex, time-sensitive sequences of commands to identify vulnerable targets, capture authentication handshakes, and assess password resilience; a process that is inherently labour-intensive, difficult to scale, and prone to subjective judgement and human error. To help address these limitations, we propose WiFiPenTester, an experimental, governed, and reproducible system for GenAI-enabled wireless ethical hacking. The system integrates large language models into the reconnaissance and decision-support phases of wireless security assessment, enabling intelligent target ranking, attack feasibility estimation, and strategy recommendation, while preserving strict human-in-the-loop control and budget-aware execution. We describe the system architecture, threat model, governance mechanisms, and prompt-engineering methodology, and empirical experiments conducted across multiple wireless environments. The results demonstrate that GenAI assistance improves target selection accuracy and overall assessment efficiency, while maintaining auditability and ethical safeguards. This indicates that WiFiPenTester is a meaningful step toward practical, safe, and scalable GenAI-assisted wireless penetration testing, while reinforcing the necessity of bounded autonomy, human oversight, and rigorous governance mechanisms when deploying GenAI in ethical hacking.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23092v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Safer Policy Compliance with Dynamic Epistemic Fallback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23094</link><description>arXiv:2601.23094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans develop a series of cognitive defenses, known as epistemic vigilance, to combat risks of deception and misinformation from everyday interactions. Developing safeguards for LLMs inspired by this mechanism might be particularly helpful for their application in high-stakes tasks such as automating compliance with data privacy laws. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF), a dynamic safety protocol for improving an LLM's inference-time defenses against deceptive attacks that make use of maliciously perturbed policy texts. Through various levels of one-sentence textual cues, DEF nudges LLMs to flag inconsistencies, refuse compliance, and fallback to their parametric knowledge upon encountering perturbed policy texts. Using globally recognized legal policies such as HIPAA and GDPR, our empirical evaluations report that DEF effectively improves the capability of frontier LLMs to detect and refuse perturbed versions of policies, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving a 100% detection rate in one setting. This work encourages further efforts to develop cognitively inspired defenses to improve LLM robustness against forms of harm and deception that exploit legal artifacts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23094v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Sidewalk Sheds in New York City through Chatbot Surveys and Human Computer Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23095</link><description>arXiv:2601.23095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sidewalk sheds are a common feature of the streetscape in New York City, reflecting ongoing construction and maintenance activities. However, policymakers and local business owners have raised concerns about reduced storefront visibility and altered pedestrian navigation. Although sidewalk sheds are widely used for safety, their effects on pedestrian visibility and movement are not directly measured in current planning practices. To address this, we developed an AI-based chatbot survey that collects image-based annotations and route choices from pedestrians, linking these responses to specific shed design features, including clearance height, post spacing, and color. This AI chatbot survey integrates a large language model (e.g., Google's Gemini-1.5-flash-001 model) with an image-annotation interface, allowing users to interact with street images, mark visual elements, and provide structured feedback through guided dialogue. To explore pedestrian perceptions and behaviors, this paper conducts a grid-based analysis of entrance annotations and applies logistic mixed-effects modeling to assess sidewalk choice patterns. Analysis of the dataset (n = 25) shows that: (1) the presence of scaffolding significantly reduces pedestrians' ability to identify ground-floor retail entrances, and (2) variations in weather conditions and shed design features significantly influence sidewalk selection behavior. By integrating generative AI into urban research, this study demonstrates a novel method for evaluating sidewalk shed designs and provides empirical evidence to support adjustments to shed guidelines that improve the pedestrian experience without compromising safety.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23095v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CATTO: Balancing Preferences and Confidence in Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23096</link><description>arXiv:2601.23096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often make accurate next token predictions but their confidence in these predictions can be poorly calibrated: high-confidence predictions are frequently wrong, and low-confidence predictions may be correct. This miscalibration is exacerbated by preference-based alignment methods breaking the link between predictive probability and correctness. We introduce a Calibration Aware Token-level Training Objective (CATTO), a calibration-aware objective that aligns predicted confidence with empirical prediction correctness, which can be combined with the original preference optimization objectives. Empirically, CATTO reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.22%-7.61% in-distribution and 1.46%-10.44% out-of-distribution compared to direct preference optimization (DPO), and by 0.22%-1.24% in-distribution and 1.23%-5.07% out-of-distribution compared to the strongest DPO baseline. This improvement in confidence does not come at a cost of losing task accuracy, where CATTO maintains or slightly improves multiple-choice question-answering accuracy on five datasets. We also introduce Confidence@k, a test-time scaling mechanism leveraging calibrated token probabilities for Bayes-optimal selection of output tokens.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23096v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Point Clouds from a Compact Subspace Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23102</link><description>arXiv:2601.23102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transferable adversarial attacks on point clouds remain challenging, as existing methods often rely on model-specific gradients or heuristics that limit generalization to unseen architectures. In this paper, we rethink adversarial transferability from a compact subspace perspective and propose CoSA, a transferable attack framework that operates within a shared low-dimensional semantic space. Specifically, each point cloud is represented as a compact combination of class-specific prototypes that capture shared semantic structure, while adversarial perturbations are optimized within a low-rank subspace to induce coherent and architecture-agnostic variations. This design suppresses model-dependent noise and constrains perturbations to semantically meaningful directions, thereby improving cross-model transferability without relying on surrogate-specific artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and network architectures demonstrate that CoSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transferable attacks, while maintaining competitive imperceptibility and robustness under common defense strategies. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23102v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lossy Compression of Cellular Network KPIs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23105</link><description>arXiv:2601.23105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are a fundamental component of mobile cellular network monitoring and optimization. Their massive volume, resulting from fine-grained measurements collected across many cells over long time horizons, poses significant challenges for storage, transport, and large-scale analysis. In this letter, we show that common cellular KPIs can be efficiently compressed using standard lossy compression schemes based on prediction, quantization, and entropy coding, achieving substantial reductions in reporting overhead. Focusing on traffic volume KPIs, we first characterize their intrinsic compressibility through a rate-distortion analysis, showing that signal-to-noise ratios around 30 dB can be achieved using only 3-4 bits per sample, corresponding to an 8-10x reduction with respect to 32-bit floating-point representations. We then assess the impact of KPI compression on representative downstream analytics tasks. Our results show that aggregation across cells mitigates quantization errors and that prediction accuracy is unaffected beyond a moderate reporting rate. These findings indicate that KPI compression is feasible and transparent to network-level analytics in cellular systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23105v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlowCalib: LiDAR-to-Vehicle Miscalibration Detection using Scene Flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23107</link><description>arXiv:2601.23107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate sensor-to-vehicle calibration is essential for safe autonomous driving. Angular misalignments of LiDAR sensors can lead to safety-critical issues during autonomous operation. However, current methods primarily focus on correcting sensor-to-sensor errors without considering the miscalibration of individual sensors that cause these errors in the first place. We introduce FlowCalib, the first framework that detects LiDAR-to-vehicle miscalibration using motion cues from the scene flow of static objects. Our approach leverages the systematic bias induced by rotational misalignment in the flow field generated from sequential 3D point clouds, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The architecture integrates a neural scene flow prior for flow estimation and incorporates a dual-branch detection network that fuses learned global flow features with handcrafted geometric descriptors. These combined representations allow the system to perform two complementary binary classification tasks: a global binary decision indicating whether misalignment is present and separate, axis-specific binary decisions indicating whether each rotational axis is misaligned. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate FlowCalib's ability to robustly detect miscalibration, establishing a benchmark for sensor-to-vehicle miscalibration detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23107v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Energy Management Strategies for Electric Aircraft Charging Leveraging Active Landside Vehicle-to-Grid</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23108</link><description>arXiv:2601.23108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of medium-range battery electric aircraft is a promising pathway to improve the environmental footprint of air mobility. Yet such a deployment would be accompanied by significant electric power requirements at airports due to aircraft charging. Given the growing prevalence of electric vehicles and their bi-directional charging capabilities--so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G)--we study energy buffer capabilities of parked electric vehicles to alleviate pressure on grid connections. To this end, we present energy management strategies for airports providing cost-optimal apron and landside V2G charge scheduling. Specifically, we first formulate the optimal energy management problem of joint aircraft charging and landside V2G coordination as a linear program, whereby we use partial differential equations to model the aggregated charging dynamics of the electric vehicle fleet. Second, we consider a shuttle flight network with a single hub of a large Dutch airline, real-world grid prices, and synthetic parking garage occupancy data to test our framework. Our results show that V2G at even a single airport can indeed reduce energy costs to charge the aircraft fleet: Compared to a baseline scenario without V2G, the proposed concept yields cost savings of up to 32%, depending on the schedule and amount of participating vehicles, and has other potential beneficial effects on the local power grid, e.g., the reduction of potential power peaks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23108v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How should AI Safety Benchmarks Benchmark Safety?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23112</link><description>arXiv:2601.23112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI safety benchmarks are pivotal for safety in advanced AI systems; however, they have significant technical, epistemic, and sociotechnical shortcomings. We present a review of 210 safety benchmarks that maps out common challenges in safety benchmarking, documenting failures and limitations by drawing from engineering sciences and long-established theories of risk and safety. We argue that adhering to established risk management principles, mapping the space of what can(not) be measured, developing robust probabilistic metrics, and efficiently deploying measurement theory to connect benchmarking objectives with the world can significantly improve the validity and usefulness of AI safety benchmarks. The review provides a roadmap on how to improve AI safety benchmarking, and we illustrate the effectiveness of these recommendations through quantitative and qualitative evaluation. We also introduce a checklist that can help researchers and practitioners develop robust and epistemologically sound safety benchmarks. This study advances the science of benchmarking and helps practitioners deploy AI systems more responsibly.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] To See Far, Look Close: Evolutionary Forecasting for Long-term Time Series</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23114</link><description>arXiv:2601.23114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing Direct Forecasting (DF) paradigm dominates Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) by forcing models to predict the entire future horizon in a single forward pass. While efficient, this rigid coupling of output and evaluation horizons necessitates computationally prohibitive re-training for every target horizon. In this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive optimization anomaly: models trained on short horizons-when coupled with our proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm-significantly outperform those trained directly on long horizons. We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a singular EF model surpasses task-specific DF ensembles across standard benchmarks and exhibits robust asymptotic stability in extreme extrapolation. This work propels a paradigm shift in LTSF: moving from passive Static Mapping to autonomous Evolutionary Reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Automatic Deep Learning Approach for Trailer Generation through Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23121</link><description>arXiv:2601.23121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trailers are short promotional videos designed to provide audiences with a glimpse of a movie. The process of creating a trailer typically involves selecting key scenes, dialogues and action sequences from the main content and editing them together in a way that effectively conveys the tone, theme and overall appeal of the movie. This often includes adding music, sound effects, visual effects and text overlays to enhance the impact of the trailer. In this paper, we present a framework exploiting a comprehensive multimodal strategy for automated trailer production. Also, a Large Language Model (LLM) is adopted across various stages of the trailer creation. First, it selects main key visual sequences that are relevant to the movie's core narrative. Then, it extracts the most appealing quotes from the movie, aligning them with the trailer's narrative. Additionally, the LLM assists in creating music backgrounds and voiceovers to enrich the audience's engagement, thus contributing to make a trailer not just a summary of the movie's content but a narrative experience in itself. Results show that our framework generates trailers that are more visually appealing to viewers compared to those produced by previous state-of-the-art competitors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23121v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Greedy Routing Reachability Games</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23126</link><description>arXiv:2601.23126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's networks consist of many autonomous entities that follow their own objectives, i.e., smart devices or parts of large AI systems, that are interconnected. Given the size and complexity of most communication networks, each entity typically only has a local view and thus must rely on a local routing protocol for sending and forwarding packets. A common solution for this is greedy routing, where packets are locally forwarded to a neighbor in the network that is closer to the packet's destination.
  In this paper we investigate a game-theoretic model with autonomous agents that aim at forming a network where greedy routing is enabled. The agents are positioned in a metric space and each agent tries to establish as few links as possible, while maintaining that it can reach every other agent via greedy routing. Thus, this model captures how greedy routing networks are formed without any assumption on the distribution of the agents or the specific employed greedy routing protocol. Hence, it distills the essence that makes greedy routing work.
  We study two variants of the model: with directed edges or with undirected edges. For the former, we show that equilibria exist, have optimal total cost, and that in Euclidean metrics they can be found efficiently. However, even for this simple setting computing optimal strategies is NP-hard. For the much more challenging setting with undirected edges, we show for the realistic setting with agents in 2D Euclidean space that the price of anarchy is between 1.75 and 1.8 and for higher dimensions it is less than 2. Also, we show that best response dynamics may cycle, but that in Euclidean space almost optimal approximate equilibria can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, for 2D Euclidean space, these approximate equilibria outperform the well-known Delaunay triangulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23126v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "I Choose to Live, for Life Itself": Understanding Agency of Home-Based Care Patients Through Information Practices and Relational Dynamics in Care Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23127</link><description>arXiv:2601.23127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Home-based care (HBC) delivers medical and care services in patients' living environments, offering unique opportunities for patient-centered care. However, patient agency is often inadequately represented in shared HBC planning processes. Through 23 multi-stakeholder interviews with HBC patients, healthcare professionals, and care workers, alongside 60 hours of ethnographic observations, we examined how patient agency manifests in HBC and why this representation gap occurs. Our findings reveal that patient agency is not a static individual attribute but a relational capacity shaped through maintaining everyday continuity, mutual recognition from care providers, and engagement with material home environments. Furthermore, we identified that structured documentation systems filter out contextual knowledge, informal communication channels fragment patient voices, and doctor-centered hierarchies position patients as passive recipients. Drawing on these insights, we propose design considerations to bridge this representation gap and to integrate patient agency into shared HBC plans.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23127v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distribution-informed Efficient Conformal Prediction for Full Ranking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23128</link><description>arXiv:2601.23128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty is critical for the safe deployment of ranking models in real-world applications. Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DCR, reducing average prediction set size by up to 36%, while maintaining valid coverage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23128v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating the Utility of Grounding Documents with Reference-Free LLM-based Metrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23129</link><description>arXiv:2601.23129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)'s success depends on the utility the LLM derives from the content used for grounding. Quantifying content utility does not have a definitive specification and existing metrics ignore model-specific capabilities and/or rely on costly annotations. In this paper, we propose Grounding Generation Utility (GroGU), a model-specific and reference-free metric that defines utility as a function of the downstream LLM's generation confidence based on entropy. Despite having no annotation requirements, GroGU is largely faithful in distinguishing ground-truth documents while capturing nuances ignored by LLM-agnostic metrics. We apply GroGU to train a query-rewriter for RAG by identifying high-utility preference data for Direct Preference Optimization. Experiments show improvements by up to 18.2 points in Mean Reciprocal Rank and up to 9.4 points in answer accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23129v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synthesizing Petri Nets from Labelled Petri Nets using Token Trail Regions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23130</link><description>arXiv:2601.23130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesis automatically generates a process model from a behavioural specification. When the target model is a Petri net, we address synthesis through region theory. Researchers have studied region-based synthesis extensively for state-based specifications, such as transition systems and step-transition systems, as well as for language-based specifications. Accordingly, in literature, region theory is divided into two main branches: state-based regions and language-based regions. Using state-based regions, the behavioural specification is a set of global states and related state-transitions. This representation can express conflicts and the merging of global states naturally. However, it suffers from state explosion and can not express concurrency explicitly. Using language-based regions, the behavioural specification is a set of example runs defined by partially or totally ordered sets of events. This representation can express concurrency and branching naturally. However, it grows rapidly with the number of choices and can not express merging of conflicts. So far, synthesis requires a trade-off between these two approaches. Both region definitions have fundamental limitations, and synthesis therefore always involves a compromise. In this paper, we lift these limitations by introducing a new region theory that covers both state-based and language-based input. We prove that the new definition is a region meta theory that combines both concepts. It uses specifications given as a set of labelled nets, which allow us to express conflicts, concurrency and merging of local states naturally, and synthesizes a Petri net that simulates all labelled nets of the input specification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23130v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Regularisation in neural networks: a survey and empirical analysis of approaches</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23131</link><description>arXiv:2601.23131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite huge successes on a wide range of tasks, neural networks are known to sometimes struggle to generalise to unseen data. Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent. We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23131v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Secure Tool Manifest and Digital Signing Solution for Verifiable MCP and LLM Pipelines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23132</link><description>arXiv:2601.23132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in sensitive domains such as healthcare and financial institutions' data analytics; however, their execution pipelines remain vulnerable to manipulation and unverifiable behavior. Existing control mechanisms, such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP), define compliance policies for tool invocation but lack verifiable enforcement and transparent validation of model actions. To address this gap, we propose a novel Secure Tool Manifest and Digital Signing Framework, a structured and security-aware extension of Model Context Protocols. The framework enforces cryptographically signed manifests, integrates transparent verification logs, and isolates model-internal execution metadata from user-visible components to ensure verifiable execution integrity. Furthermore, the evaluation demonstrates that the framework scales nearly linearly (R-squared = 0.998), achieves near-perfect acceptance of valid executions while consistently rejecting invalid ones, and maintains balanced model utilization across execution pipelines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAudit: A Blind Auditing Protocol for Large Language Model Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23133</link><description>arXiv:2601.23133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time scaling can amplify reasoning pathologies: sycophancy, rung collapse, and premature certainty. We present RAudit, a diagnostic protocol for auditing LLM reasoning without ground truth access. The key constraint is blindness: the auditor evaluates only whether derivation steps support conclusions, enabling detection of trace-output inconsistency and, when latent competence exists, its recovery. RAudit measures process quality via CRIT-based reasonableness scores and varies critique formulation to study how social framing affects model response. We prove bounded correction and $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ termination. Experiments on mathematical reasoning (CAP-GSM8K) and causal judgment (CausalL2) reveal four mechanisms explaining model unreliability: (1) Latent Competence Suppression, where models derive correct answers then overwrite them under social pressure; (2) The False Competence Trap, where weaker judges mask sycophancy that stronger judges expose; (3) The Complexity-Vulnerability Tradeoff, where causal tasks induce more than 10 times higher sycophancy than mathematical tasks; and (4) Iatrogenic Critique, where authoritative correction harms weaker models. These findings challenge assumptions that capability implies robustness and that stronger feedback yields better outputs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23133v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning for Energy-Performance-aware Scheduling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23134</link><description>arXiv:2601.23134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the post-Dennard era, optimizing embedded systems requires navigating complex trade-offs between energy efficiency and latency. Traditional heuristic tuning is often inefficient in such high-dimensional, non-smooth landscapes. In this work, we propose a Bayesian Optimization framework using Gaussian Processes to automate the search for optimal scheduling configurations on heterogeneous multi-core architectures. We explicitly address the multi-objective nature of the problem by approximating the Pareto Frontier between energy and time. Furthermore, by incorporating Sensitivity Analysis (fANOVA) and comparing different covariance kernels (e.g., Mat\'ern vs. RBF), we provide physical interpretability to the black-box model, revealing the dominant hardware parameters driving system performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23134v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why GRPO Needs Normalization: A Local-Curvature Perspective on Adaptive Gradients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23135</link><description>arXiv:2601.23135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key driver of language model reasoning. Among RL algorithms, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is the de facto standard, avoiding the need for a critic by using per-prompt baselines and variance normalization. Yet why and when this normalization helps remains unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation through the lens of local curvature of the sequence-level policy gradient: standard deviation normalization implements an adaptive gradient. Theoretically, under mild conditions, GRPO enjoys a strictly improved convergence rate over unnormalized REINFORCE, with gains characterized by the average within-prompt reward standard deviation across prompts and iterations. Empirically, our analysis on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks reveals three distinct training phases governed by the interplay between feature orthogonality and reward variance: (I) an early acceleration phase where high variance and orthogonality favor adaptive scaling; (II) a relatively stable transition phase; and (III) a late-stage regime where the loss of orthogonality limits further gains. Together, these results provide a principled account of when std normalization helps in GRPO, and offer broader insights into the design of critic-free RL algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23135v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated Testing of Prevalent 3D User Interactions in Virtual Reality Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23139</link><description>arXiv:2601.23139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) technologies offer immersive user experiences across various domains, but present unique testing challenges compared to traditional software. Existing VR testing approaches enable scene navigation and interaction activation, but lack the ability to automatically synthesise realistic 3D user inputs (e.g, grab and trigger actions via hand-held controllers). Automated testing that generates and executes such input remains an unresolved challenge. Furthermore, existing metrics fail to robustly capture diverse interaction coverage. This paper addresses these gaps through four key contributions. First, we empirically identify four prevalent interaction types in nine open-source VR projects: fire, manipulate, socket, and custom. Second, we introduce the Interaction Flow Graph, a novel abstraction that systematically models 3D user interactions by identifying targets, actions, and conditions. Third, we construct XRBench3D, a benchmark comprising ten VR scenes that encompass 456 distinct user interactions for evaluating VR interaction testing. Finally, we present XRintTest, an automated testing approach that leverages this graph for dynamic scene exploration and interaction execution. Evaluation on XRBench3D shows that XRintTest achieves great effectiveness, reaching 93% coverage of fire, manipulate and socket interactions across all scenes, and performing 12x more effectively and 6x more efficiently than random exploration. Moreover, XRintTest can detect runtime exceptions and non-exception interaction issues, including subtle configuration defects. In addition, the Interaction Flow Graph can reveal potential interaction design smells that may compromise intended functionality and hinder testing performance for VR applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23139v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Monolith to Microservices: A Comparative Evaluation of Decomposition Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23141</link><description>arXiv:2601.23141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software modernisation through the migration from monolithic architectures to microservices has become increasingly critical, yet identifying effective service boundaries remains a complex and unresolved challenge. Although numerous automated microservice decomposition frameworks have been proposed, their evaluation is often fragmented due to inconsistent benchmark systems, incompatible metrics, and limited reproducibility, thus hindering objective comparison. This work presents a unified comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art microservice decomposition approaches spanning static, dynamic, and hybrid techniques. Using a consistent metric computation pipeline, we assess the decomposition quality across widely used benchmark systems (JPetStore, AcmeAir, DayTrader, and Plants) using Structural Modularity (SM), Interface Number(IFN), Inter-partition Communication (ICP), Non-Extreme Distribution (NED), and related indicators. Our analysis combines results reported in prior studies with experimentally reproduced outputs from available replication packages. Findings indicate that the hierarchical clustering-based methods, particularly HDBScan, produce the most consistently balanced decompositions across benchmarks, achieving strong modularity while minimizing communication and interface overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23141v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Good, Stay Longer?

Abstract: Open Source Software (OSS) sustainability relies on newcomers transitioning to core contributors, but this pipeline is broken, with most newcomers becoming inactive after initial contributions. Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects, which prioritize societal impact as their primary mission, may be associated with different newcomer-to-core transition outcomes than conventional OSS projects. We compared 375 projects (190 OSS4SG, 185 OSS), analyzing 92,721 contributors and 3.5 million commits. OSS4SG projects retain contributors at 2.2X higher rates and contributors have 19.6% higher probability of achieving core status. Early broad project exploration predicts core achievement (22.2% importance); conventional OSS concentrates on one dominant pathway (61.62% of transitions) while OSS4SG provides multiple pathways. Contrary to intuition, contributors who invest time learning the project before intensifying their contributions (Late Spike pattern) achieve core status 2.4-2.9X faster (21 weeks) than those who contribute intensively from day one (Early Spike pattern, 51-60 weeks). OSS4SG supports two effective temporal patterns while only Late Spike achieves fastest time-to-core in conventional OSS. Our findings suggest that finding a project aligned with personal values and taking time to understand the codebase before major contributions are key strategies for achieving core status. Our findings show that project mission is associated with measurably different environments for newcomer-to-core transitions and provide evidence-based guidance for newcomers and maintainers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23142v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] THINKSAFE: Self-Generated Safety Alignment for Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23143</link><description>arXiv:2601.23143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning tasks to generate long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this over-optimization often prioritizes compliance, making models vulnerable to harmful prompts. To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency. Notably, it achieves superior safety and comparable reasoning to GRPO, with significantly reduced computational cost.

Abstract: The integrity of time in distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices is crucial for reliable operation in energy cyber-physical systems, such as smart grids and microgrids. However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d &gt; 1.8, p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, STGAT reduces detection delay by 26%, achieving a 2.3-time-step delay while maintaining stable performance under overflow, drift, and physical inconsistencies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23147v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hearing is Believing?

Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) have recently shown strong capabilities in unified reasoning over speech, sound, and natural language; yet they inherit behavioral issues observed in Large Language Models, including sycophancy--the tendency to agree with user assertions even when they contradict objective evidence. While sycophancy has been extensively studied in text and vision-language models, its manifestation in audio-conditioned reasoning remains largely unexplored, despite the need for ALMs to rely on auditory cues such as acoustic events, speaker characteristics, and speech rate. To address this gap, we introduce SYAUDIO, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating sycophancy in ALMs, consisting of 4,319 audio questions spanning Audio Perception, Audio Reasoning, Audio Math, and Audio Ethics. Built upon established audio benchmarks and augmented with TTS-generated arithmetic and moral reasoning tasks, SYAUDIO enables systematic evaluation across multiple domains and sycophancy types with carefully verified data quality. Furthermore, we analyze audio-specific sycophancy under realistic conditions involving noise and rate, and demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning with chain-of-thought data is an effective mitigation strategy for reducing sycophantic behavior in ALMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23149v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Manifold-Aware Perturbations for Constrained Generative Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23151</link><description>arXiv:2601.23151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have enjoyed widespread success in a variety of applications.

In this work, we develop a computationally cheap, mathematically justified, and highly flexible distributional modification for combating known pitfalls in equality-constrained generative models. We propose perturbing the data distribution in a constraint-aware way such that the new distribution has support matching the ambient space dimension while still implicitly incorporating underlying manifold geometry. Through theoretical analyses and empirical evidence on several representative tasks, we illustrate that our approach consistently enables data distribution recovery and stable sampling with both diffusion models and normalizing flows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Behemoth: Benchmarking Unlearning in LLMs Using Fully Synthetic Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23153</link><description>arXiv:2601.23153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial neural networks, and specifically large language models, have improved rapidly in capabilities and quality, they have increasingly been deployed in real-world applications, from customer service to Google search, despite the fact that they frequently make factually incorrect or undesirable statements. This trend has inspired practical and academic interest in model editing, that is, in adjusting the weights of the model to modify its likely outputs for queries relating to a specific fact or set of facts. This may be done either to amend a fact or set of facts, for instance, to fix a frequent error in the training data, or to suppress a fact or set of facts entirely, for instance, in case of dangerous knowledge. Multiple methods have been proposed to do such edits. However, at the same time, it has been shown that such model editing can be brittle and incomplete. Moreover the effectiveness of any model editing method necessarily depends on the data on which the model is trained, and, therefore, a good understanding of the interaction of the training data distribution and the way it is stored in the network is necessary and helpful to reliably perform model editing. However, working with large language models trained on real-world data does not allow us to understand this relationship or fully measure the effects of model editing. We therefore propose Behemoth, a fully synthetic data generation framework. To demonstrate the practical insights from the framework, we explore model editing in the context of simple tabular data, demonstrating surprising findings that, in some cases, echo real-world results, for instance, that in some cases restricting the update rank results in a more effective update. The code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/behemoth.git.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23153v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPICE: Submodular Penalized Information-Conflict Selection for Efficient Large Language Model Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23155</link><description>arXiv:2601.23155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-based data selection for instruction tuning is compelling: maximizing the log-determinant of the Fisher information yields a monotone submodular objective, enabling greedy algorithms to achieve a $(1-1/e)$ approximation under a cardinality budget. In practice, however, we identify alleviating gradient conflicts, misalignment between per-sample gradients, is a key factor that slows down the decay of marginal log-determinant information gains, thereby preventing significant loss of information. We formalize this via an $\varepsilon$-decomposition that quantifies the deviation from ideal submodularity as a function of conflict statistics, yielding data-dependent approximation factors that tighten as conflicts diminish. Guided by this analysis, we propose SPICE, a conflict-aware selector that maximizes information while penalizing misalignment, and that supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency. Empirically, SPICE selects subsets with higher log-determinant information than original criteria, and these informational gains translate into performance improvements: across 8 benchmarks with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B, SPICE uses only 10% of the data, yet matches or exceeds 6 methods including full-data tuning. This achieves performance improvements with substantially lower training cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23155v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Segment Any Events with Language</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23159</link><description>arXiv:2601.23159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene understanding with free-form language has been widely explored within diverse modalities such as images, point clouds, and LiDAR. However, related studies on event sensors are scarce or narrowly centered on semantic-level understanding. We introduce SEAL, the first Semantic-aware Segment Any Events framework that addresses Open-Vocabulary Event Instance Segmentation (OV-EIS). Given the visual prompt, our model presents a unified framework to support both event segmentation and open-vocabulary mask classification at multiple levels of granularity, including instance-level and part-level. To enable thorough evaluation on OV-EIS, we curate four benchmarks that cover label granularity from coarse to fine class configurations and semantic granularity from instance-level to part-level understanding. Extensive experiments show that our SEAL largely outperforms proposed baselines in terms of performance and inference speed with a parameter-efficient architecture. In the Appendix, we further present a simple variant of our SEAL achieving generic spatiotemporal OV-EIS that does not require any visual prompts from users in the inference.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large audio language models (LALMs) such as Qwen-2.5-Omni have achieved strong performance on audio understanding and interaction, but scaling them remains costly in data and computation, and strictly sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently been shown to make effective use of limited training data, and prior work on DIFFA indicates that replacing an AR backbone with a diffusion counterpart can substantially improve audio understanding under matched settings, albeit at a proof-of-concept scale without large-scale instruction tuning, preference alignment, or practical decoding schemes. We introduce DIFFA-2, a practical diffusion-based LALM for general audio understanding. DIFFA-2 upgrades the speech encoder, employs dual semantic and acoustic adapters, and is trained with a four-stage curriculum that combines semantic and acoustic alignment, large-scale supervised fine-tuning, and variance-reduced preference optimization, using only fully open-source corpora. Experiments on MMSU, MMAU, and MMAR show that DIFFA-2 consistently improves over DIFFA and is competitive to strong AR LALMs under practical training budgets, supporting diffusion-based modeling is a viable backbone for large-scale audio understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/DIFFA.git.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23161v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probing the Trajectories of Reasoning Traces in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23163</link><description>arXiv:2601.23163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve difficult problems by producing "reasoning traces" before emitting a final response. However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic "reasoning style" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23163v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic Linear Bandits with Parameter Noise</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23164</link><description>arXiv:2601.23164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stochastic linear bandits with parameter noise model, in which the reward of action $a$ is $a^\top \theta$ where $\theta$ is sampled i.i.d. We show a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{O} (\sqrt{d T \log (K/\delta) \sigma^2_{\max})}$ for a horizon $T$, general action set of size $K$ of dimension $d$, and where $\sigma^2_{\max}$ is the maximal variance of the reward for any action. We further provide a lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega} (d \sqrt{T \sigma^2_{\max}})$ which is tight (up to logarithmic factors) whenever $\log (K) \approx d$. For more specific action sets, $\ell_p$ unit balls with $p \leq 2$ and dual norm $q$, we show that the minimax regret is $\widetilde{\Theta} (\sqrt{dT \sigma^2_q)}$, where $\sigma^2_q$ is a variance-dependent quantity that is always at most $4$. This is in contrast to the minimax regret attainable for such sets in the classic additive noise model, where the regret is of order $d \sqrt{T}$. Surprisingly, we show that this optimal (up to logarithmic factors) regret bound is attainable using a very simple explore-exploit algorithm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23164v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Monotonic Reference-Free Refinement for Autoformalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23166</link><description>arXiv:2601.23166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While statement autoformalization has advanced rapidly, full-theorem autoformalization remains largely unexplored. Existing iterative refinement methods in statement autoformalization typicall improve isolated aspects of formalization, such as syntactic correctness, but struggle to jointly optimizing multiple quality dimensions, which is critical for full-theorem autoformalization. We introduce a reference-free iterative monotonic process for full-theorem autoformalization that leverages complementary feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges, without access to ground-truth proofs or existing formalizations at inference time. Our approach optimizes a masked composite objective over Formal Validity, Logical Preservation, Mathematical Consistency, and Formal Quality, guided by a responsiveness map that indicates how different LLMs acting as different roles preferentially improve each dimension. We further propose an acceptance policy that guarantees certified monotonic improvement, and provide conditions ensuring convergence and termination. Empirical experiments demonstrate the proposed process enables simultaneous improvement across multiple dimensions, achieving 93.44% formal validity and a 78.22% overall score on miniF2F, and 44.09% formal validity and a 29.79% overall score on ProofNet.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23166v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hi-Light: A Path to high-fidelity, high-resolution video relighting with a Novel Evaluation Paradigm</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23167</link><description>arXiv:2601.23167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video relighting offers immense creative potential and commercial value but is hindered by challenges, including the absence of an adequate evaluation metric, severe light flickering, and the degradation of fine-grained details during editing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hi-Light, a novel, training-free framework for high-fidelity, high-resolution, robust video relighting. Our approach introduces three technical innovations: lightness prior anchored guided relighting diffusion that stabilises intermediate relit video, a Hybrid Motion-Adaptive Lighting Smoothing Filter that leverages optical flow to ensure temporal stability without introducing motion blur, and a LAB-based Detail Fusion module that preserves high-frequency detail information from the original video. Furthermore, to address the critical gap in evaluation, we propose the Light Stability Score, the first quantitative metric designed to specifically measure lighting consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-Light significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, producing stable, highly detailed relit videos.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23167v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Names Don't Matter: Symbol-Invariant Transformer for Open-Vocabulary Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23169</link><description>arXiv:2601.23169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current neural architectures lack a principled way to handle interchangeable tokens, i.e., symbols that are semantically equivalent yet distinguishable, such as bound variables. As a result, models trained on fixed vocabularies often struggle to generalize to unseen symbols, even when the underlying semantics remain unchanged. We propose a novel Transformer-based mechanism that is provably invariant to the renaming of interchangeable tokens. Our approach employs parallel embedding streams to isolate the contribution of each interchangeable token in the input, combined with an aggregated attention mechanism that enables structured information sharing across streams. Experimental results confirm the theoretical guarantees of our method and demonstrate substantial performance gains on open-vocabulary tasks that require generalization to novel symbols.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23169v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Fixed Frames: Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23174</link><description>arXiv:2601.23174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23174v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MeshGraphNet-Transformer: Scalable Mesh-based Learned Simulation for Solid Mechanics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23177</link><description>arXiv:2601.23177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MeshGraphNet-Transformer (MGN-T), a novel architecture that combines the global modeling capabilities of Transformers with the geometric inductive bias of MeshGraphNets, while preserving a mesh-based graph representation. MGN-T overcomes a key limitation of standard MGN, the inefficient long-range information propagation caused by iterative message passing on large, high-resolution meshes. A physics-attention Transformer serves as a global processor, updating all nodal states simultaneously while explicitly retaining node and edge attributes. By directly capturing long-range physical interactions, MGN-T eliminates the need for deep message-passing stacks or hierarchical, coarsened meshes, enabling efficient learning on high-resolution meshes with varying geometries, topologies, and boundary conditions at an industrial scale.
  We demonstrate that MGN-T successfully handles industrial-scale meshes for impact dynamics, a setting in which standard MGN fails due message-passing under-reaching. The method accurately models self-contact, plasticity, and multivariate outputs, including internal, phenomenological plastic variables. Moreover, MGN-T outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on classical benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining practical efficiency, using only a fraction of the parameters required by competing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23177v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Make Anything Match Your Target: Universal Adversarial Perturbations against Closed-Source MLLMs via Multi-Crop Routed Meta Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23179</link><description>arXiv:2601.23179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks on closed-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been increasingly explored under black-box transfer, yet prior methods are predominantly sample-specific and offer limited reusability across inputs. We instead study a more stringent setting, Universal Targeted Transferable Adversarial Attacks (UTTAA), where a single perturbation must consistently steer arbitrary inputs toward a specified target across unknown commercial MLLMs. Naively adapting existing sample-wise attacks to this universal setting faces three core difficulties: (i) target supervision becomes high-variance due to target-crop randomness, (ii) token-wise matching is unreliable because universality suppresses image-specific cues that would otherwise anchor alignment, and (iii) few-source per-target adaptation is highly initialization-sensitive, which can degrade the attainable performance. In this work, we propose MCRMO-Attack, which stabilizes supervision via Multi-Crop Aggregation with an Attention-Guided Crop, improves token-level reliability through alignability-gated Token Routing, and meta-learns a cross-target perturbation prior that yields stronger per-target solutions. Across commercial MLLMs, we boost unseen-image attack success rate by +23.7\% on GPT-4o and +19.9\% on Gemini-2.0 over the strongest universal baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23179v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TriSpec: Ternary Speculative Decoding via Lightweight Proxy Verification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23180</link><description>arXiv:2601.23180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference efficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by their serial, autoregressive generation, especially as reasoning becomes a key capability and response sequences grow longer. Speculative decoding (SD) offers a powerful solution, providing significant speed-ups through its lightweight drafting and parallel verification mechanism. While existing work has nearly saturated improvements in draft effectiveness and efficiency, this paper advances SD from a new yet critical perspective: the verification cost. We propose TriSpec, a novel ternary SD framework that, at its core, introduces a lightweight proxy to significantly reduce computational cost by approving easily verifiable draft sequences and engaging the full target model only when encountering uncertain tokens. TriSpec can be integrated with state-of-the-art SD methods like EAGLE-3 to further reduce verification costs, achieving greater acceleration. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen/LLaMA families show that TriSpec achieves up to 35\% speedup over standard SD, with up to 50\% fewer target model invocations while maintaining comparable accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23180v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ensuring Semantics in Weights of Implicit Neural Representations through the Implicit Function Theorem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23181</link><description>arXiv:2601.23181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weight Space Learning (WSL), which frames neural network weights as a data modality, is an emerging field with potential for tasks like meta-learning or transfer learning. Particularly, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) provide a convenient testbed, where each set of weights determines the corresponding individual data sample as a mapping from coordinates to contextual values. So far, a precise theoretical explanation for the mechanism of encoding semantics of data into network weights is still missing. In this work, we deploy the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) to establish a rigorous mapping between the data space and its latent weight representation space. We analyze a framework that maps instance-specific embeddings to INR weights via a shared hypernetwork, achieving performance competitive with existing baselines on downstream classification tasks across 2D and 3D datasets. These findings offer a theoretical lens for future investigations into network weights.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FourierSampler: Unlocking Non-Autoregressive Potential in Diffusion Language Models via Frequency-Guided Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23182</link><description>arXiv:2601.23182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the non-autoregressive potential of diffusion language models (dLLMs), existing decoding strategies demonstrate positional bias, failing to fully unlock the potential of arbitrary generation. In this work, we delve into the inherent spectral characteristics of dLLMs and present the first frequency-domain analysis showing that low-frequency components in hidden states primarily encode global structural information and long-range dependencies, while high-frequency components are responsible for characterizing local details. Based on this observation, we propose FourierSampler, which leverages a frequency-domain sliding window mechanism to dynamically guide the model to achieve a "structure-to-detail" generation. FourierSampler outperforms other inference enhancement strategies on LLADA and SDAR, achieving relative improvements of 20.4% on LLaDA1.5-8B and 16.0% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct. It notably surpasses similarly sized autoregressive models like Llama3.1-8B-Instruct.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23182v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] JobResQA: A Benchmark for LLM Machine Reading Comprehension on Multilingual R\'esum\'es and JDs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23183</link><description>arXiv:2601.23183v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), explicit reasoning chains introduce substantial computational redundancy. Recent latent reasoning methods attempt to mitigate this by compressing reasoning processes into latent space, but often suffer from severe performance degradation due to the lack of appropriate compression guidance. In this study, we propose Rendered CoT-Guided variational Latent Reasoning (ReGuLaR), a simple yet novel latent learning paradigm resolving this issue. Fundamentally, we formulate latent reasoning within the Variational Auto-Encoding (VAE) framework, sampling the current latent reasoning state from the posterior distribution conditioned on previous ones. Specifically, when learning this variational latent reasoning model, we render explicit reasoning chains as images, from which we extract dense visual-semantic representations to regularize the posterior distribution, thereby achieving efficient compression with minimal information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReGuLaR significantly outperforms existing latent reasoning methods across both computational efficiency and reasoning effectiveness, and even surpasses CoT through multi-modal reasoning, providing a new and insightful solution to latent reasoning.

Abstract: Deep search agents powered by large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in multi-step retrieval, reasoning, and long-horizon task execution. However, their practical failures often stem from the lack of mechanisms to monitor and regulate reasoning and retrieval states as tasks evolve under uncertainty. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that human metacognition is hierarchically organized, integrating fast anomaly detection with selectively triggered, experience-driven reflection. In this work, we propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), a deep search framework augmented with an explicit hierarchical metacognitive monitoring mechanism. DS-MCM integrates a Fast Consistency Monitor, which performs lightweight checks on the alignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence, and a Slow Experience-Driven Monitor, which is selectively activated to guide corrective intervention based on experience memory from historical agent trajectories. By embedding monitoring directly into the reasoning-retrieval loop, DS-MCM determines both when intervention is warranted and how corrective actions should be informed by prior experience. Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that DS-MCM consistently improves performance and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23188v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Network analysis and link prediction in competitive women's basketball</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23193</link><description>arXiv:2601.23193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network structure and its role in prediction are examined in competitive basketball at the team and player levels. Adversarial game outcome networks from NCAA Division I women's basketball from 2021 to 2024 are used to compute the common out-neighbor score and PageRank, which are combined into a low-key leader strength that identifies competitors influential through structural similarity despite relatively low centrality. This measure is related to changes in NCAA NET rankings by grouping teams into quantiles and comparing average rank changes across seasons for both previous-to-current and current-to-next transitions. Link prediction is then studied using node2vec embeddings across three interaction settings. For NCAA regular-season game networks, cosine similarity between team embeddings is used in a logistic regression model to predict March Madness matchups. For WNBA shot-blocking networks, future directed blocking interactions are predicted via logistic regression on concatenated source-target player embeddings. For WNBA passing networks, region embeddings learned from first-quarter passes are evaluated for their ability to predict subsequent passing connections. Across NCAA and WNBA settings, embedding-based models provide statistically significant evidence that higher-order network structure contains predictive signals for future interactions, while the passing experiment shows weaker predictive performance but yields interpretable similarity patterns consistent with passing feasibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23193v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Planar Graph Homomorphisms: A Dichotomy and a Barrier from Quantum Groups</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23198</link><description>arXiv:2601.23198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of counting (weighted) planar graph homomorphism problem $\tt{Pl\text{-}GH}(M)$ parametrized by an arbitrary symmetric non-negative real valued matrix $M$. For matrices with pairwise distinct diagonal values, we prove a complete dichotomy theorem: $\tt{Pl\text{-}GH}(M)$ is either polynomial-time tractable, or $\#$P-hard, according to a simple criterion. More generally, we obtain a dichotomy whenever every vertex pair of the graph represented by $M$ can be separated using some planar edge gadget.
  A key question in proving complexity dichotomies in the planar setting is the expressive power of planar edge gadgets. We build on the framework of Man\v{c}inska and Roberson to establish links between \textit{planar} edge gadgets and the theory of the \textit{quantum automorphism group} $\tt{Qut}(M)$. We show that planar edge gadgets that can separate vertex pairs of $M$ exist precisely when $\tt{Qut}(M)$ is \emph{trivial}, and prove that the problem of whether $\tt{Qut}(M)$ is trivial is undecidable. These results delineate the frontier for planar homomorphism counting problems and uncover intrinsic barriers to extending nonplanar reduction techniques to the planar setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23198v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Models for Patent Classification: Strengths, Trade-offs, and the Long Tail Effect</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23200</link><description>arXiv:2601.23200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patent classification into CPC codes underpins large scale analyses of technological change but remains challenging due to its hierarchical, multi label, and highly imbalanced structure. While pre Generative AI supervised encoder based models became the de facto standard for large scale patent classification, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) raise questions about whether they can provide complementary capabilities, particularly for rare or weakly represented technological categories. In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of encoder based classifiers (BERT, SciBERT, and PatentSBERTa) and open weight LLMs on a highly imbalanced benchmark dataset (USPTO 70k). We evaluate LLMs under zero shot, few shot, and retrieval augmented prompting, and further assess parameter efficient fine tuning of the best performing model. Our results show that encoder based models achieve higher aggregate performance, driven by strong results on frequent CPC subclasses, but struggle on rare ones. In contrast, LLMs achieve relatively higher performance on infrequent subclasses, often associated with early stage, cross domain, or weakly institutionalised technologies, particularly at higher hierarchical levels. These findings indicate that encoder based and LLM based approaches play complementary roles in patent classification. We additionally quantify inference time and energy consumption, showing that encoder based models are up to three orders of magnitude more efficient than LLMs. Overall, our results inform responsible patentometrics and technology mapping, and motivate hybrid classification approaches that combine encoder efficiency with the long tail coverage of LLMs under computational and environmental constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23200v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TSAQA: Time Series Analysis Question And Answering Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23204</link><description>arXiv:2601.23204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series data are integral to critical applications across domains such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and environmental science. While recent work has begun to explore multi-task time series question answering (QA), current benchmarks remain limited to forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. We introduce TSAQA, a novel unified benchmark designed to broaden task coverage and evaluate diverse temporal analysis capabilities. TSAQA integrates six diverse tasks under a single framework ranging from conventional analysis, including anomaly detection and classification, to advanced analysis, such as characterization, comparison, data transformation, and temporal relationship analysis. Spanning 210k samples across 13 domains, the dataset employs diverse formats, including true-or-false (TF), multiple-choice (MC), and a novel puzzling (PZ), to comprehensively assess time series analysis. Zero-shot evaluation demonstrates that these tasks are challenging for current Large Language Models (LLMs): the best-performing commercial LLM, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves an average score of only 65.08. Although instruction tuning boosts open-source performance: the best-performing open-source model, LLaMA-3.1-8B, shows significant room for improvement, highlighting the complexity of temporal analysis for LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23204v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-quality generation of dynamic game content via small language models: A proof of concept</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23206</link><description>arXiv:2601.23206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promise for dynamic game content generation, but they face critical barriers, including narrative incoherence and high operational costs. Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation. While local quality assessment remains an open question, our results demonstrate feasibility for real-time generation under typical game engine constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23206v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Execute Graph Algorithms Exactly with Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23207</link><description>arXiv:2601.23207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what graph neural networks can learn, especially their ability to learn to execute algorithms, remains a central theoretical challenge. In this work, we prove exact learnability results for graph algorithms under bounded-degree and finite-precision constraints. Our approach follows a two-step process. First, we train an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to execute the local instructions of a single node. Second, during inference, we use the trained MLP ensemble as the update function within a graph neural network (GNN). Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we show that local instructions can be learned from a small training set, enabling the complete graph algorithm to be executed during inference without error and with high probability. To illustrate the learning power of our setting, we establish a rigorous learnability result for the LOCAL model of distributed computation. We further demonstrate positive learnability results for widely studied algorithms such as message flooding, breadth-first and depth-first search, and Bellman-Ford.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating the Viability of Additive Models to Predict Task Completion Time for 3D Interactions in Augmented Reality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23209</link><description>arXiv:2601.23209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive models of interaction performance, such as the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM), are tools that allow designers to compare and optimize the performance of user interfaces by summing the predicted times for the atomic components of a specific interaction to predict the total time it would take to complete that interaction. There has been extensive work in creating such additive models for 2D interfaces, but this approach has rarely been explored for 3D user interfaces. We propose a KLM-style additive model, based on existing atomic task models in the literature, to predict task completion time for 3D interaction tasks. We performed two studies to evaluate the feasibility of this approach across multiple input modalities, with one study using a simple menu selection task and the other a more complex manipulation task. We found that several of the models from the literature predicted actual task performance with less than 20% error in both the menu selection and manipulation study. Overall, we found that additive models can predict both absolute and relative performance of input modalities with reasonable accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23209v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Systems Should be Treated as Principal-Agent Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23211</link><description>arXiv:2601.23211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a multi-agent systems setup in which a principal (a supervisor agent) assigns subtasks to specialized agents and aggregates their responses into a single system-level output. A core property of such systems is information asymmetry: agents observe task-specific information, produce intermediate reasoning traces, and operate with different context windows. In isolation, such asymmetry is not problematic, since agents report truthfully to the principal when incentives are fully aligned. However, this assumption breaks down when incentives diverge. Recent evidence suggests that LLM-based agents can acquire their own goals, such as survival or self-preservation, a phenomenon known as scheming, and may deceive humans or other agents. This leads to agency loss: a gap between the principal's intended outcome and the realized system behavior. Drawing on core ideas from microeconomic theory, we argue that these characteristics, information asymmetry and misaligned goals, are best studied through the lens of principal-agent problems. We explain why multi-agent systems, both human-to-LLM and LLM-to-LLM, naturally induce information asymmetry under this formulation, and we use scheming, where LLM agents pursue covert goals, as a concrete case study. We show that recently introduced terminology used to describe scheming, such as covert subversion or deferred subversion, corresponds to well-studied concepts in the mechanism design literature, which not only characterizes the problem but also prescribes concrete mitigation strategies. More broadly, we argue for applying tools developed to study human agent behavior to the analysis of non-human agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23211v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A complete characterisation of conditional entropies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23213</link><description>arXiv:2601.23213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropies are fundamental measures of uncertainty with central importance in information theory and statistics and applications across all the quantitative sciences. Under a natural set of operational axioms, the most general form of entropy is captured by the family of R\'enyi entropies, parameterized by a real number $\alpha$. Conditional entropy extends the notion of entropy by quantifying uncertainty from the viewpoint of an observer with access to potentially correlated side information. However, despite their significance and the emergence of various useful definitions, a complete characterization of measures of conditional entropy that satisfy a natural set of operational axioms has remained elusive. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of conditional entropy, defined through a set of axioms that are essential for any operationally meaningful definition: additivity for independent random variables, invariance under relabeling, and monotonicity under conditional mixing channels. We prove that the most general form of conditional entropy is captured by a family of measures that are exponential averages of R\'enyi entropies of the conditioned distribution and parameterized by a real parameter and a probability measure on the positive reals. Finally, we show that these quantities determine the rate of transformation under conditional mixing and provide a set of second laws of quantum thermodynamics with side information for states diagonal in the energy eigenbasis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23213v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tackling air quality with SAPIENS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23215</link><description>arXiv:2601.23215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution is a chronic problem in large cities worldwide and awareness is rising as the long-term health implications become clearer. Vehicular traffic has been identified as a major contributor to poor air quality. In a lot of cities the publicly available air quality measurements and forecasts are coarse-grained both in space and time. However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions. Using Partial Least Squares Regression, we predict pollution levels based on these newly defined traffic intensities. The model was optimised with various training samples to achieve the best predictive performance and gain insights into the relationship between pollutants and traffic. The workflow we have designed is straightforward and adaptable to other contexts, like other cities beyond the specifics of our dataset.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23215v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication against Communication and Sensing Eavesdropping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23216</link><description>arXiv:2601.23216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing privacy and communication confidentiality play fundamentally different but interconnected roles in adversarial wireless environments. Capturing this interplay within a single physical-layer framework is particularly challenging in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the same waveform simultaneously serves dual purposes. We study a secure ISAC system in which a monostatic transmitter simultaneously sends a confidential message to a legitimate receiver and senses an environmental state, while a passive adversary attempts both message decoding and state estimation. We partially characterize the fundamental trade-offs among three performance measures: the transmitter's secrecy rate, its detection exponent, and the adversary's detection exponent. Beyond the joint input distribution that governs overall performance, the trade-offs are further shaped by the transmitter's ability to extract keys via feedback and hide both the content and structure of the codewords via wiretap and resolvability codes. We derive an achievable region, and illustrate the resulting design trade-offs through a numerical example.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23216v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MonoScale: Scaling Multi-Agent System with Monotonic Improvement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23219</link><description>arXiv:2601.23219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have advanced rapidly, using a router to decompose tasks and delegate subtasks to specialized agents. A natural way to expand capability is to scale up the agent pool by continually integrating new functional agents or tool interfaces, but naive expansion can trigger performance collapse when the router cold-starts on newly added, heterogeneous, and unreliable agents. We propose MonoScale, an expansion-aware update framework that proactively generates a small set of agent-conditioned familiarization tasks, harvests evidence from both successful and failed interactions, and distills it into auditable natural-language memory to guide future routing. We formalize sequential augmentation as a contextual bandit and perform trust-region memory updates, yielding a monotonic non-decreasing performance guarantee across onboarding rounds. Experiments on GAIA and Humanity's Last Exam show stable gains as the agent pool grows, outperforming naive scale-up and strong-router fixed-pool baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Med-Scout: Curing MLLMs' Geometric Blindness in Medical Perception via Geometry-Aware RL Post-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23220</link><description>arXiv:2601.23220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)' linguistic prowess in medical diagnosis, we find even state-of-the-art MLLMs suffer from a critical perceptual deficit: geometric blindness. This failure to ground outputs in objective geometric constraints leads to plausible yet factually incorrect hallucinations, rooted in training paradigms that prioritize linguistic fluency over geometric fidelity. This paper introduces Med-Scout, a novel framework that "cures" this blindness via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that leverages the intrinsic geometric logic latent within unlabeled medical images. Instead of relying on costly expert annotations, Med-Scout derives verifiable supervision signals through three strategic proxy tasks: Hierarchical Scale Localization, Topological Jigsaw Reconstruction, and Anomaly Consistency Detection. To rigorously quantify this deficit, we present Med-Scout-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate geometric perception. Extensive evaluations show that Med-Scout significantly mitigates geometric blindness, outperforming leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs by over 40% on our benchmark. Furthermore, this enhanced geometric perception generalizes to broader medical understanding, achieving superior results on radiological and comprehensive medical VQA tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23220v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal Fair Aggregation of Crowdsourced Noisy Labels using Demographic Parity Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23221</link><description>arXiv:2601.23221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As acquiring reliable ground-truth labels is usually costly, or infeasible, crowdsourcing and aggregation of noisy human annotations is the typical resort. Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and corroborate the theoretical insights.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23221v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Region-Normalized DPO for Medical Image Segmentation under Noisy Judges</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23222</link><description>arXiv:2601.23222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While dense pixel-wise annotations remain the gold standard for medical image segmentation, they are costly to obtain and limit scalability. In contrast, many deployed systems already produce inexpensive automatic quality-control (QC) signals like model agreement, uncertainty measures, or learned mask-quality scores which can be used for further model training without additional ground-truth annotation. However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability. Across two medical datasets and multiple regimes, RN-DPO improves sustained performance and stabilizes preference-based fine-tuning, outperforming standard DPO and strong baselines without requiring additional pixel annotations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23222v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Video-o3: Native Interleaved Clue Seeking for Long Video Multi-Hop Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23224</link><description>arXiv:2601.23224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing multimodal large language models for long-video understanding predominantly rely on uniform sampling and single-turn inference, limiting their ability to identify sparse yet critical evidence amid extensive redundancy. We introduce Video-o3, a novel framework that supports iterative discovery of salient visual clues, fine-grained inspection of key segments, and adaptive termination once sufficient evidence is acquired. Technically, we address two core challenges in interleaved tool invocation. First, to mitigate attention dispersion induced by the heterogeneity of reasoning and tool-calling, we propose Task-Decoupled Attention Masking, which isolates per-step concentration while preserving shared global context. Second, to control context length growth in multi-turn interactions, we introduce a Verifiable Trajectory-Guided Reward that balances exploration coverage with reasoning efficiency. To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes. These results demonstrate Video-o3's strong multi-hop evidence-seeking and reasoning capabilities, and validate the effectiveness of native tool invocation in long-video scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23224v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agile Reinforcement Learning through Separable Neural Architecture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23225</link><description>arXiv:2601.23225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet the go-to function approximators - multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) - are often parameter-inefficient due to an imperfect inductive bias for the smooth structure of many value functions. This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although model compression techniques exist, they operate post-hoc and do not improve learning efficiency. Recent spline-based separable architectures - such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) - have been shown to offer parameter efficiency but are widely reported to exhibit significant computational overhead, especially at scale.
  In seeking to address these limitations, this work introduces SPAN (SPline-based Adaptive Networks), a novel function approximation approach to RL. SPAN adapts the low rank KHRONOS framework by integrating a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis. SPAN is evaluated across discrete (PPO) and high-dimensional continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings (Minari/D4RL). Empirical results demonstrate that SPAN achieves a 30-50% improvement in sample efficiency and 1.3-9 times higher success rates across benchmarks compared to MLP baselines. Furthermore, SPAN demonstrates superior anytime performance and robustness to hyperparameter variations, suggesting it as a viable, high performance alternative for learning intrinsically efficient policies in resource-limited settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23225v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Digital Twins in 3D IC Packaging: A Critical Review of Physics, Data, and Hybrid Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23226</link><description>arXiv:2601.23226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) pack-aging and heterogeneous integration have emerged as central pillars of contemporary semiconductor scaling. Yet, the multi-physics coupling inherent to stacked architectures manifesting as thermal hot spots, warpage-induced stresses, and interconnect aging demands monitoring and control capabilities that surpass traditional offline metrology. Although Digital Twin (DT) technology provides a principled route to real-time reliability management, the existing literature remains fragmented and frequently blurs the distinction between static multiphysics simulation workflows and truly dynamic, closed-loop twins. This critical review distinguishes itself by addressing these deficiencies through three specific contributions. First, we clarify the Digital Twin hierarchy to resolve terminological ambiguity between digital models, shadows, and twins. Second, we synthesize three foundational enabling technologies: (1) physics-based modeling, emphasizing the shift from computationally intensive finite-element analysis (FEA) to real-time surrogate models; (2) data-driven paradigms, highlighting virtual metrology (VM) for inferring latent metrics; and (3) in-situ sensing, the nervous system coupling the physical stack to its virtual counterpart. Third, beyond a descriptive survey, we propose a unified hybrid DT architecture that leverages physics-informed machine learning (e.g., PINNs) to reconcile data scarcity with latency constraints. Finally, we outline a standards-aligned roadmap incorporating IEEE 1451 and UCIe protocols to accelerate the transition from passive digital shadows to autonomous, self-optimizing Digital Twins for 3D IC manufacturing and field operation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23226v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Multiagent Systems with Process Rewards</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23228</link><description>arXiv:2601.23228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While multiagent systems have shown promise for tackling complex tasks via specialization, finetuning multiple agents simultaneously faces two key challenges: (1) credit assignment across agents, and (2) sample efficiency of expensive multiagent rollouts. In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Strongly Polynomial Time Complexity of Policy Iteration for $L_\infty$ Robust MDPs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23229</link><description>arXiv:2601.23229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a fundamental model in sequential decision making. Robust MDPs (RMDPs) extend this framework by allowing uncertainty in transition probabilities and optimizing against the worst-case realization of that uncertainty. In particular, $(s, a)$-rectangular RMDPs with $L_\infty$ uncertainty sets form a fundamental and expressive model: they subsume classical MDPs and turn-based stochastic games. We consider this model with discounted payoffs. The existence of polynomial and strongly-polynomial time algorithms is a fundamental problem for these optimization models. For MDPs, linear programming yields polynomial-time algorithms for any arbitrary discount factor, and the seminal work of Ye established strongly--polynomial time for a fixed discount factor. The generalization of such results to RMDPs has remained an important open problem. In this work, we show that a robust policy iteration algorithm runs in strongly-polynomial time for $(s, a)$-rectangular $L_\infty$ RMDPs with a constant (fixed) discount factor, resolving an important algorithmic question.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23229v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ShotFinder: Imagination-Driven Open-Domain Video Shot Retrieval via Web Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23232</link><description>arXiv:2601.23232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in information retrieval, yet existing research has mainly focused on text or static multimodal settings. Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges. These results reveal that open-domain video shot retrieval is still a critical capability that multimodal large models have yet to overcome.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23232v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sequence Diffusion Model for Temporal Link Prediction in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23233</link><description>arXiv:2601.23233v1 Announce Type: new

Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23233v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] YuriiFormer: A Suite of Nesterov-Accelerated Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23236</link><description>arXiv:2601.23236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variational framework that interprets transformer layers as iterations of an optimization algorithm acting on token embeddings. In this view, self-attention implements a gradient step of an interaction energy, while MLP layers correspond to gradient updates of a potential energy. Standard GPT-style transformers emerge as vanilla gradient descent on the resulting composite objective, implemented via Lie--Trotter splitting between these two energy functionals. This perspective enables principled architectural design using classical optimization ideas. As a proof of concept, we introduce a Nesterov-style accelerated transformer that preserves the same attention and MLP oracles. The resulting architecture consistently outperforms a nanoGPT baseline on TinyStories and OpenWebText, demonstrating that optimization-theoretic insights can translate into practical gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23236v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How well do generative models solve inverse problems?

Abstract: Generative learning generates high dimensional data based on low dimensional conditions, also called prompts. Therefore, generative learning algorithms are eligible for solving (Bayesian) inverse problems. In this article we compare a traditional Bayesian inverse approach based on a forward regression model and a prior sampled with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with three state of the art generative learning models, namely conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, Invertible Neural Networks and Conditional Flow Matching. We apply them to a problem of gas turbine combustor design where we map six independent design parameters to three performance labels. We propose several metrics for the evaluation of this inverse design approaches and measure the accuracy of the labels of the generated designs along with the diversity. We also study the performance as a function of the training dataset size. Our benchmark has a clear winner, as Conditional Flow Matching consistently outperforms all competing approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23238v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Iterated Local Model for tournaments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23246</link><description>arXiv:2601.23246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitivity is a central, generative principle in social and other complex networks, capturing the tendency for two nodes with a common neighbor to form a direct connection. We propose a new model for highly dense, complex networks based on transitivity, called the Iterated Local Model Tournament (ILMT). In ILMT, we iteratively apply transitivity to form new tournaments by cloning nodes and their adjacencies, and either preserving or reversing the orientation of existing arcs between clones. The resulting model generates tournaments with small diameters and high connectivity as observed in real-world complex networks. We analyze subtournaments or motifs in the ILMT model and their universality properties. For many parameter choices, the model generates sequences of quasirandom tournaments. We also study the graph-theoretic properties of ILMT tournaments, including their cop number, domination number, and chromatic number. We finish with a set of open problems and variants of the ILMT model for oriented graphs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23246v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structured Over Scale: Learning Spatial Reasoning from Educational Video</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23251</link><description>arXiv:2601.23251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on standard video understanding benchmarks yet fail systematically on simple reasoning tasks that preschool children can solve, including counting, spatial reasoning, and compositional understanding. We hypothesize that the pedagogically-structured content of educational videos provides an ideal training signal for improving these capabilities. We introduce DoraVQA, a dataset of 5,344 question-answer pairs automatically extracted from 8 seasons of Dora the Explorer with precise timestamp alignment. Each episode follows a consistent \textit{context-question-pause-answer} structure that creates a self-contained learning environment analogous to interactive tutoring. We fine-tune both Qwen2 and Qwen3 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leveraging the clear correctness signals and structured reasoning traces inherent in educational content. Despite training exclusively on 38 hours of children's educational videos, our approach achieves improvements of 8-14 points on DoraVQA and state-of-the-art 86.16\% on CVBench, with strong transfer to Video-MME and NExT-QA, demonstrating effective generalization from narrow pedagogical content to broad multimodal understanding. Through cross-domain benchmarks, we show that VLMs can perform tasks that require robust reasoning learned from structured educational content, suggesting that content structure matters as much as content scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23251v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training-Free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance in Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23253</link><description>arXiv:2601.23253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models suffer performance degradation under domain shift, limiting real-world applicability. Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues. Combined with dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement, it effectively recalibrates the model for novel visual contexts. Experiments across diverse datasets show that TaTa significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance in domain and cross-dataset generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23253v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GrepRAG: An Empirical Study and Optimization of Grep-Like Retrieval for Code Completion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23254</link><description>arXiv:2601.23254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repository-level code completion remains challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to cross-file dependencies and limited context windows. Prior work addresses this challenge using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks based on semantic indexing or structure-aware graph analysis, but these approaches incur substantial computational overhead for index construction and maintenance. Motivated by common developer workflows that rely on lightweight search utilities (e.g., ripgrep), we revisit a fundamental yet underexplored question: how far can simple, index-free lexical retrieval support repository-level code completion before more complex retrieval mechanisms become necessary? To answer this question, we systematically investigate lightweight, index-free, intent-aware lexical retrieval through extensive empirical analysis. We first introduce Naive GrepRAG, a baseline framework in which LLMs autonomously generate ripgrep commands to retrieve relevant context. Despite its simplicity, Naive GrepRAG achieves performance comparable to sophisticated graph-based baselines. Further analysis shows that its effectiveness stems from retrieving lexically precise code fragments that are spatially closer to the completion site. We also identify key limitations of lexical retrieval, including sensitivity to noisy matches from high-frequency ambiguous keywords and context fragmentation caused by rigid truncation boundaries. To address these issues, we propose GrepRAG, which augments lexical retrieval with a lightweight post-processing pipeline featuring identifier-weighted re-ranking and structure-aware deduplication. Extensive evaluation on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated demonstrates that GrepRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 7.04-15.58 percent relative improvement in code exact match (EM) over the best baseline on CrossCodeEval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23254v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Now You Hear Me: Audio Narrative Attacks Against Large Audio-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23255</link><description>arXiv:2601.23255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large audio-language models increasingly operate on raw speech inputs, enabling more seamless integration across domains such as voice assistants, education, and clinical triage. This transition, however, introduces a distinct class of vulnerabilities that remain largely uncharacterized. We examine the security implications of this modality shift by designing a text-to-audio jailbreak that embeds disallowed directives within a narrative-style audio stream. The attack leverages an advanced instruction-following text-to-speech (TTS) model to exploit structural and acoustic properties, thereby circumventing safety mechanisms primarily calibrated for text. When delivered through synthetic speech, the narrative format elicits restricted outputs from state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving a 98.26% success rate that substantially exceeds text-only baselines. These results highlight the need for safety frameworks that jointly reason over linguistic and paralinguistic representations, particularly as speech-based interfaces become more prevalent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23255v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation for Resolving Software Issues</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23257</link><description>arXiv:2601.23257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software issue resolution in large repositories is a long-range decision process: choices made during localization shape the space of viable edits, and missteps can compound into incorrect patches. Despite this, many LLM-based repair pipelines still operate in a reset-and-solve manner, producing fresh reasoning for every new issue instead of carrying forward what worked in past fixes. This is wasteful because repositories routinely contain earlier issues with overlapping structure, failure modes, or constraints, where prior repair experience could provide useful guidance. Existing approaches typically harvest this signal through forward-time trial procedures, such as repeated refinement or search, incurring high inference cost while still risking divergence from the eventual correct patch. We present an Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation(O-CRD) framework that uses resolved in-repository issues with verified patches as supervision. Starting from a historical fix, the method reconstructs a stage-wise repair trace backward from the verified outcome, then reuses the distilled guidance at inference time to steer file/function localization and patch synthesis, without fine-tuning or online search. On SWE-Bench Lite, this approach increases Pass@1 by 10.4% with GPT-4o, 8.6% with DeepSeek-V3, and 10.3% with GPT-5, indicating that outcome-conditioned reuse of verified repairs can replace costly forward exploration for software issue resolution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23257v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agnostic Language Identification and Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23258</link><description>arXiv:2601.23258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works on language identification and generation have established tight statistical rates at which these tasks can be achieved. These works typically operate under a strong realizability assumption: that the input data is drawn from an unknown distribution necessarily supported on some language in a given collection. In this work, we relax this assumption of realizability entirely, and impose no restrictions on the distribution of the input data. We propose objectives to study both language identification and generation in this more general "agnostic" setup. Across both problems, we obtain novel interesting characterizations and nearly tight rates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23258v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TEON: Tensorized Orthonormalization Beyond Layer-Wise Muon for Large Language Model Pre-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23261</link><description>arXiv:2601.23261v1 Announce Type: new

We evaluate our approach on two widely adopted architectures: GPT-style models, ranging from 130M to 774M parameters, and LLaMA-style models, ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. Experimental results show that TEON consistently improves training and validation perplexity across model scales and exhibits strong robustness under various approximate SVD schemes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23261v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Particle-Guided Diffusion Models for Partial Differential Equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23262</link><description>arXiv:2601.23262v1 Announce Type: new

To rigorously evaluate our framework, we introduce PaperBananaBench, comprising 292 test cases for methodology diagrams curated from NeurIPS 2025 publications, covering diverse research domains and illustration styles. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PaperBanana consistently outperforms leading baselines in faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics. We further show that our method effectively extends to the generation of high-quality statistical plots. Collectively, PaperBanana paves the way for the automated generation of publication-ready illustrations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23265v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IRL-DAL: Safe and Adaptive Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving via Energy-Guided Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23266</link><description>arXiv:2601.23266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel inverse reinforcement learning framework using a diffusion-based adaptive lookahead planner (IRL-DAL) for autonomous vehicles. Training begins with imitation from an expert finite state machine (FSM) controller to provide a stable initialization. Environment terms are combined with an IRL discriminator signal to align with expert goals. Reinforcement learning (RL) is then performed with a hybrid reward that combines diffuse environmental feedback and targeted IRL rewards. A conditional diffusion model, which acts as a safety supervisor, plans safe paths. It stays in its lane, avoids obstacles, and moves smoothly. Then, a learnable adaptive mask (LAM) improves perception. It shifts visual attention based on vehicle speed and nearby hazards. After FSM-based imitation, the policy is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Training is run in the Webots simulator with a two-stage curriculum. A 96\% success rate is reached, and collisions are reduced to 0.05 per 1k steps, marking a new benchmark for safe navigation. By applying the proposed approach, the agent not only drives in lane but also handles unsafe conditions at an expert level, increasing robustness.We make our code publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TCBench: A Benchmark for Tropical Cyclone Track and Intensity Forecasting at the Global Scale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23268</link><description>arXiv:2601.23268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TCBench is a benchmark for evaluating global, short to medium-range (1-5 days) forecasts of tropical cyclone (TC) track and intensity. To allow a fair and model-agnostic comparison, TCBench builds on the IBTrACS observational dataset and formulates TC forecasting as predicting the time evolution of an existing tropical system conditioned on its initial position and intensity. TCBench includes state-of-the-art dynamical (TIGGE) and neural weather models (AIFS, Pangu-Weather, FourCastNet v2, GenCast). If not readily available, baseline tracks are consistently derived from model outputs using the TempestExtremes library. For evaluation, TCBench provides deterministic and probabilistic storm-following metrics. On 2023 test cases, neural weather models skillfully forecast TC tracks, while skillful intensity forecasts require additional steps such as post-processing. Designed for accessibility, TCBench helps AI practitioners tackle domain-relevant TC challenges and equips tropical meteorologists with data-driven tools and workflows to improve prediction and TC process understanding. By lowering barriers to reproducible, process-aware evaluation of extreme events, TCBench aims to democratize data-driven TC forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23268v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rank Reduction AutoEncoders for Mechanical Design: Advancing Novel and Efficient Data-Driven Topology Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23269</link><description>arXiv:2601.23269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a data-driven framework for fast forward and inverse analysis in topology optimization (TO) by combining Rank Reduction Autoencoders (RRAEs) with neural latent-space mappings. The methodology targets the efficient approximation of the relationship between optimized geometries and their corresponding mechanical responses or Quantity of Interest (QoI), with a particular focus on compliance-minimized linear elastic structures. High-dimensional TO results are first compressed using RRAEs, which encode the data into a low-rank approximation via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), obtained in this sense the most important features that approximate the data. Separate RRAE models are trained for geometry and for different types of QoIs, including scalar metrics, one-dimensional stress fields, and full two-dimensional von Mises stress distributions. The resulting low-dimensional latent coefficients of the latent space are then related through multilayer perceptrons to address both direct problems -- predicting structural responses from geometry -- and inverse problems -- recovering geometries from prescribed performance targets. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a benchmark TO problem based on a half MBB beam, using datasets generated via density-based Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) optimization. Numerical results show that the framework enables accurate and computationally efficient surrogate models, with increasing robustness and fidelity as richer QoIs are considered. The methodology also provides a foundation for generative mechanical design by enabling the synthesis of new geometries and responses through latent-space exploration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23269v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UPA: Unsupervised Prompt Agent via Tree-Based Search and Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23273</link><description>arXiv:2601.23273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt agents have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for automated prompt optimization, framing refinement as a sequential decision-making problem over a structured prompt space. While this formulation enables the use of advanced planning algorithms, these methods typically assume access to supervised reward signals, which are often unavailable in practical scenarios. In this work, we propose UPA, an Unsupervised Prompt Agent that realizes structured search and selection without relying on supervised feedback. Specifically, during search, UPA iteratively constructs an evolving tree structure to navigate the prompt space, guided by fine-grained and order-invariant pairwise comparisons from Large Language Models (LLMs). Crucially, as these local comparisons do not inherently yield a consistent global scale, we decouple systematic prompt exploration from final selection, introducing a two-stage framework grounded in the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model. This framework first performs path-wise Bayesian aggregation of local comparisons to filter candidates under uncertainty, followed by global tournament-style comparisons to infer latent prompt quality and identify the optimal prompt. Experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that UPA consistently outperforms existing prompt optimization methods, showing that agent-style optimization remains highly effective even in fully unsupervised settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23273v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FOCUS: DLLMs Know How to Tame Their Compute Bound</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23278</link><description>arXiv:2601.23278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) offer a compelling alternative to Auto-Regressive models, but their deployment is constrained by high decoding cost. In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks. The FOCUS system is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/sands-lab/FOCUS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23278v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoupled Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems on Function Spaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23280</link><description>arXiv:2601.23280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a data-efficient, physics-aware generative framework in function space for inverse PDE problems. Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23280v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] User Prompting Strategies and Prompt Enhancement Methods for Open-Set Object Detection in XR Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23281</link><description>arXiv:2601.23281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-set object detection (OSOD) localizes objects while identifying and rejecting unknown classes at inference. While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence. Based on the findings, we propose several prompting strategies and prompt enhancement methods for OSOD models in XR environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23281v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] End-to-end Optimization of Belief and Policy Learning in Shared Autonomy Paradigms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23285</link><description>arXiv:2601.23285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared autonomy systems require principled methods for inferring user intent and determining appropriate assistance levels. This is a central challenge in human-robot interaction, where systems must be successful while being mindful of user agency. Previous approaches relied on static blending ratios or separated goal inference from assistance arbitration, leading to suboptimal performance in unstructured environments. We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints. We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control. Our results confirmed that integrated optimization is most beneficial in complex, goal-ambiguous scenarios, and is generalizable across robotic domains requiring goal-directed assistance, advancing the SOTA for adaptive shared autonomy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VideoGPA: Distilling Geometry Priors for 3D-Consistent Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23286</link><description>arXiv:2601.23286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent video diffusion models (VDMs) produce visually impressive results, they fundamentally struggle to maintain 3D structural consistency, often resulting in object deformation or spatial drift. We hypothesize that these failures arise because standard denoising objectives lack explicit incentives for geometric coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference Alignment), a data-efficient self-supervised framework that leverages a geometry foundation model to automatically derive dense preference signals that guide VDMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This approach effectively steers the generative distribution toward inherent 3D consistency without requiring human annotations. VideoGPA significantly enhances temporal stability, physical plausibility, and motion coherence using minimal preference pairs, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23286v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smart Routing with Precise Link Estimation: DSEE-Based Anypath Routing for Reliable Wireless Networking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10377</link><description>arXiv:2405.10377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dynamic and resource-constrained environments, such as multi-hop wireless mesh networks, traditional routing protocols often falter by relying on predetermined paths that prove ineffective in unpredictable link conditions. Shortest Anypath routing offers a solution by adapting routing decisions based on real-time link conditions. However, the effectiveness of such routing is fundamentally dependent on the quality and reliability of the available links, and predicting these variables with certainty is challenging. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the Deterministic Sequencing of Exploration and Exploitation (DSEE), a multi-armed bandit algorithm, to address the need for accurate and real-time estimation of link delivery probabilities. This approach augments the reliability and resilience of the Shortest Anypath routing in the face of fluctuating link conditions. By coupling DSEE with Anypath routing, this algorithm continuously learns and ensures accurate delivery probability estimation and selects the most suitable way to efficiently route packets while maintaining a provable near-logarithmic regret bound. We also theoretically prove that our proposed scheme offers better regret scaling with respect to the network size than the previously proposed Thompson Sampling-based Opportunistic Routing (TSOR).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.10377v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Lightweight Unrolled Network for High Dynamic Range Modulo Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12526</link><description>arXiv:2601.12526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modulo-Imaging (MI) offers a promising alternative for expanding the dynamic range of images by resetting the signal intensity when it reaches the saturation level. Subsequently, high-dynamic range (HDR) modulo imaging requires a recovery process to obtain the HDR image. MI is a non-convex and ill-posed problem where recent recovery networks suffer in high-noise scenarios. In this work, we formulate the HDR reconstruction task as an optimization problem that incorporates a deep prior and subsequently unrolls it into an optimization-inspired deep neural network. The network employs a lightweight convolutional denoiser for fast inference with minimal computational overhead, effectively recovering intensity values while mitigating noise. Moreover, we introduce the Scaling Equivariance term that facilitates self-supervised fine-tuning, thereby enabling the model to adapt to new modulo images that fall outside the original training distribution. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art recovery algorithms in terms of performance and quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12526v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniFinEval: Towards Unified Evaluation of Financial Multimodal Models across Text, Images and Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22162</link><description>arXiv:2601.22162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models are playing an increasingly significant role in empowering the financial domain, however, the challenges they face, such as multimodal and high-density information and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, go beyond the evaluation scope of existing multimodal benchmarks. To address this gap, we propose UniFinEval, the first unified multimodal benchmark designed for high-information-density financial environments, covering text, images, and videos. UniFinEval systematically constructs five core financial scenarios grounded in real-world financial systems: Financial Statement Auditing, Company Fundamental Reasoning, Industry Trend Insights, Financial Risk Sensing, and Asset Allocation Analysis. We manually construct a high-quality dataset consisting of 3,767 question-answer pairs in both chinese and english and systematically evaluate 10 mainstream MLLMs under Zero-Shot and CoT settings. Results show that Gemini-3-pro-preview achieves the best overall performance, yet still exhibits a substantial gap compared to financial experts. Further error analysis reveals systematic deficiencies in current models. UniFinEval aims to provide a systematic assessment of MLLMs' capabilities in fine-grained, high-information-density financial environments, thereby enhancing the robustness of MLLMs applications in real-world financial scenarios.

Abstract: Algorithmic stablecoins promise decentralized monetary stability by maintaining a target peg through programmatic reserve management. Yet, their reserve controllers remain vulnerable to regime-blind optimization, calibrating risk parameters on fair-weather data while ignoring tail events that precipitate cascading failures. The March 2020 Black Thursday collapse, wherein MakerDAO's collateral auctions yielded $8.3M in losses and a 15% peg deviation, exposed a critical gap: existing models like SAS systematically omit extreme volatility regimes from covariance estimates, producing allocations optimal in expectation but catastrophic under adversarial stress.
  We present MVF-Composer, a trust-weighted Mean-Variance Frontier reserve controller incorporating a novel Stress Harness for risk-state estimation. Our key insight is deploying multi-agent simulations as adversarial stress-testers: heterogeneous agents (traders, liquidity providers, attackers) execute protocol actions under crisis scenarios, exposing reserve vulnerabilities before they manifest on-chain. We formalize a trust-scoring mechanism T: A -&gt; [0,1] that down-weights signals from agents exhibiting manipulative behavior, ensuring the risk-state estimator remains robust to signal injection and Sybil attacks.
  Across 1,200 randomized scenarios with injected Black-Swan shocks (10% collateral drawdown, 50% sentiment collapse, coordinated redemption attacks), MVF-Composer reduces peak peg deviation by 57% and mean recovery time by 3.1x relative to SAS baselines. Ablation studies confirm the trust layer accounts for 23% of stability gains under adversarial conditions, achieving 72% adversarial agent detection. Our system runs on commodity hardware, requires no on-chain oracles beyond standard price feeds, and provides a reproducible framework for stress-testing DeFi reserve policies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22168v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SCENE: Semantic-aware Codec Enhancement with Neural Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22189</link><description>arXiv:2601.22189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compression artifacts from standard video codecs often degrade perceptual quality. We propose a lightweight, semantic-aware pre-processing framework that enhances perceptual fidelity by selectively addressing these distortions. Our method integrates semantic embeddings from a vision-language model into an efficient convolutional architecture, prioritizing the preservation of perceptually significant structures. The model is trained end-to-end with a differentiable codec proxy, enabling it to mitigate artifacts from various standard codecs without modifying the existing video pipeline. During inference, the codec proxy is discarded, and SCENE operates as a standalone pre-processor, enabling real-time performance. Experiments on high-resolution benchmarks show improved performance over baselines in both objective (MS-SSIM) and perceptual (VMAF) metrics, with notable gains in preserving detailed textures within salient regions. Our results show that semantic-guided, codec-aware pre-processing is an effective approach for enhancing compressed video streams.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22189v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Benign Overfitting (ABO): Overparameterized RLS for Online Learning in Non-stationary Time-series</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22200</link><description>arXiv:2601.22200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overparameterized models have recently challenged conventional learning theory by exhibiting improved generalization beyond the interpolation limit, a phenomenon known as benign overfitting. This work introduces Adaptive Benign Overfitting (ABO), extending the recursive least-squares (RLS) framework to this regime through a numerically stable formulation based on orthogonal-triangular updates. A QR-based exponentially weighted RLS (QR-EWRLS) algorithm is introduced, combining random Fourier feature mappings with forgetting-factor regularization to enable online adaptation under non-stationary conditions. The orthogonal decomposition prevents the numerical divergence associated with covariance-form RLS while retaining adaptability to evolving data distributions. Experiments on nonlinear synthetic time series confirm that the proposed approach maintains bounded residuals and stable condition numbers while reproducing the double-descent behavior characteristic of overparameterized models. Applications to forecasting foreign exchange and electricity demand show that ABO is highly accurate (comparable to baseline kernel methods) while achieving speed improvements of between 20 and 40 percent. The results provide a unified view linking adaptive filtering, kernel approximation, and benign overfitting within a stable online learning framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22200v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Survey on Semantic Communication for Vision: Categories, Frameworks, Enabling Techniques, and Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22202</link><description>arXiv:2601.22202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) emerges as a transformative paradigm for traffic-intensive visual data transmission, shifting focus from raw data to meaningful content transmission and relieving the increasing pressure on communication resources. However, to achieve SemCom, challenges are faced in accurate semantic quantization for visual data, robust semantic extraction and reconstruction under diverse tasks and goals, transceiver coordination with effective knowledge utilization, and adaptation to unpredictable wireless communication environments. In this paper, we present a systematic review of SemCom for visual data transmission (SemCom-Vision), wherein an interdisciplinary analysis integrating computer vision (CV) and communication engineering is conducted to provide comprehensive guidelines for the machine learning (ML)-empowered SemCom-Vision design. Specifically, this survey first elucidates the basics and key concepts of SemCom. Then, we introduce a novel classification perspective to categorize existing SemCom-Vision approaches as semantic preservation communication (SPC), semantic expansion communication (SEC), and semantic refinement communication (SRC) based on communication goals interpreted through semantic quantization schemes. Moreover, this survey articulates the ML-based encoder-decoder models and training algorithms for each SemCom-Vision category, followed by knowledge structure and utilization strategies. Finally, we discuss potential SemCom-Vision applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22202v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Conditional Computation: Retrieval-Augmented Genomic Foundation Models with Gengram</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22203</link><description>arXiv:2601.22203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current genomic foundation models (GFMs) rely on extensive neural computation to implicitly approximate conserved biological motifs from single-nucleotide inputs. We propose Gengram, a conditional memory module that introduces an explicit and highly efficient lookup primitive for multi-base motifs via a genomic-specific hashing scheme, establishing genomic "syntax". Integrated into the backbone of state-of-the-art GFMs, Gengram achieves substantial gains (up to 14%) across several functional genomics tasks. The module demonstrates robust architectural generalization, while further inspection of Gengram's latent space reveals the emergence of meaningful representations that align closely with fundamental biological knowledge. By establishing structured motif memory as a modeling primitive, Gengram simultaneously boosts empirical performance and mechanistic interpretability, providing a scalable and biology-aligned pathway for the next generation of GFMs. The code is available at https://github.com/zhejianglab/Genos, and the model checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/ZhejiangLab/Gengram.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22203v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transitive Sets of Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22205</link><description>arXiv:2601.22205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate MacNeish's conjecture (known to be false in general) in the setting of what we call "transitive" Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS). When we restrict our attention to "simply transitive" MOLS, we find that the conjecture holds. We provide some partial results towards the transitive case, as well as the outcome of a computer search, which introduces a new construction of MOLS. In particular, we were unable to find any transitive large (conjecture-violating) sets of MOLS in the literature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22205v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sylber 2.0: A Universal Syllable Embedding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22306</link><description>arXiv:2601.22306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling spoken language modeling requires speech tokens that are both efficient and universal. Recent work has proposed syllables as promising speech tokens at low temporal resolution, but existing models are constrained to English and fail to capture sufficient acoustic detail. To address this gap, we present Sylber 2.0, a self-supervised framework for coding speech at the syllable level that enables efficient temporal compression and high-fidelity reconstruction. Sylber 2.0 achieves a very low token frequency around 5 Hz, while retaining both linguistic and acoustic detail across multiple languages and expressive styles. Experiments show that it performs on par with previous models operating on high-frequency baselines. Furthermore, Sylber 2.0 enables efficient TTS modeling which can generate speech with competitive intelligibility and quality with SOTA models using only 72M parameters. Moreover, the universality of Sylber 2.0 provides more effective features for low resource ASR than previous speech coding frameworks. In sum, we establish an effective syllable-level abstraction for general spoken language.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22306v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dependence-Aware Label Aggregation for LLM-as-a-Judge via Ising Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22336</link><description>arXiv:2601.22336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale AI evaluation increasingly relies on aggregating binary judgments from $K$ annotators, including LLMs used as judges. Most classical methods, e.g., Dawid-Skene or (weighted) majority voting, assume annotators are conditionally independent given the true label $Y\in\{0,1\}$, an assumption often violated by LLM judges due to shared data, architectures, prompts, and failure modes. Ignoring such dependencies can yield miscalibrated posteriors and even confidently incorrect predictions. We study label aggregation through a hierarchy of dependence-aware models based on Ising graphical models and latent factors. For class-dependent Ising models, the Bayes log-odds is generally quadratic in votes; for class-independent couplings, it reduces to a linear weighted vote with correlation-adjusted parameters. We present finite-$K$ examples showing that methods based on conditional independence can flip the Bayes label despite matching per-annotator marginals. We prove separation results demonstrating that these methods remain strictly suboptimal as the number of judges grows, incurring nonvanishing excess risk under latent factors. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on three real-world datasets, demonstrating improved performance over the classical baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22336v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Amortized Simulation-Based Inference in Generalized Bayes via Neural Posterior Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22367</link><description>arXiv:2601.22367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Bayesian Inference (GBI) tempers a loss with a temperature $\beta&gt;0$ to mitigate overconfidence and improve robustness under model misspecification, but existing GBI methods typically rely on costly MCMC or SDE-based samplers and must be re-run for each new dataset and each $\beta$ value. We give the first fully amortized variational approximation to the tempered posterior family $p_\beta(\theta \mid x) \propto \pi(\theta)\,p(x \mid \theta)^\beta$ by training a single $(x,\beta)$-conditioned neural posterior estimator $q_\phi(\theta \mid x,\beta)$ that enables sampling in a single forward pass, without simulator calls or inference-time MCMC. We introduce two complementary training routes: (i) synthesize off-manifold samples $(\theta,x) \sim \pi(\theta)\,p(x \mid \theta)^\beta$ and (ii) reweight a fixed base dataset $\pi(\theta)\,p(x \mid \theta)$ using self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS). We show that the SNIS-weighted objective provides a consistent forward-KL fit to the tempered posterior with finite weight variance. Across four standard simulation-based inference (SBI) benchmarks, including the chaotic Lorenz-96 system, our $\beta$-amortized estimator achieves competitive posterior approximations in standard two-sample metrics, matching non-amortized MCMC-based power-posterior samplers over a wide range of temperatures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22367v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] It's all the (Exponential) Family: An Equivalence between Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Control Variates for Sketching Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22378</link><description>arXiv:2601.22378v1 Announce Type: cross

Experiments show the EM algorithm is faster and numerically stable compared to other root finding algorithms for the MLE for the bivariate Normal distribution, and we expect this to hold across distributions satisfying these conditions. We show how the EM algorithm leads to reproducibility for algorithms using MLE / CVE, and demonstrate how the EM algorithm leads to finding the MLE when the CV weights are known.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22378v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spectral Filtering for Learning Quantum Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22400</link><description>arXiv:2601.22400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning high-dimensional quantum systems is a fundamental challenge that notoriously suffers from the curse of dimensionality. We formulate the task of predicting quantum evolution in the linear response regime as a specific instance of learning a Complex-Valued Linear Dynamical System (CLDS) with sector-bounded eigenvalues -- a setting that also encompasses modern Structured State Space Models (SSMs). While traditional system identification attempts to reconstruct full system matrices (incurring exponential cost in the Hilbert dimension), we propose Quantum Spectral Filtering, a method that shifts the goal to improper dynamic learning. Leveraging the optimal concentration properties of the Slepian basis, we prove that the learnability of such systems is governed strictly by an effective quantum dimension $k^*$, determined by the spectral bandwidth and memory horizon. This result establishes that complex-valued LDSs can be learned with sample and computational complexity independent of the ambient state dimension, provided their spectrum is bounded.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22400v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Minimal-Action Discrete Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching for Peptide Sequence Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22408</link><description>arXiv:2601.22408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling of peptide sequences requires navigating a discrete and highly constrained space in which many intermediate states are chemically implausible or unstable. Existing discrete diffusion and flow-based methods rely on reversing fixed corruption processes or following prescribed probability paths, which can force generation through low-likelihood regions and require countless sampling steps. We introduce Minimal-action discrete Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (MadSBM), a rate-based generative framework for peptide design that formulates generation as a controlled continuous-time Markov process on the amino-acid edit graph. To yield probability trajectories that remain near high-likelihood sequence neighborhoods throughout generation, MadSBM 1) defines generation relative to a biologically informed reference process derived from pre-trained protein language model logits and 2) learns a time-dependent control field that biases transition rates to produce low-action transport paths from a masked prior to the data distribution. We finally introduce guidance to the MadSBM sampling procedure towards a specific functional objective, expanding the design space of therapeutic peptides; to our knowledge, this represents the first-ever application of discrete classifier guidance to Schr\"odinger bridge-based generative models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22408v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the computability of cofinal Fra\"iss\'e limits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22435</link><description>arXiv:2601.22435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any collection of finite structures closed under isomorphism (i.e., an age) which has the Hereditary Property (HP), the Joint Embedding Property (JEP), and the Cofinal Amalgamation Property (CAP), there is a unique (up to isomorphism) countable structure which is cofinally ultrahomogeneous with the given age. Such a structure is called the cofinal Fra\"iss\'e limit of the age.
  In this paper, we consider the computational strength needed to construct the cofinal Fra\"iss\'e limit of a computable age. We show that this construction can always be done using the oracle 0''', and that there are ages that require 0''.
  In contrast, we show that if one assumes the strengthening of (CAP) known as the Amalgamation Property (AP), then the resulting limit, called the Fra\"iss\'e limit, can be constructed from the age using 0'. Our results therefore show that the more general case of cofinal Fra\"iss\'e limits requires greater computational strength than Fra\"iss\'e limits.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22435v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simulation-based Bayesian inference with ameliorative learned summary statistics -- Part I</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22441</link><description>arXiv:2601.22441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper, which is Part 1 of a two-part paper series, considers a simulation-based inference with learned summary statistics, in which such a learned summary statistic serves as an empirical-likelihood with ameliorative effects in the Bayesian setting, when the exact likelihood function associated with the observation data and the simulation model is difficult to obtain in a closed form or computationally intractable. In particular, a transformation technique which leverages the Cressie-Read discrepancy criterion under moment restrictions is used for summarizing the learned statistics between the observation data and the simulation outputs, while preserving the statistical power of the inference. Here, such a transformation of data-to-learned summary statistics also allows the simulation outputs to be conditioned on the observation data, so that the inference task can be performed over certain sample sets of the observation data that are considered as an empirical relevance or believed to be particular importance. Moreover, the simulation-based inference framework discussed in this paper can be extended further, and thus handling weakly dependent observation data. Finally, we remark that such an inference framework is suitable for implementation in distributed computing, i.e., computational tasks involving both the data-to-learned summary statistics and the Bayesian inferencing problem can be posed as a unified distributed inference problem that will exploit distributed optimization and MCMC algorithms for supporting large datasets associated with complex simulation models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22441v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI Decodes Historical Chinese Archives to Reveal Lost Climate History</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22458</link><description>arXiv:2601.22458v1 Announce Type: cross

Applied to historical Chinese archives, it produces the sub-annual precipitation reconstruction for southeastern China over the period 1368-1911 AD. Our reconstruction not only quantifies iconic extremes like the Ming Dynasty's Great Drought but also, crucially, maps the full spatial and seasonal structure of El Ni$\~n$o influence on precipitation in this region over five centuries, revealing dynamics inaccessible in shorter modern records. Our methodology and high-resolution climate dataset are directly applicable to climate science and have broader implications for the historical and social sciences.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22458v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the undecidability of quantum channel capacities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22471</link><description>arXiv:2601.22471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important distinction in our understanding of capacities of classical versus quantum channels is marked by the following question: is there an algorithm which can compute (or even efficiently compute) the capacity? While there is overwhelming evidence suggesting that quantum channel capacities may be uncomputable, a formal proof of any such statement is elusive. We initiate the study of the hardness of computing quantum channel capacities. We show that, for a general quantum channel, it is QMA-hard to compute its quantum capacity, and that the maximal-entanglement-assisted zero-error one-shot classical capacity is uncomputable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22471v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structural Conditions for Native CCZ Magic-State Fountains in qLDPC Codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22489</link><description>arXiv:2601.22489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes promise constant-rate, linear-distance families with bounded-weight checks, and recent work has realized transversal or constant-depth non-Clifford gates on various (often non-LDPC) codes. However, no explicit \emph{qubit} qLDPC family is known that simultaneously has constant rate, linear distance, bounded stabilizer weight, and a native \emph{magic-state fountain} that prepares many non-Clifford resource states in constant depth.
  We take a structural approach and identify coding-theoretic conditions under which a CSS qLDPC family necessarily supports a constant-depth $\CCZ$ magic-state fountain. The key ingredients are: (i) an algebraic notion of \emph{magic-friendly triples} of $X$-type logical operators, defined by pairwise orthogonality and a triple-overlap form controlling diagonal $\CCZ$ phases, and (ii) a 3-uniform hypergraph model of physical $\CCZ$ circuits combined with a packing lemma that turns large collections of such triples with bounded overlaps into bounded-degree hypergraphs.
  Our main theorem shows that if a CSS code family on $n$ qubits admits $\Omega(n^{1+\gamma})$ magic-friendly triples whose supports have bounded per-qubit participation, then there exists a constant-depth circuit of physical $\CCZ$ gates implementing $\Omega(n^{\gamma})$ logical $\CCZ$ gates in parallel while preserving distance up to a constant factor. For asymptotically good qLDPC families such as quantum Tanner codes, this reduces the existence of a native $\CCZ$ magic-state fountain to a concrete combinatorial problem about counting and distributing magic-friendly triples in the logical $X$ space.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22489v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Corrected Samplers for Discrete Flow Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22519</link><description>arXiv:2601.22519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete flow models (DFMs) have been proposed to learn the data distribution on a finite state space, offering a flexible framework as an alternative to discrete diffusion models. A line of recent work has studied samplers for discrete diffusion models, such as tau-leaping and Euler solver. However, these samplers require a large number of iterations to control discretization error, since the transition rates are frozen in time and evaluated at the initial state within each time interval. Moreover, theoretical results for these samplers often require boundedness conditions of the transition rate or they focus on a specific type of source distributions. To address those limitations, we establish non-asymptotic discretization error bounds for those samplers without any restriction on transition rates and source distributions, under the framework of discrete flow models. Furthermore, by analyzing a one-step lower bound of the Euler sampler, we propose two corrected samplers: \textit{time-corrected sampler} and \textit{location-corrected sampler}, which can reduce the discretization error of tau-leaping and Euler solver with almost no additional computational cost. We rigorously show that the location-corrected sampler has a lower iteration complexity than existing parallel samplers. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by demonstrating improved generation quality and reduced inference time on both simulation and text-to-image generation tasks.

Abstract: Endoscopic image analysis is vital for colorectal cancer screening, yet real-world conditions often suffer from lens fogging, motion blur, and specular highlights, which severely compromise automated polyp detection. We propose EndoCaver, a lightweight transformer with a unidirectional-guided dual-decoder architecture, enabling joint multi-task capability for image deblurring and segmentation while significantly reducing computational complexity and model parameters. Specifically, it integrates a Global Attention Module (GAM) for cross-scale aggregation, a Deblurring-Segmentation Aligner (DSA) to transfer restoration cues, and a cosine-based scheduler (LoCoS) for stable multi-task optimisation. Experiments on the Kvasir-SEG dataset show that EndoCaver achieves 0.922 Dice on clean data and 0.889 under severe image degradation, surpassing state-of-the-art methods while reducing model parameters by 90%. These results demonstrate its efficiency and robustness, making it well-suited for on-device clinical deployment.

Abstract: This work proposes Bonnet, an ultra-fast sparse-volume pipeline for whole-body bone segmentation from CT scans. Accurate bone segmentation is important for surgical planning and anatomical analysis, but existing 3D voxel-based models such as nnU-Net and STU-Net require heavy computation and often take several minutes per scan, which limits time-critical use. The proposed Bonnet addresses this by integrating a series of novel framework components including HU-based bone thresholding, patch-wise inference with a sparse spconv-based U-Net, and multi-window fusion into a full-volume prediction. Trained on TotalSegmentator and evaluated without additional tuning on RibSeg, CT-Pelvic1K, and CT-Spine1K, Bonnet achieves high Dice across ribs, pelvis, and spine while running in only 2.69 seconds per scan on an RTX A6000. Compared to strong voxel baselines, Bonnet attains a similar accuracy but reduces inference time by roughly 25x on the same hardware and tiling setup. The toolkit and pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/HINTLab/Bonnet.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22576v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Efficient Algorithm for Thresholding Monte Carlo Tree Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22600</link><description>arXiv:2601.22600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Thresholding Monte Carlo Tree Search problem, in which, given a tree $\mathcal{T}$ and a threshold $\theta$, a player must answer whether the root node value of $\mathcal{T}$ is at least $\theta$ or not. In the given tree, `MAX' or `MIN' is labeled on each internal node, and the value of a `MAX'-labeled (`MIN'-labeled) internal node is the maximum (minimum) of its child values. The value of a leaf node is the mean reward of an unknown distribution, from which the player can sample rewards. For this problem, we develop a $\delta$-correct sequential sampling algorithm based on the Track-and-Stop strategy that has asymptotically optimal sample complexity. We show that a ratio-based modification of the D-Tracking arm-pulling strategy leads to a substantial improvement in empirical sample complexity, as well as reducing the per-round computational cost from linear to logarithmic in the number of arms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22600v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training Beyond Convergence: Grokking nnU-Net for Glioma Segmentation in Sub-Saharan MRI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22637</link><description>arXiv:2601.22637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gliomas are placing an increasingly clinical burden on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In the region, the median survival for patients remains under two years, and access to diagnostic imaging is extremely limited. These constraints highlight an urgent need for automated tools that can extract the maximum possible information from each available scan, tools that are specifically trained on local data, rather than adapted from high-income settings where conditions are vastly different. We utilize the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Africa 2025 Challenge dataset, an expert annotated collection of glioma MRIs. Our objectives are: (i) establish a strong baseline with nnUNet on this dataset, and (ii) explore whether the celebrated "grokking" phenomenon an abrupt, late training jump from memorization to superior generalization can be triggered to push performance without extra labels. We evaluate two training regimes. The first is a fast, budget-conscious approach that limits optimization to just a few epochs, reflecting the constrained GPU resources typically available in African institutions. Despite this limitation, nnUNet achieves strong Dice scores: 92.3% for whole tumor (WH), 86.6% for tumor core (TC), and 86.3% for enhancing tumor (ET). The second regime extends training well beyond the point of convergence, aiming to trigger a grokking-driven performance leap. With this approach, we were able to achieve grokking and enhanced our results to higher Dice scores: 92.2% for whole tumor (WH), 90.1% for tumor core (TC), and 90.2% for enhancing tumor (ET).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22637v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative and Nonparametric Approaches for Conditional Distribution Estimation: Methods, Perspectives, and Comparative Evaluations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22650</link><description>arXiv:2601.22650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inference of conditional distributions is a fundamental problem in statistics, essential for prediction, uncertainty quantification, and probabilistic modeling. A wide range of methodologies have been developed for this task. This article reviews and compares several representative approaches spanning classical nonparametric methods and modern generative models. We begin with the single-index method of Hall and Yao (2005), which estimates the conditional distribution through a dimension-reducing index and nonparametric smoothing of the resulting one-dimensional cumulative conditional distribution function. We then examine the basis-expansion approaches, including FlexCode (Izbicki and Lee, 2017) and DeepCDE (Dalmasso et al., 2020), which convert conditional density estimation into a set of nonparametric regression problems. In addition, we discuss two recent generative simulation-based methods that leverage modern deep generative architectures: the generative conditional distribution sampler (Zhou et al., 2023) and the conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (Fu et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025). A systematic numerical comparison of these approaches is provided using a unified evaluation framework that ensures fairness and reproducibility. The performance metrics used for the estimated conditional distribution include the mean-squared errors of conditional mean and standard deviation, as well as the Wasserstein distance. We also discuss their flexibility and computational costs, highlighting the distinct advantages and limitations of each approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22650v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spectral Gradient Descent Mitigates Anisotropy-Driven Misalignment: A Case Study in Phase Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22652</link><description>arXiv:2601.22652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral gradient methods, such as the Muon optimizer, modify gradient updates by preserving directional information while discarding scale, and have shown strong empirical performance in deep learning. We investigate the mechanisms underlying these gains through a dynamical analysis of a nonlinear phase retrieval model with anisotropic Gaussian inputs, equivalent to training a two-layer neural network with the quadratic activation and fixed second-layer weights. Focusing on a spiked covariance setting where the dominant variance direction is orthogonal to the signal, we show that gradient descent (GD) suffers from a variance-induced misalignment: during the early escaping stage, the high-variance but uninformative spike direction is multiplicatively amplified, degrading alignment with the true signal under strong anisotropy. In contrast, spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) removes this spike amplification effect, leading to stable alignment and accelerated noise contraction. Numerical experiments confirm the theory and show that these phenomena persist under broader anisotropic covariances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22652v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parametric vector flows for registration fields in bounded domains with applications to nonlinear interpolation of shock-dominated flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22712</link><description>arXiv:2601.22712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a registration procedure for parametric model order reduction (MOR) in two- and three-dimensional bounded domains. In the MOR framework, registration methods exploit solution snapshots to identify a parametric coordinate transformation that improves the approximation of the solution set through linear subspaces. For each training parameter, optimization-based (or variational) registration methods minimize a target function that measures the alignment of the coherent structures of interest (e.g., shocks, shear layers, cracks) for different parameter values, over a family of bijections of the computational domain $\Omega$. We consider diffeomorphisms $\Phi$ that are vector flows of given velocity fields $v$ with vanishing normal component on $\partial \Omega$; we rely on a sensor to extract appropriate point clouds from the solution snapshots and we develop an expectation-maximization procedure to simultaneously solve the point cloud matching problem and to determine the velocity $v$ (and thus the bijection $\Phi$); finally, we combine our registration method with the nonlinear interpolation technique of [Iollo, Taddei, J. Comput. Phys., 2022] to perform accurate interpolations of fluid dynamic fields in the presence of shocks. Numerical results for a two-dimensional inviscid transonic flow past a NACA airfoil and a three-dimensional viscous transonic flow past an ONERA M6 wing illustrate the many elements of the methodology and demonstrate the effectiveness of nonlinear interpolation for shock-dominated fields.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22712v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Profunctorial algebras</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22721</link><description>arXiv:2601.22721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a bicategorical generalization of Barr's landmark 1970 paper, in which he describes how to extend Set-monads to relations and uses this to characterize topological spaces as the relational algebras of the ultrafilter monad. With two-sided discrete fibrations playing the role of relations in a bicategory, we first characterize, in terms of exact squares, when pseudomonads on a bicategory extend to its bicategory of two-sided discrete fibrations. As a wide class of examples, we show that every Set-monad induces a pseudomonad on the 2-category of categories satisfying our criterion and thus extending to profunctors. Among these, we then focus on the ultracompletion pseudomonad, whose pseudoalgebras are ultracategories: we characterize the normalized lax algebras of its profunctorial extension as ultraconvergence spaces, a recently-introduced categorification of topological spaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22721v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Cross-Domain Graph Learning Protocol for Single-Step Molecular Geometry Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22723</link><description>arXiv:2601.22723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate molecular geometries are a prerequisite for reliable quantum-chemical predictions, yet density functional theory (DFT) optimization remains a major bottleneck for high-throughput molecular screening. Here we present GeoOpt-Net, a multi-branch SE(3)-equivariant geometry refinement network that predicts DFT-quality structures at the B3LYP/TZVP level of theory in a single forward pass starting from inexpensive initial conformers generated at a low-cost force-field level. GeoOpt-Net is trained using a two-stage strategy in which a broadly pretrained geometric representation is subsequently fine-tuned to approach B3LYP/TZVP-level accuracy, with theory- and basis-set-aware calibration enabled by a fidelity-aware feature modulation (FAFM) mechanism. Benchmarking against representative approaches spanning classical conformer generation (RDKit), semiempirical quantum methods (xTB), data-driven geometry refinement pipelines (Auto3D), and machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMA) on external drug-like molecules demonstrates that GeoOpt-Net achieves sub-milli-\AA{} all-atom RMSD with near-zero B3LYP/TZVP single-point energy deviations, indicating DFT-ready geometries that closely reproduce both structural and energetic references. Beyond geometric metrics, GeoOpt-Net generates initial guesses intrinsically compatible with DFT convergence criteria, yielding nonzero ``All-YES'' convergence rates (65.0\% under loose and 33.4\% under default thresholds), and substantially reducing re-optimization steps and wall-clock time. GeoOpt-Net further exhibits smooth and predictable energy scaling with molecular complexity while preserving key electronic observables such as dipole moments. Collectively, these results establish GeoOpt-Net as a scalable, physically consistent geometry refinement framework that enables efficient acceleration of DFT-based quantum-chemical workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22723v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Active Learning-Driven Lightweight YOLOv9: Enhancing Efficiency in Smart Agriculture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22732</link><description>arXiv:2601.22732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the demand for real-time detection of tomatoes and tomato flowers by agricultural robots deployed on edge devices in greenhouse environments. Under practical imaging conditions, object detection systems often face challenges such as large scale variations caused by varying camera distances, severe occlusion from plant structures, and highly imbalanced class distributions. These factors make conventional object detection approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets difficult to simultaneously achieve high detection accuracy and deployment efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes an active learning driven lightweight object detection framework, integrating data analysis, model design, and training strategy. First, the size distribution of objects in raw agricultural images is analyzed to redefine an operational target range, thereby improving learning stability under real-world conditions. Second, an efficient feature extraction module is incorporated to reduce computational cost, while a lightweight attention mechanism is introduced to enhance feature representation under multi-scale and occluded scenarios. Finally, an active learning strategy is employed to iteratively select high-information samples for annotation and training under a limited labeling budget, effectively improving the recognition performance of minority and small-object categories. Experimental results demonstrate that, while maintaining a low parameter count and inference cost suitable for edge-device deployment, the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of tomatoes and tomato flowers in raw images. Under limited annotation conditions, the framework achieves an overall detection accuracy of 67.8% mAP, validating its practicality and feasibility for intelligent agricultural applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22732v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synthetic Abundance Maps for Unsupervised Super-Resolution of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22755</link><description>arXiv:2601.22755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (HS-SISR) aims to enhance the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images to fully exploit their spectral information. While considerable progress has been made in this field, most existing methods are supervised and require ground truth data for training-data that is often unavailable in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised training framework for HS-SISR, based on synthetic abundance data. The approach begins by unmixing the hyperspectral image into endmembers and abundances. A neural network is then trained to perform abundance super-resolution using synthetic abundances only. These synthetic abundance maps are generated from a dead leaves model whose characteristics are inherited from the low-resolution image to be super-resolved. This trained network is subsequently used to enhance the spatial resolution of the original image's abundances, and the final super-resolution hyperspectral image is reconstructed by combining them with the endmembers. Experimental results demonstrate both the training value of the synthetic data and the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22755v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Matrix Completion Under Geometric Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22765</link><description>arXiv:2601.22765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The completion of a Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) from sparse and noisy observations is a fundamental challenge in signal processing, with applications in sensor network localization, acoustic room reconstruction, molecular conformation, and manifold learning. Traditional approaches, such as rank-constrained optimization and semidefinite programming, enforce geometric constraints but often struggle under sparse or noisy conditions. This paper introduces a hierarchical Bayesian framework that places structured priors directly on the latent point set generating the EDM, naturally embedding geometric constraints. By incorporating a hierarchical prior on latent point set, the model enables automatic regularization and robust noise handling. Posterior inference is performed using a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampler to handle coupled latent point posterior. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy compared to deterministic baselines in sparse regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22765v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GRANITE: A Generalized Regional Framework for Identifying Agreement in Feature-Based Explanations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22771</link><description>arXiv:2601.22771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature-based explanation methods aim to quantify how features influence the model's behavior, either locally or globally, but different methods often disagree, producing conflicting explanations. This disagreement arises primarily from two sources: how feature interactions are handled and how feature dependencies are incorporated. We propose GRANITE, a generalized regional explanation framework that partitions the feature space into regions where interaction and distribution influences are minimized. This approach aligns different explanation methods, yielding more consistent and interpretable explanations. GRANITE unifies existing regional approaches, extends them to feature groups, and introduces a recursive partitioning algorithm to estimate such regions. We demonstrate its effectiveness on real-world datasets, providing a practical tool for consistent and interpretable feature explanations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22771v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Streaming Speech Recognition with Decoder-Only Large Language Models and Latency Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22779</link><description>arXiv:2601.22779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated the potential of decoderonly large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, enabling streaming recognition within this framework remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a novel streaming ASR approach that integrates a read/write policy network with monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) to dynamically segment speech embeddings. These segments are interleaved with label sequences during training, enabling seamless integration with the LLM. During inference, the audio stream is buffered until the MoChA module triggers a read signal, at which point the buffered segment together with the previous token is fed into the LLM for the next token prediction. We also introduce a minimal-latency training objective to guide the policy network toward accurate segmentation boundaries. Furthermore, we adopt a joint training strategy in which a non-streaming LLM-ASR model and our streaming model share parameters. Experiments on the AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 Mandarin benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms recent streaming ASR baselines, achieving character error rates of 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively. The latency optimization results in a 62.5% reduction in average token generation delay with negligible impact on recognition accuracy</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22779v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Approximating $f$-Divergences with Rank Statistics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22784</link><description>arXiv:2601.22784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a rank-statistic approximation of $f$-divergences that avoids explicit density-ratio estimation by working directly with the distribution of ranks. For a resolution parameter $K$, we map the mismatch between two univariate distributions $\mu$ and $\nu$ to a rank histogram on $\{ 0, \ldots, K\}$ and measure its deviation from uniformity via a discrete $f$-divergence, yielding a rank-statistic divergence estimator. We prove that the resulting estimator of the divergence is monotone in $K$, is always a lower bound of the true $f$-divergence, and we establish quantitative convergence rates for $K\to\infty$ under mild regularity of the quantile-domain density ratio. To handle high-dimensional data, we define the sliced rank-statistic $f$-divergence by averaging the univariate construction over random projections, and we provide convergence results for the sliced limit as well. We also derive finite-sample deviation bounds along with asymptotic normality results for the estimator. Finally, we empirically validate the approach by benchmarking against neural baselines and illustrating its use as a learning objective in generative modelling experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22784v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CALM: Joint Contextual Acoustic-Linguistic Modeling for Personalization of Multi-Speaker ASR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22792</link><description>arXiv:2601.22792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CALM, a joint Contextual Acoustic-Linguistic Modeling framework for multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR). In personalized AI scenarios, the joint availability of acoustic and linguistic cues naturally motivates the integration of target-speaker conditioning with contextual biasing in overlapping conversations. CALM implements this integration in an end-to-end framework through speaker embedding-driven target-speaker extraction and dynamic vocabulary-based contextual biasing. We evaluate CALM on simulated English (LibriSpeechMix) and Japanese (Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese mixtures, CSJMix). On two-speaker mixtures, CALM reduces biased word error rate (B-WER) from 12.7 to 4.7 on LibriSpeech2Mix and biased character error rate (B-CER) from 16.6 to 8.4 on CSJMix2 (eval3), demonstrating the effectiveness of joint acoustic-linguistic modeling across languages. We additionally report results on the AMI corpus (IHM-mix condition) to validate performance on standardized speech mixtures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22792v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EmoShift: Lightweight Activation Steering for Enhanced Emotion-Aware Speech Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22873</link><description>arXiv:2601.22873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise and controllable emotional expression is crucial for producing natural and context-appropriate speech in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. However, many emotion-aware TTS systems, including large language model (LLM)-based designs, rely on scaling fixed emotion embeddings or external guidance, limiting their ability to model emotion-specific latent characteristics. To address this gap, we present EmoShift, a lightweight activation-steering framework incorporating a EmoSteer layer, which learns a steering vector for each target emotion in the output embedding space to capture its latent offset and maintain stable, appropriate expression across utterances and categories. With only 10M trainable parameters,less than 1/30 of full fine-tuning, EmoShift outperforms zero-shot and fully fine-tuned baselines in objective and subjective evaluations, enhancing emotional expressiveness while preserving naturalness and speaker similarity. Further analysis confirms the proposed EmoSteer layer's effectiveness and reveals its potential for controllable emotional intensity in speech synthesis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22873v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Development of Domain-Invariant Visual Enhancement and Restoration (DIVER) Approach for Underwater Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22878</link><description>arXiv:2601.22878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater images suffer severe degradation due to wavelength-dependent attenuation, scattering, and illumination non-uniformity that vary across water types and depths. We propose an unsupervised Domain-Invariant Visual Enhancement and Restoration (DIVER) framework that integrates empirical correction with physics-guided modeling for robust underwater image enhancement. DIVER first applies either IlluminateNet for adaptive luminance enhancement or a Spectral Equalization Filter for spectral normalization. An Adaptive Optical Correction Module then refines hue and contrast using channel-adaptive filtering, while Hydro-OpticNet employs physics-constrained learning to compensate for backscatter and wavelength-dependent attenuation. The parameters of IlluminateNet and Hydro-OpticNet are optimized via unsupervised learning using a composite loss function. DIVER is evaluated on eight diverse datasets covering shallow, deep, and highly turbid environments, including both naturally low-light and artificially illuminated scenes, using reference and non-reference metrics. While state-of-the-art methods such as WaterNet, UDNet, and Phaseformer perform reasonably in shallow water, their performance degrades in deep, unevenly illuminated, or artificially lit conditions. In contrast, DIVER consistently achieves best or near-best performance across all datasets, demonstrating strong domain-invariant capability. DIVER yields at least a 9% improvement over SOTA methods in UCIQE. On the low-light SeaThru dataset, where color-palette references enable direct evaluation of color restoration, DIVER achieves at least a 4.9% reduction in GPMAE compared to existing methods. Beyond visual quality, DIVER also improves robotic perception by enhancing ORB-based keypoint repeatability and matching performance, confirming its robustness across diverse underwater environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22878v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OneFlowSBI: One Model, Many Queries for Simulation-Based Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22951</link><description>arXiv:2601.22951v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Inference in non-linear continuous stochastic processes on trees is challenging, particularly when observations are sparse (leaf-only) and the topology is complex. Exact smoothing via Doob's $h$-transform is intractable for general non-linear dynamics, while particle-based methods degrade in high dimensions. We propose Neural Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (NBFFG), a unified framework for both discrete transitions and continuous diffusions. Our method constructs a variational posterior by leveraging an auxiliary linear-Gaussian process. This auxiliary process yields a closed-form backward filter that serves as a ``guide'', steering the generative path toward high-likelihood regions. We then learn a neural residual--parameterized as a normalizing flow or a controlled SDE--to capture the non-linear discrepancies. This formulation allows for an unbiased path-wise subsampling scheme, reducing the training complexity from tree-size dependent to path-length dependent. Empirical results show that NBFFG outperforms baselines on synthetic benchmarks, and we demonstrate the method on a high-dimensional inference task in phylogenetic analysis with reconstruction of ancestral butterfly wing shapes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23030v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Asymptotic Theory of Iterated Empirical Risk Minimization, with Applications to Active Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23031</link><description>arXiv:2601.23031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of iterated empirical risk minimization (ERM) procedures in which two successive ERMs are performed on the same dataset, and the predictions of the first estimator enter as an argument in the loss function of the second. This setting, which arises naturally in active learning and reweighting schemes, introduces intricate statistical dependencies across samples and fundamentally distinguishes the problem from classical single-stage ERM analyses. For linear models trained with a broad class of convex losses on Gaussian mixture data, we derive a sharp asymptotic characterization of the test error in the high-dimensional regime where the sample size and ambient dimension scale proportionally. Our results provide explicit, fully asymptotic predictions for the performance of the second-stage estimator despite the reuse of data and the presence of prediction-dependent losses. We apply this theory to revisit a well-studied pool-based active learning problem, removing oracle and sample-splitting assumptions made in prior work. We uncover a fundamental tradeoff in how the labeling budget should be allocated across stages, and demonstrate a double-descent behavior of the test error driven purely by data selection, rather than model size or sample count.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23031v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning-Based Signal Recovery in Nonlinear Systems with Spectrally Separated Interference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23076</link><description>arXiv:2601.23076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upper Mid-Band (FR3, 7-24 GHz) receivers for 6G must operate over wide bandwidths in dense spectral environments, making them particularly vulnerable to strong adjacent-band interference and front-end nonlinearities. While conventional linear receivers can suppress spectrally separated interferers under ideal hardware assumptions, receiver saturation and finite-resolution quantization cause nonlinear spectral leakage that severely degrades performance in practical wideband radios. We study the recovery of a desired signal from nonlinear receiver observations corrupted by a high-power out-of-band interferer. The receiver front-end is modeled as a smooth, memoryless nonlinearity followed by additive noise and optional quantization. To mitigate these nonlinear and quantization-induced distortions, we propose a learned multi-layer Vector Approximate Message Passing (LMLVAMP) algorithm that incorporates spectral priors with neural network based denoising. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains over conventional methods, particularly in high-interference regimes representative of FR3 coexistence scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23076v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vision-Language Controlled Deep Unfolding for Joint Medical Image Restoration and Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23103</link><description>arXiv:2601.23103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose VL-DUN, a principled framework for joint All-in-One Medical Image Restoration and Segmentation (AiOMIRS) that bridges the gap between low-level signal recovery and high-level semantic understanding. While standard pipelines treat these tasks in isolation, our core insight is that they are fundamentally synergistic: restoration provides clean anatomical structures to improve segmentation, while semantic priors regularize the restoration process. VL-DUN resolves the sub-optimality of sequential processing through two primary innovations. (1) We formulate AiOMIRS as a unified optimization problem, deriving an interpretable joint unfolding mechanism where restoration and segmentation are mathematically coupled for mutual refinement. (2) We introduce a frequency-aware Mamba mechanism to capture long-range dependencies for global segmentation while preserving the high-frequency textures necessary for restoration. This allows for efficient global context modeling with linear complexity, effectively mitigating the spectral bias of standard architectures. As a pioneering work in the AiOMIRS task, VL-DUN establishes a new state-of-the-art across multi-modal benchmarks, improving PSNR by 0.92 dB and the Dice coefficient by 9.76\%. Our results demonstrate that joint collaborative learning offers a superior, more robust solution for complex clinical workflows compared to isolated task processing.

Abstract: We study Sparse Signal Recovery (SSR) methods for multichannel imaging with compressed {forward and backward} operators that preserve reconstruction accuracy. We propose a Compressed Block-Convolutional (C-BC) measurement model based on a low-rank Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) decomposition that is analytically initialized from a low-rank factorization of physics-derived forward/backward operators in time delay-based measurements. We use Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to select a compact set of basis filters from the analytic model and compute linear mixing coefficients to approximate the full model. We consider the Learned Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (LISTA) network as a representative example for which the C-BC-LISTA extension is presented. In simulated multichannel ultrasound imaging across multiple Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs), C-BC-LISTA requires substantially fewer parameters and smaller model size than other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while improving reconstruction accuracy. In ablations over OMP, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based, and random initializations, OMP-initialized structured compression performs best, yielding the most efficient training and the best performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23148v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scale-Cascaded Diffusion Models for Super-Resolution in Medical Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23201</link><description>arXiv:2601.23201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been increasingly used as strong generative priors for solving inverse problems such as super-resolution in medical imaging. However, these approaches typically utilize a diffusion prior trained at a single scale, ignoring the hierarchical scale structure of image data. In this work, we propose to decompose images into Laplacian pyramid scales and train separate diffusion priors for each frequency band. We then develop an algorithm to perform super-resolution that utilizes these priors to progressively refine reconstructions across different scales. Evaluated on brain, knee, and prostate MRI data, our approach both improves perceptual quality over baselines and reduces inference time through smaller coarse-scale networks. Our framework unifies multiscale reconstruction and diffusion priors for medical image super-resolution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23201v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Random Matrix Theory of Masked Self-Supervised Regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23208</link><description>arXiv:2601.23208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of transformer models, masked self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a foundational training paradigm. A defining feature of masked SSL is that training aggregates predictions across many masking patterns, giving rise to a joint, matrix-valued predictor rather than a single vector-valued estimator. This object encodes how coordinates condition on one another and poses new analytical challenges. We develop a precise high-dimensional analysis of masked modeling objectives in the proportional regime where the number of samples scales with the ambient dimension. Our results provide explicit expressions for the generalization error and characterize the spectral structure of the learned predictor, revealing how masked modeling extracts structure from data. For spiked covariance models, we show that the joint predictor undergoes a Baik--Ben Arous--P\'ech\'e (BBP)-type phase transition, identifying when masked SSL begins to recover latent signals. Finally, we identify structured regimes in which masked self-supervised learning provably outperforms PCA, highlighting potential advantages of SSL objectives over classical unsupervised methods</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23208v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Disentangling multispecific antibody function with graph neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23212</link><description>arXiv:2601.23212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multispecific antibodies offer transformative therapeutic potential by engaging multiple epitopes simultaneously, yet their efficacy is an emergent property governed by complex molecular architectures. Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains. This work provides a robust benchmarking environment for disentangling the combinatorial complexity of multispecifics, accelerating the design of next-generation therapeutics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23212v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Solving Inverse Problems with Flow-based Models via Model Predictive Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23231</link><description>arXiv:2601.23231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models provide strong unconditional priors for inverse problems, but guiding their dynamics for conditional generation remains challenging. Recent work casts training-free conditional generation in flow models as an optimal control problem; however, solving the resulting trajectory optimisation is computationally and memory intensive, requiring differentiation through the flow dynamics or adjoint solves. We propose MPC-Flow, a model predictive control framework that formulates inverse problem solving with flow-based generative models as a sequence of control sub-problems, enabling practical optimal control-based guidance at inference time. We provide theoretical guarantees linking MPC-Flow to the underlying optimal control objective and show how different algorithmic choices yield a spectrum of guidance algorithms, including regimes that avoid backpropagation through the generative model trajectory. We evaluate MPC-Flow on benchmark image restoration tasks, spanning linear and non-linear settings such as in-painting, deblurring, and super-resolution, and demonstrate strong performance and scalability to massive state-of-the-art architectures via training-free guidance of FLUX.2 (32B) in a quantised setting on consumer hardware.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph Attention Network for Node Regression on Random Geometric Graphs with Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi contamination</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23239</link><description>arXiv:2601.23239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph attention networks (GATs) are widely used and often appear robust to noise in node covariates and edges, yet rigorous statistical guarantees demonstrating a provable advantage of GATs over non-attention graph neural networks~(GNNs) are scarce. We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: responses are generated from latent node-level covariates, but only noise-perturbed versions of the latent covariates are observed; and the sample graph is a random geometric graph created from the node covariates but contaminated by independent Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi edges. We propose and analyze a carefully designed, task-specific GAT that constructs denoised proxy features for regression. We prove that regressing the response variables on the proxies achieves lower error asymptotically in (a) estimating the regression coefficient compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator on the noisy node covariates, and (b) predicting the response for an unlabelled node compared to a vanilla graph convolutional network~(GCN) -- under mild growth conditions. Our analysis leverages high-dimensional geometric tail bounds and concentration for neighbourhood counts and sample covariances. We verify our theoretical findings through experiments on synthetically generated data. We also perform experiments on real-world graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in several node regression tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23239v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nested Slice Sampling: Vectorized Nested Sampling for GPU-Accelerated Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23252</link><description>arXiv:2601.23252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model comparison and calibrated uncertainty quantification often require integrating over parameters, but scalable inference can be challenging for complex, multimodal targets. Nested Sampling is a robust alternative to standard MCMC, yet its typically sequential structure and hard constraints make efficient accelerator implementations difficult. This paper introduces Nested Slice Sampling (NSS), a GPU-friendly, vectorized formulation of Nested Sampling that uses Hit-and-Run Slice Sampling for constrained updates. A tuning analysis yields a simple near-optimal rule for setting the slice width, improving high-dimensional behavior and making per-step compute more predictable for parallel execution. Experiments on challenging synthetic targets, high dimensional Bayesian inference, and Gaussian process hyperparameter marginalization show that NSS maintains accurate evidence estimates and high-quality posterior samples, and is particularly robust on difficult multimodal problems where current state-of-the-art methods such as tempered SMC baselines can struggle. An open-source implementation is released to facilitate adoption and reproducibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23252v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Denoising the Deep Sky: Physics-Based CCD Noise Formation for Astronomical Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23276</link><description>arXiv:2601.23276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical imaging remains noise-limited under practical observing constraints, while standard calibration pipelines mainly remove structured artifacts and leave stochastic noise largely unresolved. Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation. The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels. To obtain low-noise inputs for synthesis, we average multiple unregistered exposures to produce high-SNR bases. Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning. We further introduce a real-world dataset across multi-bands acquired with two twin ground-based telescopes, providing paired raw frames and instrument-pipeline calibrated frames, together with calibration data and stacked high-SNR bases for real-world evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23276v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Grounding Large Language Models in Interactive Environments with Online Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02662</link><description>arXiv:2302.02662v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works successfully leveraged Large Language Models' (LLM) abilities to capture abstract knowledge about world's physics to solve decision-making problems. Yet, the alignment between LLMs' knowledge and the environment can be wrong and limit functional competence due to lack of grounding. In this paper, we study an approach (named GLAM) to achieve this alignment through functional grounding: we consider an agent using an LLM as a policy that is progressively updated as the agent interacts with the environment, leveraging online Reinforcement Learning to improve its performance to solve goals. Using an interactive textual environment designed to study higher-level forms of functional grounding, and a set of spatial and navigation tasks, we study several scientific questions: 1) Can LLMs boost sample efficiency for online learning of various RL tasks? 2) How can it boost different forms of generalization? 3) What is the impact of online learning? We study these questions by functionally grounding several variants (size, architecture) of FLAN-T5.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2302.02662v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Cheeger Inequality for Size-Specific Conductance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11452</link><description>arXiv:2303.11452v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit long-tailed distributions, where a few dominant "Head" classes have abundant samples while most "Tail" classes are severely underrepresented, leading to biased learning and poor generalization for the Tail. We present a theoretical framework that reveals a previously undescribed connection between Long-Tailed Recognition (LTR) and Continual Learning (CL), the process of learning sequential tasks without forgetting prior knowledge. Our analysis demonstrates that, for models trained on imbalanced datasets, the weights converge to a bounded neighborhood of those trained exclusively on the Head, with the bound scaling as the inverse square root of the imbalance factor. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Continual Learning for Long-Tailed Recognition (CLTR), a principled approach that employs standard off-the-shelf CL methods to address LTR problems by sequentially learning Head and Tail classes without forgetting the Head. Our theoretical analysis further suggests that CLTR mitigates gradient saturation and improves Tail learning while maintaining strong Head performance. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100-LT, CIFAR10-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Caltech256 validate our theoretical predictions, achieving strong results across various LTR benchmarks. Our work bridges the gap between LTR and CL, providing a principled way to tackle imbalanced data challenges with standard existing CL strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2306.13275v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The complexity of solving a system of equations of the same degree</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03855</link><description>arXiv:2309.03855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many systems of interest in cryptography consist of equations of the same degree. Under the assumption that the degree of regularity is finite, we prove upper bounds on the degree of regularity of a system of equations of the same degree, with or without adding the field equations to the system. The bounds translate into upper bounds on the solving degree of the systems, and hence on the complexity of solving them via Gr\"obner bases methods. Our bounds depend on the number of equations in the system, the number of variables, and the degree of the equations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2309.03855v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring and Analyzing the Effect of Avatar's Realism on Anxiety of English as Second Language (ESL) Speakers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05126</link><description>arXiv:2311.05126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual avatars are increasingly used to support cross-cultural communication, yet their impact on communication anxiety among English as a Second Language (ESL) speakers remains underexplored. This study examines how avatar realism influences anxiety during English interactions between ESL speakers and native speakers. We conducted a controlled laboratory study in which Mandarin-speaking ESL participants engaged in guided one-on-one conversations under three visual representation conditions: live video, cartoon-like avatars, and realistic-like avatars. Anxiety was assessed using self-reported surveys and physiological signals, including electrodermal activity (EDA), electrocardiography (ECG), and photoplethysmography (PPG). The results show that increased visual realism does not correspond to a monotonic change in anxiety. Live video was the most preferred and was associated with the lowest self-reported anxiety. Cartoon-like avatars exhibited physiological anxiety levels comparable to live video and lower than realistic-like avatars, whereas realistic-like avatars elicited elevated anxiety across measures. These findings suggest that an effective avatar design for ESL communication should prioritize clarity of social signaling, reduced perceived social threat, and alignment between visual representation and interaction context, rather than visual realism alone.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2311.05126v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry-Enforced Quadratic Degradability Beyond Low Dimensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16312</link><description>arXiv:2401.16312v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate degradability provides a powerful framework for bounding the quantum and private capacities of noisy quantum channels in regimes where exact degradability fails. While generic low-noise channels exhibit a non-degradability parameter that decays as a fractional power of the noise strength, certain symmetric channels are known to display an enhanced quadratic suppression. In this work, we investigate the structural origin of this phenomenon through a family of high-dimensional, rotationally symmetric noise models constructed from angular momentum operators. We first establish that the pure noise component of these channels is maximally distinguishable from the identity channel in diamond norm, revealing a geometric orthogonality between signal and noise. Building on this structure, we construct an explicit symmetric degrading map and prove that the approximate degradability parameter scales quadratically with the noise parameter for all system dimensions. To clarify the mechanism behind this behavior, we identify algebraic conditions on the noise operators that guarantee the cancellation of leading-order non-degradability terms. These conditions apply not only to the rotationally symmetric model studied here, but also to a distinct family of high-dimensional depolarizing channels based on discrete unitary operator bases. Numerical evaluations of capacity lower bounds further illustrate the practical impact of the quadratic suppression. Together, these results demonstrate that enhanced approximate degradability arises from symmetry-induced orthogonality and invariance properties, rather than from low-dimensional or model-specific effects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2401.16312v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] XAI-CF -- Examining the Role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Forensics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02452</link><description>arXiv:2402.02452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of complex cyber devices Cyber Forensics (CF) is facing many new challenges. For example, there are dozens of systems running on smartphones, each with more than millions of downloadable applications. Sifting through this large amount of data and making sense requires new techniques, such as from the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). To apply these techniques successfully in CF, we need to justify and explain the results to the stakeholders of CF, such as forensic analysts and members of the court, for them to make an informed decision. If we want to apply AI successfully in CF, there is a need to develop trust in AI systems. Some other factors in accepting the use of AI in CF are to make AI authentic, interpretable, understandable, and interactive. This way, AI systems will be more acceptable to the public and ensure alignment with legal standards. An explainable AI (XAI) system can play this role in CF, and we call such a system XAI-CF. XAI-CF is indispensable and is still in its infancy. In this paper, we explore and make a case for the significance and advantages of XAI-CF. We strongly emphasize the need to build a successful and practical XAI-CF system and discuss some of the main requirements and prerequisites of such a system. We present a formal definition of the terms CF and XAI-CF and a comprehensive literature review of previous works that apply and utilize XAI to build and increase trust in CF. We discuss some challenges facing XAI-CF. We also provide some concrete solutions to these challenges. We identify key insights and future research directions for building XAI applications for CF. This paper is an effort to explore and familiarize the readers with the role of XAI applications in CF, and we believe that our work provides a promising basis for future researchers interested in XAI-CF.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2402.02452v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TorchCP: A Python Library for Conformal Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12683</link><description>arXiv:2402.12683v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical framework that generates prediction intervals or sets with guaranteed coverage probability. While CP algorithms have evolved beyond traditional classifiers and regressors to sophisticated deep learning models like deep neural networks (DNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and large language models (LLMs), existing CP libraries often lack the model support and scalability for large-scale deep learning (DL) scenarios. This paper introduces TorchCP, a PyTorch-native library designed to integrate state-of-the-art CP algorithms into DL techniques, including DNN-based classifiers/regressors, GNNs, and LLMs. Released under the LGPL-3.0 license, TorchCP comprises about 16k lines of code, validated with 100\% unit test coverage and detailed documentation. Notably, TorchCP enables CP-specific training algorithms, online prediction, and GPU-accelerated batch processing, achieving up to 90\% reduction in inference time on large datasets. With its low-coupling design, comprehensive suite of advanced methods, and full GPU scalability, TorchCP empowers researchers and practitioners to enhance uncertainty quantification across cutting-edge applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2402.12683v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OMGEval: An Open Multilingual Generative Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13524</link><description>arXiv:2402.13524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) should generally benefit individuals from various cultural backgrounds around the world. However, most recent advanced generative evaluation benchmarks tailed for LLMs mainly focus on English. To this end, we introduce OMGEval, the first Open-source Multilingual Generative test set that can assess the capability of LLMs in different languages. For each language, OMGEval provides 804 open-ended questions, covering a wide range of important capabilities of LLMs, such as general knowledge, logical reasoning, and so on. Each question is rigorously verified by human annotators. Notably, to sufficiently reflect the compatibility of LLMs in different cultural backgrounds, we perform localization for each non-English language. Specifically, the current version of OMGEval includes 5 languages (i.e., Zh, Ru, Fr, Es, Ar). Following AlpacaEval, we employ GPT-4 as the adjudicator to automatically score different model outputs, which is shown closely related to human evaluation. We evaluate several representative multilingual LLMs on the proposed OMGEval, which we believe will provide a valuable reference for the community to further understand and improve the multilingual capability of LLMs. OMGEval is available at https://github.com/blcuicall/OMGEval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2402.13524v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can Distillation Mitigate Backdoor Attacks in Pre-trained Encoders?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03846</link><description>arXiv:2403.03846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a prominent paradigm for pre-training encoders to learning general-purpose representations from unlabeled data and releasing them on third-party platforms for broad downstream deep learning tasks. However, SSL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an adversary may train and distribute poisoned pre-training encoders to contaminate the downstream models. In this paper, we study a defense mechanism based on distillation against poisoned encoders in SSL. Traditionally, distillation transfers knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model to a student model, enabling the student to replicate or refine the teacher's learned representations. We repurpose distillation to extract benign knowledge and remove backdoors from a poisoned pre-trained encoder to produce a clean and reliable pre-trained model. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of distillation in mitigating backdoor attacks on pre-trained encoders. Based on two state-of-the-art backdoor attacks and four widely adopted image classification datasets, our results demonstrate that distillation reduces the attack success rate from 80.87% to 27.51%, with only a 6.35% drop in model accuracy. Furthermore, by comparing four teacher architectures, three student models, and six loss functions, we find that the distillation with fine-tuned teacher networks, warm-up-based student training, and attention-based distillation losses yield the best performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2403.03846v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlashFace: Human Image Personalization with High-fidelity Identity Preservation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17008</link><description>arXiv:2403.17008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents FlashFace, a practical tool with which users can easily personalize their own photos on the fly by providing one or a few reference face images and a text prompt. Our approach is distinguishable from existing human photo customization methods by higher-fidelity identity preservation and better instruction following, benefiting from two subtle designs. First, we encode the face identity into a series of feature maps instead of one image token as in prior arts, allowing the model to retain more details of the reference faces (e.g., scars, tattoos, and face shape ). Second, we introduce a disentangled integration strategy to balance the text and image guidance during the text-to-image generation process, alleviating the conflict between the reference faces and the text prompts (e.g., personalizing an adult into a "child" or an "elder"). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various applications, including human image personalization, face swapping under language prompts, making virtual characters into real people, etc. Project Page: https://jshilong.github.io/flashface-page.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2403.17008v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parameterized Algorithms for Coordinated Motion Planning: Minimizing Energy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15950</link><description>arXiv:2404.15950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of a generalization of the coordinated motion planning problem on graphs, where the goal is to route a specified subset of a given set of $k$ robots to their destinations with the aim of minimizing the total energy (i.e., the total length traveled). We develop novel techniques to push beyond previously-established results that were restricted to solid grids.
  We design a fixed-parameter additive approximation algorithm for this problem parameterized by $k$ alone. This result, which is of independent interest, allows us to prove the following two results pertaining to well-studied coordinated motion planning problems: (1) A fixed-parameter algorithm, parameterized by $k$, for routing a single robot to its destination while avoiding the other robots, which is related to the famous Rush-Hour Puzzle; and (2) a fixed-parameter algorithm, parameterized by $k$ plus the treewidth of the input graph, for the standard \textsc{Coordinated Motion Planning} (CMP) problem in which we need to route all the $k$ robots to their destinations. The latter of these results implies, among others, the fixed-parameter tractability of CMP parameterized by $k$ on graphs of bounded outerplanarity, which include bounded-height subgrids.
  We complement the above results with a lower bound which rules out the fixed-parameter tractability for CMP when parameterized by the total energy. This contrasts the recently-obtained tractability of the problem on solid grids under the same parameterization. As our final result, we strengthen the aforementioned fixed-parameter tractability to hold not only on solid grids but all graphs of bounded local treewidth -- a class including, among others, all graphs of bounded genus.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.15950v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Finding patterns of meaning: Reassessing Construal Clustering via Bipolar Class Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17042</link><description>arXiv:2404.17042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical research on \textit{construals}--social affinity groups that share similar patterns of meaning--has advanced significantly in recent years. This progress is largely driven by the development of \textit{Construal Clustering Methods} (CCMs), which group survey respondents into construal clusters based on similarities in their response patterns. We identify key limitations of existing CCMs, which affect their accuracy when applied to the typical structures of available data, and introduce Bipolar Class Analysis (BCA), a CCM designed to address these shortcomings. BCA measures similarity in response shifts between expressions of support and rejection across survey respondents, addressing conceptual and measurement challenges in existing methods. We formally define BCA and demonstrate its advantages through extensive simulation analyses, where it consistently outperforms existing CCMs in accurately identifying construals. Along the way, we develop a novel data-generation process that approximates more closely how individuals map latent opinions onto observable survey responses, as well as a new metric to evaluate the performance of CCMs. Additionally, we find that applying BCA to previously studied real-world datasets reveals substantively different construal patterns compared to those generated by existing CCMs in prior empirical analyses. Finally, we discuss limitations of BCA and outline directions for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.17042v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Posterior Label Smoothing for Node Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00410</link><description>arXiv:2406.00410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Label smoothing is a widely studied regularization technique in machine learning. However, its potential for node classification in graph-structured data, spanning homophilic to heterophilic graphs, remains largely unexplored. We introduce posterior label smoothing, a novel method for transductive node classification that derives soft labels from a posterior distribution conditioned on neighborhood labels. The likelihood and prior distributions are estimated from the global statistics of the graph structure, allowing our approach to adapt naturally to various graph properties. We evaluate our method on 10 benchmark datasets using eight baseline models, demonstrating consistent improvements in classification accuracy. The following analysis demonstrates that soft labels mitigate overfitting during training, leading to better generalization performance, and that pseudo-labeling effectively refines the global label statistics of the graph.

Abstract: With the developments in machine learning, there has been a surge in interest and results focused on algorithms utilizing predictions, not least in online algorithms where most new results incorporate the prediction aspect for concrete online problems. While the structural computational hardness of problems with regards to time and space is quite well developed, not much is known about online problems where time and space resources are typically not in focus. Some information-theoretical insights were gained when researchers considered online algorithms with oracle advice, but predictions of uncertain quality is a very different matter.
  We initiate the development of a complexity theory for online problems with predictions, focusing on binary predictions for minimization problems. Based on the most generic hard online problem type, string guessing, we define a family of hierarchies of complexity classes (indexed by pairs of error measures) and develop notions of reductions, class membership, hardness, and completeness. Our framework contains all the tools one expects to find when working with complexity, and we illustrate our tools by analyzing problems with different characteristics. In addition, we show that known lower bounds for paging with discard predictions apply directly to all hard problems for each class in the hierarchy based on the canonical pair of error measures. This paging problem is not complete for these classes.
  Our work also implies corresponding complexity classes for classic online problems without predictions, with the corresponding complete problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.18265v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Monocular pose estimation of articulated open surgery tools -- in the wild</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12138</link><description>arXiv:2407.12138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for monocular 6D pose estimation of surgical instruments in open surgery, addressing challenges such as object articulations, specularity, occlusions, and synthetic-to-real domain adaptation. The proposed approach consists of three main components: $(1)$ synthetic data generation pipeline that incorporates 3D scanning of surgical tools with articulation rigging and physically-based rendering; $(2)$ a tailored pose estimation framework combining tool detection with pose and articulation estimation; and $(3)$ a training strategy on synthetic and real unannotated video data, employing domain adaptation with automatically generated pseudo-labels. Evaluations conducted on real data of open surgery demonstrate the good performance and real-world applicability of the proposed framework, highlighting its potential for integration into medical augmented reality and robotic systems. The approach eliminates the need for extensive manual annotation of real surgical data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.12138v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Comparing and Contrasting DLWP Backbones on Navier-Stokes and Atmospheric Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14129</link><description>arXiv:2407.14129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large number of Deep Learning Weather Prediction (DLWP) architectures -- based on various backbones, including U-Net, Transformer, Graph Neural Network, and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) -- have demonstrated their potential at forecasting atmospheric states. However, due to differences in training protocols, forecast horizons, and data choices, it remains unclear which (if any) of these methods and architectures are most suitable for weather forecasting and for future model development. Here, we step back and provide a detailed empirical analysis, under controlled conditions, comparing and contrasting the most prominent DLWP models, along with their backbones. We accomplish this by predicting synthetic two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes and real-world global weather dynamics. On synthetic data, we observe favorable performance of FNO, while on the real-world WeatherBench dataset, our results demonstrate the suitability of ConvLSTM and SwinTransformer for short-to-mid-ranged forecasts. For long-ranged weather rollouts of up to 50 years, we observe superior stability and physical soundness in architectures that formulate a spherical data representation, i.e., GraphCast and Spherical FNO.

Abstract: For safety-critical applications, it is crucial to audit 3D human pose estimators before deployment. Will the system break down if the weather or the clothing changes? Is it robust regarding gender and age? To answer these questions and more, we need controlled studies with images that differ in a single attribute, but real benchmarks cannot provide such pairs. We thus present STAGE, a GenAI data toolkit for auditing 3D human pose estimators. For STAGE, we develop the first GenAI image creator with accurate 3D pose control and propose a novel evaluation strategy to isolate and quantify the effects of single factors such as gender, ethnicity, age, clothing, location, and weather. Enabled by STAGE, we generate a series of benchmarks to audit, for the first time, the sensitivity of popular pose estimators towards such factors. Our results show that natural variations can severely degrade pose estimator performance, raising doubts about their readiness for open-world deployment. We aim to highlight these robustness issues and establish STAGE as a benchmark to quantify them.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.16536v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FC-KAN: Function Combinations in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01763</link><description>arXiv:2409.01763v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce FC-KAN, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that leverages combinations of popular mathematical functions such as B-splines, wavelets, and radial basis functions on low-dimensional data through element-wise operations. We explore several methods for combining the outputs of these functions, including sum, element-wise product, the addition of sum and element-wise product, representations of quadratic and cubic functions, concatenation, linear transformation of the concatenated output, and others. In our experiments, we compare FC-KAN with a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and other existing KANs, such as BSRBF-KAN, EfficientKAN, FastKAN, and FasterKAN, on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Two variants of FC-KAN, which use a combination of outputs from B-splines and Difference of Gaussians (DoG) and from B-splines and linear transformations in the form of a quadratic function, outperformed overall other models on the average of 5 independent training runs. We expect that FC-KAN can leverage function combinations to design future KANs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems excel in delivering comprehensive suggestions by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, they often inherit biases from skewed training data, favoring mainstream content while underrepresenting diverse or non-traditional options. This study explores the interplay between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, focusing on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. This paper analyzes bias in LLM-based recommendation systems across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, and Gemini), revealing its deep and pervasive impact on outcomes. Intersecting identities and contextual factors, like socioeconomic status, further amplify biases, complicating fair recommendations across diverse groups. Our findings reveal that bias in these systems is deeply ingrained, yet even simple interventions like prompt engineering can significantly reduce it. We further propose a retrieval-augmented generation strategy to mitigate bias more effectively. Numerical experiments validate these strategies, demonstrating both the pervasive nature of bias and the impact of the proposed solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.10825v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Impacts of aspect ratio on task accuracy in parallel coordinates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12540</link><description>arXiv:2409.12540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parallel coordinates plots (PCPs) are a widely used visualization method, particularly for exploratory analysis. Previous studies show that PCPs perform much more poorly for estimating positive correlation than for estimating negative correlation, but it is not clear if this is affected by the aspect ratio (AR) of the axes pairs. In this paper, we present the results from an evaluation of the effect of the aspect ratio of axes in static (non-interactive) PCPs for two tasks: a) linear correlation estimation and b) value tracing. For both tasks we find strong evidence that AR influences accuracy, including ARs greater than 1:1 being much more performant for estimation of positive correlations. We provide a set of recommendations for visualization designers using PCPs for correlation or value-tracing tasks, based on the data characteristics and expected use cases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.12540v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARB-LLM: Alternating Refined Binarizations for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03129</link><description>arXiv:2410.03129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly pushed forward advancements in natural language processing, yet their high memory and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Binarization, as an effective compression technique, can shrink model weights to just 1 bit, significantly reducing the high demands on computation and memory. However, current binarization methods struggle to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, while also overlooking the column deviation in LLM weight distribution. To tackle these issues, we propose ARB-LLM, a novel 1-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) technique tailored for LLMs. To narrow the distribution shift between binarized and full-precision weights, we first design an alternating refined binarization (ARB) algorithm to progressively update the binarization parameters, which significantly reduces the quantization error. Moreover, considering the pivot role of calibration data and the column deviation in LLM weights, we further extend ARB to ARB-X and ARB-RC. In addition, we refine the weight partition strategy with column-group bitmap (CGB), which further enhance performance. Equipping ARB-X and ARB-RC with CGB, we obtain ARB-LLM$_\text{X}$ and ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ respectively, which significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) binarization methods for LLMs. As a binary PTQ method, our ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ is the first to surpass FP16 models of the same size.

Abstract: Recently, researchers have begun to experiment with deep learning-based methods for detecting major depressive disor-der (MDD) using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in search of a more objective means of diagnosis. However, exist-ing spatiotemporal feature extraction methods only consider the functional correlation between multiple electrodes and temporal correlation of EEG signals, ignoring the spatial posi-tion connection information between electrodes and the conti-nuity between time windows, which reduces the model's fea-ture extraction capabilities. To address this issue, a Spatio-temporal fused network for MDD detection with Electrode spatial Topology and adjacent TIME-window transition in-formation (SET-TIME) is proposed in this study. SET-TIME is composed by a common feature extractor, a secondary time-correlation feature extractor, and a domain adaptation (DA) module, in which the former extractor is used to obtain the temporal and spatial features, and the latter extractor can mine the correlation between multiple time windows, and the DA module is adopted to enhance cross-subject detection ca-pability. The experimental results of 10-fold cross-validation show that the proposed SET-TIME method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by achieving MDD detection accuracies of 92.00% and 94.00% on the public datasets PRED+CT and MODMA, respectively. Ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the multiple modules in SET-TIME, which assist in MDD detection by exploring the intrin-sic spatiotemporal information of EEG signals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.08521v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Strengthening False Information Propagation Detection: Leveraging SVM and Sophisticated Text Vectorization Techniques in comparison to BERT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12703</link><description>arXiv:2411.12703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation, particularly through online platforms, underscores the urgent need for reliable detection systems. This study explores the utilization of machine learning and natural language processing, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and BERT, to detect fake news. We employ three distinct text vectorization methods for SVM: Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, and Bag of Words (BoW), evaluating their effectiveness in distinguishing between genuine and fake news. Additionally, we compare these methods against the transformer large language model, BERT. Our comprehensive approach includes detailed preprocessing steps, rigorous model implementation, and thorough evaluation to determine the most effective techniques. The results demonstrate that while BERT achieves superior accuracy with 99.98% and an F1-score of 0.9998, the SVM model with a linear kernel and BoW vectorization also performs exceptionally well, achieving 99.81% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9980. These findings highlight that, despite BERT's superior performance, SVM models with BoW and TF-IDF vectorization methods come remarkably close, offering highly competitive performance with the advantage of lower computational requirements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.12703v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Numerical analysis of a constrained strain energy minimization problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19089</link><description>arXiv:2411.19089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a setting in which an evolving surface is implicitly characterized as the zero level of a level set function. Such an implicit surface does not encode any information about the path of a single point on the evolving surface. In the literature different approaches for determining a velocity that induces corresponding paths of points on the surface have been proposed. One of these is based on minimization of the strain energy functional. This then leads to a constrained minimization problem, which has a corresponding equivalent formulation as a saddle point problem. The main topic of this paper is a detailed analysis of this saddle point problem and of a finite element discretization of this problem. We derive well-posedness results for the continuous and discrete problems and optimal error estimates for a finite element discretization that uses standard $H^1$-conforming finite element spaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.19089v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] 2DMamba: Efficient State Space Model for Image Representation with Applications on Giga-Pixel Whole Slide Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00678</link><description>arXiv:2412.00678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently modeling large 2D contexts is essential for various fields including Giga-Pixel Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) and remote sensing. Transformer-based models offer high parallelism but face challenges due to their quadratic complexity for handling long sequences. Recently, Mamba introduced a selective State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity and high parallelism, enabling effective and efficient modeling of wide context in 1D sequences. However, extending Mamba to vision tasks, which inherently involve 2D structures, results in spatial discrepancies due to the limitations of 1D sequence processing. On the other hand, current 2D SSMs inherently model 2D structures but they suffer from prohibitively slow computation due to the lack of efficient parallel algorithms. In this work, we propose 2DMamba, a novel 2D selective SSM framework that incorporates the 2D spatial structure of images into Mamba, with a highly optimized hardware-aware operator, adopting both spatial continuity and computational efficiency. We validate the versatility of our approach on both WSIs and natural images. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets for WSI classification and survival analysis show that 2DMamba improves up to 2.48% in AUC, 3.11% in F1 score, 2.47% in accuracy and 5.52% in C-index. Additionally, integrating our method with VMamba for natural imaging yields 0.5 to 0.7 improvements in mIoU on the ADE20k semantic segmentation dataset, and 0.2% accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K classification dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal training have significantly improved the integration of image understanding and generation within a unified model. This study investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understanding tasks, focusing on how visual information is processed and transferred to the textual domain. We compare native multimodal VLMs, models trained from scratch on multimodal data to generate both text and images, and non-native multimodal VLMs, models adapted from pre-trained large language models or capable of generating only text, highlighting key differences in information flow. We find that in native multimodal VLMs, image and text embeddings are more separated within the residual stream. Moreover, VLMs differ in how visual information reaches text: non-native multimodal VLMs exhibit a distributed communication pattern, where information is exchanged through multiple image tokens, whereas models trained natively for joint image and text generation tend to rely on a single post-image token that acts as a narrow gate for visual information. We show that ablating this single token significantly deteriorates image-understanding performance, whereas targeted, token-level interventions reliably steer image semantics and downstream text with fine-grained control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.06646v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Library for Learning Neural Operators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10354</link><description>arXiv:2412.10354v5 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in recent years, primarily due to self-attention. However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the number of inference tokens increases. This work addresses these issues by proposing a new design principle for attention, viewing it as a two-stage process. The first stage (normalisation) refines standard attention by replacing Softmax with the more numerically stable Softplus followed by $l_{1}$-normalisation. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic scale factor based on invariance entropy. We show that this novel attention mechanism outperforms conventional Softmax attention, and state-of-the-art Softmax-free alternatives. Our second proposal is to introduce a second processing stage (sharpening) which consists of a re-weighting mechanism that amplifies significant attentional weights while diminishing weaker ones. This enables the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens, mitigating the attention sink phenomenon, and fundamentally improving length extrapolation. This novel, two-stage, replacement for self-attention is shown to ensure numerical stability and dramatically improve length extrapolation, maintaining a nearly constant validation loss at 16$\times$ the training length while achieving superior results on challenging long-context retrieval tasks and downstream benchmarks. Furthermore, symbolic regression experiments demonstrate that our method enables models to recover Newton's gravitational law from orbital trajectory sequences, providing evidence that appropriate attention mechanisms are crucial for foundation models to develop genuine physical world models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.13428v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Transformer Optimization via Gradient Heterogeneity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00213</link><description>arXiv:2502.00213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers are difficult to optimize with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and largely rely on adaptive optimizers such as Adam. Despite their empirical success, the reasons behind Adam's superior performance over SGD remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyze the optimization of Transformer models through the lens of \emph{gradient heterogeneity}, defined as the variation in gradient norms across parameter blocks. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that gradient heterogeneity, together with Hessian heterogeneity, degrades the convergence of gradient-based methods such as SGD, while sign-based methods are substantially less sensitive to this effect. Adam's coordinate-wise normalization makes its update directions depend mainly on gradient signs, so Adam can be interpreted as a soft variant of SignSGD. Our analysis uses the fact that SGD and SignSGD follow steepest descent directions under different norms, and derives upper bounds on the iteration complexity with implications for learning rate scaling in SignSGD. We further investigate the origin of gradient heterogeneity in Transformer architectures and show that it is strongly influenced by the placement of layer normalization, with Post-LN architectures exhibiting particularly pronounced heterogeneity. Experimental results from fine-tuning Transformers in both NLP and vision domains validate our theoretical analysis.

Abstract: DiT models have achieved great success in text-to-video generation, leveraging their scalability in model capacity and data scale. High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high-resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands-especially for single-stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low-resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage achieves a nearly straight ODE trajectory between low and high resolutions via flow matching, effectively generating fine details and fixing artifacts with minimal NFEs. To ensure a seamless connection between the two independently trained stages during inference, we carefully design degradation strategies during the second-stage training. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high-resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency. Additionally, the two-stage design enables users to preview the initial output and accordingly adjust the prompt before committing to full-resolution generation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and wait times as well as enhancing commercial viability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.05179v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Imitation Learning under Expert-Observable and Expert-Unobservable Confounding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07656</link><description>arXiv:2502.07656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for causal Imitation Learning (IL) with hidden confounders, which subsumes several existing settings. Our framework accounts for two types of hidden confounders: (a) variables observed by the expert but not by the imitator, and (b) confounding noise hidden from both. By leveraging trajectory histories as instruments, we reformulate causal IL in our framework into a Conditional Moment Restriction (CMR) problem. We propose DML-IL, an algorithm that solves this CMR problem via instrumental variable regression, and upper bound its imitation gap. Empirical evaluation on continuous state-action environments, including Mujoco tasks, demonstrates that DML-IL outperforms existing causal IL baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.07656v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ambig-SWE: Interactive Agents to Overcome Underspecificity in Software Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13069</link><description>arXiv:2502.13069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly being deployed to automate tasks, often based on underspecified user instructions. Making unwarranted assumptions to compensate for the missing information and failing to ask clarifying questions can lead to suboptimal outcomes, safety risks due to tool misuse, and wasted computational resources. In this work, we study the ability of LLM agents to handle underspecified instructions in interactive code generation settings by evaluating proprietary and open-weight models on their performance across three key steps: (a) detecting underspecificity, (b) asking targeted clarification questions, and (c) leveraging the interaction to improve performance in underspecified scenarios. We introduce Ambig-SWE, an underspecified variant of SWE-Bench Verified, specifically designed to evaluate agent behavior under ambiguity and interaction. Our findings reveal that models struggle to distinguish between well-specified and underspecified instructions. However, when models interact for underspecified inputs, they effectively obtain vital information from the user leading to significant improvements in performance, up to 74% over the non-interactive settings, underscoring the value of effective interaction. Our study highlights critical gaps in how current state-of-the-art models handle missing information in complex software engineering tasks and structures the evaluation into distinct steps to enable targeted improvements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.13069v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PSDNorm: Test-Time Temporal Normalization for Deep Learning in Sleep Staging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04582</link><description>arXiv:2503.04582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distribution shift poses a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly in biomedical applications using data collected across different subjects, institutions, and recording devices, such as sleep data. While existing normalization layers, BatchNorm, LayerNorm and InstanceNorm, help mitigate distribution shifts, when applied over the time dimension they ignore the dependencies and auto-correlation inherent to the vector coefficients they normalize. In this paper, we propose PSDNorm that leverages Monge mapping and temporal context to normalize feature maps in deep learning models for signals. Evaluations with architectures based on U-Net or transformer backbones trained on 10K subjects across 10 datasets, show that PSDNorm achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen left-out datasets while being more robust to data scarcity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.04582v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPEED: Scalable, Precise, and Efficient Concept Erasure for Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07392</link><description>arXiv:2503.07392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erasing concepts from large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has become increasingly crucial due to the growing concerns over copyright infringement, offensive content, and privacy violations. In scalable applications, fine-tuning-based methods are time-consuming to precisely erase multiple target concepts, while real-time editing-based methods often degrade the generation quality of non-target concepts due to conflicting optimization objectives. To address this dilemma, we introduce SPEED, an efficient concept erasure approach that directly edits model parameters. SPEED searches for a null space, a model editing space where parameter updates do not affect non-target concepts, to achieve scalable and precise erasure. To facilitate accurate null space optimization, we incorporate three complementary strategies: Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF) to selectively retain the most affected non-target concepts, Directed Prior Augmentation (DPA) to enrich the filtered retain set with semantically consistent variations, and Invariant Equality Constraints (IEC) to preserve key invariants during the T2I generation process. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks demonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in non-target preservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure, successfully erasing 100 concepts within only 5 seconds.

Abstract: Existing video large language models (VLLMs) primarily leverage prompt agnostic visual encoders, which extract untargeted facial representations without awareness of the queried information, leading to the loss of task critical cues. To address this challenge, we propose FaVChat, the first VLLM designed for reasoning over subtle visual and dynamic facial cues. FaVChat introduces a hierarchical, prompt guided visual feature extraction framework that emphasizes question relevant information at three complementary levels. These multi level features are dynamically fused and injected into the LLM, enabling more accurate facial details reasoning To further improve learning efficiency under data scarcity, we propose Data Efficient GRPO, a reinforcement learning strategy that iteratively identifies high utility samples and maximizes the contribution of each instance via per instance utility estimation, substantially enhancing performance gains under limited supervision. We construct a large scale benchmark dataset FaVChat 170K, comprising approximately 60K high quality facial videos and 170K question answer pairs focusing on fine grained facial details. Extensive experiments, including zero shot evaluations on four facial understanding tasks, demonstrate that FaVChat consistently outperforms existing VLLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.09158v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CASteer: Cross-Attention Steering for Controllable Concept Erasure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09630</link><description>arXiv:2503.09630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed image generation, yet controlling their outputs to reliably erase undesired concepts remains challenging. Existing approaches usually require task-specific training and struggle to generalize across both concrete (e.g., objects) and abstract (e.g., styles) concepts. We propose CASteer (Cross-Attention Steering), a training-free framework for concept erasure in diffusion models using steering vectors to influence hidden representations dynamically. CASteer precomputes concept-specific steering vectors by averaging neural activations from images generated for each target concept. During inference, it dynamically applies these vectors to suppress undesired concepts only when they appear, ensuring that unrelated regions remain unaffected. This selective activation enables precise, context-aware erasure without degrading overall image quality. This approach achieves effective removal of harmful or unwanted content across a wide range of visual concepts, all without model retraining. CASteer outperforms state-of-the-art concept erasure techniques while preserving unrelated content and minimizing unintended effects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.09630v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ethical AI for Young Digital Citizens: A Call to Action on Privacy Governance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11947</link><description>arXiv:2503.11947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital platforms used by youth has created significant challenges related to privacy, autonomy, and data protection. While AI-driven personalization offers enhanced user experiences, it often operates without clear ethical boundaries, leaving young users vulnerable to data exploitation and algorithmic biases. This paper presents a call to action for ethical AI governance, advocating for a structured framework that ensures youth-centred privacy protections, transparent data practices, and regulatory oversight. We outline key areas requiring urgent intervention, including algorithmic transparency, privacy education, parental data-sharing ethics, and accountability measures. Through this approach, we seek to empower youth with greater control over their digital identities and propose actionable strategies for policymakers, AI developers, and educators to build a fairer and more accountable AI ecosystem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.11947v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FactSelfCheck: Fact-Level Black-Box Hallucination Detection for LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17229</link><description>arXiv:2503.17229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content, posing significant challenges for applications where factuality is crucial. While existing hallucination detection methods typically operate at the sentence level or passage level, we propose FactSelfCheck, a novel zero-resource black-box sampling-based method that enables fine-grained fact-level detection. Our approach represents text as interpretable knowledge graphs consisting of facts in the form of triples, providing clearer insights into content factuality than traditional approaches. Through analyzing factual consistency across multiple LLM responses, we compute fine-grained hallucination scores without requiring external resources or training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that FactSelfCheck performs competitively with leading sentence-level sampling-based methods while providing more detailed and interpretable insights. Most notably, our fact-level approach significantly improves hallucination correction, achieving a 35.5% increase in factual content compared to the baseline, while sentence-level SelfCheckGPT yields only a 10.6% improvement. The granular nature of our detection enables more precise identification and correction of hallucinated content. Additionally, we contribute FavaMultiSamples, a novel dataset that addresses a gap in the field by providing the research community with a second dataset for evaluating sampling-based methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.17229v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AccidentSim: Generating Vehicle Collision Videos with Physically Realistic Collision Trajectories from Real-World Accident Reports</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20654</link><description>arXiv:2503.20654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collecting real-world vehicle accident videos for autonomous driving research is challenging due to their rarity and complexity. While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.20654v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Integrating Fourier Neural Operators with Diffusion Models to improve Spectral Representation of Synthetic Earthquake Ground Motion Response</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00757</link><description>arXiv:2504.00757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear reactor buildings must be designed to withstand the dynamic load induced by strong ground motion earthquakes. For this reason, their structural behavior must be assessed in multiple realistic ground shaking scenarios (e.g., the Maximum Credible Earthquake). However, earthquake catalogs and recorded seismograms may not always be available in the region of interest. Therefore, synthetic earthquake ground motion is progressively being employed, although with some due precautions: earthquake physics is sometimes not well enough understood to be accurately reproduced with numerical tools, and the underlying epistemic uncertainties lead to prohibitive computational costs related to model calibration. In this study, we propose an AI physics-based approach to generate synthetic ground motion, based on the combination of a neural operator that approximates the elastodynamics Green's operator in arbitrary source-geology setups, enhanced by a denoising diffusion probabilistic model. The diffusion model is trained to correct the ground motion time series generated by the neural operator. Our results show that such an approach promisingly enhances the realism of the generated synthetic seismograms, with frequency biases and Goodness-Of-Fit (GOF) scores being improved by the diffusion model. This indicates that the latter is capable to mitigate the mid-frequency spectral falloff observed in the time series generated by the neural operator. Our method showcases fast and cheap inference in different site and source conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.00757v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Split Federated Learning for Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: Joint Sensing, Communication, Computation, and Control Co-design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01443</link><description>arXiv:2504.01443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with integrated sensing, communication, computation and control (ISC3) capabilities have become key enablers of next-generation wireless networks. Federated edge learning (FEL) leverages UAVs as mobile learning agents to collect data, perform local model updates, and contribute to global model aggregation. However, existing UAV-assisted FEL systems face critical challenges, including excessive computational demands, privacy risks, and inefficient communication, primarily due to the requirement for full-model training on resource-constrained UAVs. To deal with aforementioned challenges, we propose Split Federated Learning for UAV-Enabled ISC3 (SFLSC3), a novel framework that integrates split federated learning (SFL) into UAV-assisted FEL. SFLSC3 optimally partitions model training between UAVs and edge servers, significantly reducing UAVs' computational burden while preserving data privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis of UAV deployment, split point selection, data sensing volume, and client-side aggregation frequency, deriving closed-form upper bounds for the convergence gap. Based on these insights, we conceive a joint optimization problem to minimize the delay required to achieve a target model accuracy. Given the non-convex nature of the problem, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to efficiently determine UAV deployment, split point selection, and communication frequency. Extensive simulations on a target motion recognition task validate the effectiveness of SFLSC3, demonstrating superior convergence and delay performance compared to baseline methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.01443v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CaLiV: LiDAR-to-Vehicle Calibration of Arbitrary Sensor Setups</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01987</link><description>arXiv:2504.01987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous systems, sensor calibration is essential for safe and efficient navigation in dynamic environments. Accurate calibration is a prerequisite for reliable perception and planning tasks such as object detection and obstacle avoidance. Many existing LiDAR calibration methods require overlapping fields of view, while others use external sensing devices or postulate a feature-rich environment. In addition, Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration is not supported by the vast majority of calibration algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel target-based technique for extrinsic Sensor-to-Sensor and Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration of multi-LiDAR systems called CaLiV. This algorithm works for non-overlapping fields of view and does not require any external sensing devices. First, we apply motion to produce field of view overlaps and utilize a simple Unscented Kalman Filter to obtain vehicle poses. Then, we use the Gaussian mixture model-based registration framework GMMCalib to align the point clouds in a common calibration frame. Finally, we reduce the task of recovering the sensor extrinsics to a minimization problem. We show that both translational and rotational Sensor-to-Sensor errors can be solved accurately by our method. In addition, all Sensor-to-Vehicle rotation angles can also be calibrated with high accuracy. We validate the simulation results in real-world experiments.

Abstract: Much of federated learning (FL) focuses on settings where local dataset statistics remain the same between training and testing. However, this assumption often does not hold in practice due to distribution shifts, motivating the development of domain generalization (DG) approaches that leverage source domain data to train models capable of generalizing to unseen target domains. In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in existing work on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG objectives; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to the star-topology architecture. We develop Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style Sharing ($\textit{StyleDDG}$), a decentralized DG algorithm which allows devices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style information inferred from their datasets. Additionally, we provide the first systematic approach to analyzing style-based DG training in decentralized networks. We cast existing centralized DG algorithms within our framework, and employ their formalisms to model $\textit{StyleDDG}$. We then obtain analytical conditions under which convergence of $\textit{StyleDDG}$ can be guaranteed. Through experiments on popular DG datasets, we demonstrate that $\textit{StyleDDG}$ can obtain significant improvements in accuracy across target domains with minimal communication overhead compared to baseline decentralized gradient methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.06235v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepGreen: Effective LLM-Driven Greenwashing Monitoring System Designed for Empirical Testing -- Evidence from China</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07733</link><description>arXiv:2504.07733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the emerging adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in economics and management research, this paper investigates whether LLMs can reliably identify corporate greenwashing narratives and, more importantly, whether and how the greenwashing signals extracted from textual disclosures can be used to empirically identify causal effects. To this end, this paper proposes DeepGreen, a dual-stage LLM-Driven system for detecting potential corporate greenwashing in annual reports. Applied to 9369 A-share annual reports published between 2021 and 2023, DeepGreen attains high reliability in random-sample validation at both stages. Ablation experiment shows that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) reduces hallucinations, as compared to simply lengthening the input window. Empirical tests indicate that "greenwashing" captured by DeepGreen can effectively reveal a positive relationship between greenwashing and environmental penalties, and IV, PSM, Placebo test, which enhance the robustness and causal effects of the empirical evidence. Further study suggests that the presence and number of green investors can weaken the positive correlation between greenwashing and penalties. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the positive relationship between "greenwashing - penalty" is less significant in large-sized corporations and corporations that have accumulated green assets, indicating that these green assets may be exploited as a credibility shield for greenwashing. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can standardize ESG oversight by early warning and direct regulators' scarce attention toward the subsets of corporations where monitoring is more warranted.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.07733v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Location-Oriented Sound Event Localization and Detection with Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08365</link><description>arXiv:2504.08365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) combines the Sound Event Detection (SED) with the corresponding Direction Of Arrival (DOA). Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.08365v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Detecting Instruction Fine-tuning Attacks using Influence Function</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09026</link><description>arXiv:2504.09026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning attacks pose a serious threat to large language models (LLMs) by subtly embedding poisoned examples in fine-tuning datasets, leading to harmful or unintended behaviors in downstream applications. Detecting such attacks is challenging because poisoned data is often indistinguishable from clean data, and prior knowledge of triggers or attack strategies is rarely available. We present a detection method that requires no prior knowledge of the attack. Our approach leverages influence functions under semantic transformation by comparing influence distributions before and after semantic inversions to identify critical poisons, defined as examples whose influence is strong and remains unchanged across transformations. We introduce a multi-transform ensemble approach that achieves F1 scores between 79.5 and 95.2 percent with precision between 66 and 100 percent on sentiment classification, significantly improving over single-transform methods. Our method generalizes to unseen transformation types with an F1 score of 86 percent through cross-category validation. We demonstrate effectiveness across multiple models, including T5-small and DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B, and across tasks such as sentiment classification and math reasoning. Removing a small fraction of detected poisons, between 1 and 3 percent of the data, restores model performance to near-clean levels. These results demonstrate the practicality of influence-based diagnostics for defending against instruction fine-tuning attacks in real-world large language model deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can answer prompts in many languages, despite being trained predominantly on English; yet, the mechanisms driving this generalization remain poorly understood. This work asks: How does an LLM's ability to align representations of non-English inputs to English impact its performance on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks? We study the role of representation alignment in instance-level task decisions, complementing prior analyses conducted both at the language level and task-independently. We introduce the Discriminative Alignment Index ($\DALI$) to quantify instance-level alignment across 24 languages other than English and three distinct NLU tasks. Results show that incorrect NLU predictions are strongly associated with lower representation alignment with English in the model's middle layers. Through activation patching, we show that incorrect predictions in languages other than English can be fixed by patching their parallel English activations in the middle layers, thereby demonstrating the causal role of representation (mis)alignment in cross-lingual correctness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.09378v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Matters in Linearizing Language Models?

Abstract: Linearization has emerged as a strategy for developing efficient language models (LMs). Starting from an existing Transformer-based LM, linearization replaces the attention component with computationally efficient subquadratic \textit{token mixers}. However, as an increasing number of mixers are proposed, it remains unclear which inductive biases are best suited to inherit the original Transformer's capabilities. Furthermore, it is unknown how linearization is affected by parameter and token budget scaling. To address these questions, we propose a unified setup to compare seven representative architectures, including xLSTM, GLA, and Gated DeltaNet. Our findings reveal that performance hierarchies remain stable from 140M to 1.7B parameters, with error-correcting update rules demonstrating superior scaling exponents. We show that performance gaps are established early and persist through asymptotic maturity at 10B tokens, suggesting that state resolution is a more fundamental bottleneck than the distillation budget. Finally, while most models adapt to instruction tuning, only gated delta-rule formulations maintain the precision necessary for long-context retrieval, whereas additive models suffer from irreversible state saturation. These results suggest that for successful linearization, architectural inductive biases remain the primary constraint that cannot be overcome by simply scaling training compute.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.14366v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analysis and Elimination of Numerical Pressure Dependency in Coupled Stokes-Darcy Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19116</link><description>arXiv:2504.19116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyses the classical mixed finite element method (FEM) and a pressure-robust variant with divergence-free reconstruction operators for the coupled Stokes-Darcy problem. Its main contribution is to provide viscosity-explicit a priori error estimates that clearly distinguish the pressure dependence of the two discretizations: the velocity error of the classical scheme depends on both the exact pressure and the viscosity, whereas the pressure-robust method eliminates both entirely. Moreover, we derive pressure error estimates and quantify their dependence on the exact solution and model parameters.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models mark a transformative advancement in artificial intelligence, aiming to unify perception, natural language understanding, and embodied action within a single computational framework. This foundational review presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action models, systematically organized across five thematic pillars that structure the landscape of this rapidly evolving field. We begin by establishing the conceptual foundations of VLA systems, tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners, and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations, efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations. We explore diverse application domains such as autonomous vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, humanoid robotics, and augmented reality. We analyzed challenges and propose solutions including agentic adaptation and cross-embodiment planning. Furthermore, we outline a forward-looking roadmap where VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to strengthen socially aligned, adaptive, and general-purpose embodied agents. This work, is expected to serve as a foundational reference for advancing intelligent, real-world robotics and artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: The advantage function is a central concept in RL that helps reduce variance in policy gradient estimates. Recently, for language modeling, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was proposed to compute the advantage for each output by subtracting the mean reward, as the baseline, for all outputs in the group. However, it can lead to high variance when the reward advantage is inaccurately estimated. In this work, we propose Kalman Filter Enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization (KRPO) model, by using lightweight Kalman filtering to dynamically estimate the latent reward baseline and uncertainty. This filtering technique replaces the naive group mean, enabling more adaptive advantage normalization. Our method does not require additional learned parameters over GRPO. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to incorporate group-level uncertainty for advantage estimation, improving policy optimization in settings where highly dynamic reward signals are difficult to model for language models. Through the accuracies and rewards obtained from math question answering and reasoning, we show that using a more adaptive advantage estimation model, KRPO can improve the performance and show more stable return curves upon GRPO. The code is available at https://github.com/billhhh/KRPO_LLMs_RL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.07527v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lost in Transmission: When and Why LLMs Fail to Reason Globally</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08140</link><description>arXiv:2505.08140v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.08140v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SuperCoder: Assembly Program Superoptimization with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11480</link><description>arXiv:2505.11480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superoptimization is the task of transforming a program into a faster one while preserving its input-output behavior. In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as superoptimizers, generating assembly programs that outperform code already optimized by industry-standard compilers. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for this problem, consisting of 8,072 assembly programs averaging 130 lines, in contrast to prior datasets restricted to 2-15 straight-line, loop-free programs. We evaluate 23 LLMs on this benchmark and find that the strongest baseline, Claude-opus-4, achieves a 51.5% test-passing rate and a 1.43x average speedup over gcc -O3. To further enhance performance, we fine-tune models with reinforcement learning, optimizing a reward function that integrates correctness and performance speedup. Starting from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (61.4% correctness, 1.10x speedup), the fine-tuned model SuperCoder attains 95.0% correctness and 1.46x average speedup, with additional improvement enabled by Best-of-N sampling and iterative refinement. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that LLMs can be applied as superoptimizers for assembly programs, establishing a foundation for future research in program performance optimization beyond compiler heuristics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.11480v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Street View to Visibility Network: Mapping Urban Visual Relationships with Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11809</link><description>arXiv:2505.11809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visibility analysis is one of the fundamental analytics methods in urban planning and landscape research, traditionally conducted through computational simulations based on the Line-of-Sight (LoS) principle. However, when assessing the visibility of named urban objects such as landmarks, geometric intersection alone fails to capture the contextual and perceptual dimensions of visibility as experienced in the real world. The study challenges the traditional LoS-based approaches by introducing a new, image-based visibility analysis method. Specifically, a Vision Language Model (VLM) is applied to detect the target object within a direction-zoomed Street View Image (SVI). Successful detection represents the object's visibility at the corresponding SVI location. Further, a heterogeneous visibility graph is constructed to address the complex interaction between observers and target objects. In the first case study, the method proves its reliability in detecting the visibility of six tall landmark constructions in global cities, with an overall accuracy of 87%. Furthermore, it reveals broader contextual differences when the landmarks are perceived and experienced. In the second case, the proposed visibility graph uncovers the form and strength of connections for multiple landmarks along the River Thames in London, as well as the places where these connections occur. Notably, bridges on the River Thames account for approximately 30% of total connections. Our method complements and enhances traditional LoS-based visibility analysis, and showcases the possibility of revealing the prevalent connection of any visual objects in the urban environment. It opens up new research perspectives for urban planning, heritage conservation, and computational social science.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.11809v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAINT: Attention-Based Policies for Discrete Combinatorial Action Spaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12109</link><description>arXiv:2505.12109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combinatorial structure of many real-world action spaces leads to exponential growth in the number of possible actions, limiting the effectiveness of conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Recent approaches for combinatorial action spaces impose factorized or sequential structures over sub-actions, failing to capture complex joint behavior. We introduce the Sub-Action Interaction Network using Transformers (SAINT), a novel policy architecture that represents multi-component actions as unordered sets and models their dependencies via self-attention conditioned on the global state. SAINT is permutation-invariant, sample-efficient, and compatible with standard policy optimization algorithms. In 18 distinct combinatorial environments across three task domains, including environments with $1.35 \times 10^{18}$ possible actions, SAINT consistently outperforms strong baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.12109v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LightRetriever: A LLM-based Text Retrieval Architecture with Extremely Faster Query Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12260</link><description>arXiv:2505.12260v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text retrieval retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full LLM on an A800 GPU, our method achieves over 1000x speedup in query encoding and over 10x increase in end-to-end retrieval throughput. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks show that LightRetriever generalizes well across diverse tasks, maintaining an average of 95% retrieval performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.12260v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language Models That Walk the Talk: A Framework for Formal Fairness Certificates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12767</link><description>arXiv:2505.12767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models become integral to high-stakes applications, ensuring their robustness and fairness is critical. Despite their success, large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations, such as synonym substitutions, can alter model predictions, posing risks in fairness-critical areas, such as gender bias mitigation, and safety-critical areas, such as toxicity detection. While formal verification has been explored for neural networks, its application to large language models remains limited. This work presents a holistic verification framework to certify the robustness of transformer-based language models, with a focus on ensuring gender fairness and consistent outputs across different gender-related terms. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to toxicity detection, offering formal guarantees that adversarially manipulated toxic inputs are consistently detected and appropriately censored, thereby ensuring the reliability of moderation systems. By formalizing robustness within the embedding space, this work strengthens the reliability of language models in ethical AI deployment and content moderation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.12767v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CacheFlow: Fast Human Motion Prediction by Cached Normalizing Flow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13140</link><description>arXiv:2505.13140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many density estimation techniques for 3D human motion prediction require a significant amount of inference time, often exceeding the duration of the predicted time horizon. To address the need for faster density estimation for 3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human motion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative models that suffer from poor time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an unconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture into the density of future motions. The results of the computation of the flow-based generative model can be precomputed and cached. Then, for conditional prediction, we seek a mapping from historical trajectories to samples in the Gaussian mixture. This mapping can be done by a much more lightweight model, thus saving significant computation overhead compared to a typical conditional flow model. In such a two-stage fashion and by caching results from the slow flow model computation, we build our CacheFlow without loss of prediction accuracy and model expressiveness. This inference process is completed in approximately one millisecond, making it 4 times faster than previous VAE methods and 30 times faster than previous diffusion-based methods on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M and AMASS datasets. Furthermore, our method demonstrates improved density estimation accuracy and comparable prediction accuracy to a SOTA method on Human3.6M. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/meaten/CacheFlow.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.13140v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Policy-Driven World Model Adaptation for Robust Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13709</link><description>arXiv:2505.13709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for data-driven control. Compared to model-free approaches, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns a world model from a static dataset and uses it as a surrogate simulator, improving data efficiency and enabling potential generalization beyond the dataset support. However, most existing offline MBRL methods follow a two-stage training procedure: first learning a world model by maximizing the likelihood of the observed transitions, then optimizing a policy to maximize its expected return under the learned model. This objective mismatch results in a world model that is not necessarily optimized for effective policy learning. Moreover, we observe that policies learned via offline MBRL often lack robustness during deployment, and small adversarial noise in the environment can lead to significant performance degradation. To address these, we propose a framework that dynamically adapts the world model alongside the policy under a unified learning objective aimed at improving robustness. At the core of our method is a maximin optimization problem, which we solve by innovatively utilizing Stackelberg learning dynamics. We provide theoretical analysis to support our design and introduce computationally efficient implementations. We benchmark our algorithm on twelve noisy D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three stochastic Tokamak Control tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.13709v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Warm Up Before You Train: Unlocking General Reasoning in Resource-Constrained Settings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13718</link><description>arXiv:2505.13718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing effective reasoning-capable LLMs typically requires training using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) or distillation with carefully curated Long Chain of Thoughts (CoT), both of which depend heavily on extensive training data. This creates a major challenge when the amount of quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the first stage, we "warm up" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain, namely, Knights \&amp; Knaves (K\&amp;amp;K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this two-phase approach offers several benefits: $(i)$ the warmup phase alone facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval$^{+}$, and MMLU-Pro; $(ii)$ When both the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small dataset ($\leq100$ examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the base model; $(iii)$ Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; $(iv)$ Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall sample efficiency during RLVR training. The results in this paper highlight the promise of warmup for building robust reasoning LLMs in data-scarce environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.13718v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mechanistic evaluation of Transformers and state space models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15105</link><description>arXiv:2505.15105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State space models (SSMs) for language modelling promise an efficient and performant alternative to quadratic-attention Transformers, yet show variable performance on recalling basic information from the context. While performance on synthetic tasks like Associative Recall (AR) can point to this deficiency, behavioural metrics provide little information as to \textit{why} -- on a mechanistic level -- certain architectures fail and others succeed. To address this, we conduct experiments on AR, and find that only Transformers and Based SSM models fully succeed at AR, with Mamba and DeltaNet close behind, while the other SSMs (H3, Hyena) fail. We then use causal interventions to explain why. We find that Transformers and Based learn to store key-value associations in-context using induction. By contrast, the SSMs seem to compute these associations only at the last state using a single layer. We further investigate the mechanism underlying the success of Mamba, and find novel evidence that Mamba \textit{does} implement induction: not via the SSM, but instead via short convolutions. Further experiments on a new hierarchical retrieval task, Associative Treecall (ATR), show that all architectures learn the same mechanism as they did for AR. Furthermore, we show that Mamba can learn Attention-like induction on ATR when short convolutions are removed. These results reveal that architectures with similar accuracy may still have substantive differences, motivating the adoption of mechanistic evaluations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.15105v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diverse, not Short: A Length-Controlled Data Selection Strategy for Improving Response Diversity of Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16245</link><description>arXiv:2505.16245v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diverse language model responses are crucial for creative generation, open-ended tasks, and self-improvement training. We show that common diversity metrics, and even reward models used for preference optimization, systematically bias models toward shorter outputs, limiting expressiveness. To address this, we introduce Diverse, not Short (Diverse-NS), a length-controlled data selection strategy that improves response diversity while maintaining length parity. By generating and filtering preference data that balances diversity, quality, and length, Diverse-NS enables effective training using only 3,000 preference pairs. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B and the Olmo-2 family, Diverse-NS substantially enhances lexical and semantic diversity. We show consistent improvement in diversity with minor reduction or gains in response quality on four creative generation tasks: Divergent Associations, Persona Generation, Alternate Uses, and Creative Writing. Surprisingly, experiments with the Olmo-2 model family (7B, and 13B) show that smaller models like Olmo-2-7B can serve as effective "diversity teachers" for larger models. By explicitly addressing length bias, our method efficiently pushes models toward more diverse and expressive outputs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.16245v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Analysis of Concept Bottleneck Models: Measuring, Understanding, and Mitigating the Impact of Noisy Annotations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16705</link><description>arXiv:2505.16705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) ensure interpretability by decomposing predictions into human interpretable concepts. Yet the annotations used for training CBMs that enable this transparency are often noisy, and the impact of such corruption is not well understood. In this study, we present the first systematic study of noise in CBMs and show that even moderate corruption simultaneously impairs prediction performance, interpretability, and the intervention effectiveness. Our analysis identifies a susceptible subset of concepts whose accuracy declines far more than the average gap between noisy and clean supervision and whose corruption accounts for most performance loss. To mitigate this vulnerability we propose a two-stage framework. During training, sharpness-aware minimization stabilizes the learning of noise-sensitive concepts. During inference, where clean labels are unavailable, we rank concepts by predictive entropy and correct only the most uncertain ones, using uncertainty as a proxy for susceptibility. Theoretical analysis and extensive ablations elucidate why sharpness-aware training confers robustness and why uncertainty reliably identifies susceptible concepts, providing a principled basis that preserves both interpretability and resilience in the presence of noise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.16705v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NeUQI: Near-Optimal Uniform Quantization Parameter Initialization for Low-Bit LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17595</link><description>arXiv:2505.17595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across domains but face significant challenges when deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or personal devices such as laptops, due to high memory consumption and inference costs. Post-training quantization (PTQ) of LLMs offers a promising solution that reduces their memory footprint and decoding latency. In practice, PTQ with uniform quantization representation is favored due to its efficiency and ease of deployment, as uniform quantization is widely supported by mainstream hardware and software libraries. Recent studies on low-bit uniform quantization have led to noticeable improvements in post-quantization model performance; however, they mainly focus on quantization methodologies, while the initialization of quantization parameters remains underexplored and still relies on the conventional Min-Max formula. In this work, we identify the limitations of the Min-Max formula, move beyond its constraints, and propose NeUQI, a method that efficiently determines near-optimal initialization for uniform quantization. Our NeUQI simplifies the joint optimization of the scale and zero-point by deriving the zero-point for a given scale, thereby reducing the problem to a scale-only optimization. Benefiting from the improved quantization parameters, our NeUQI consistently outperforms existing methods in the experiments with the LLaMA and Qwen families on various settings and tasks. Furthermore, when combined with a lightweight distillation strategy, NeUQI even achieves superior performance to PV-tuning, a considerably more resource-intensive method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.17595v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking the Sampling Criteria in Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning: A Competence-Difficulty Alignment Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17652</link><description>arXiv:2505.17652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning exhibits potential in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet it is hard to scale for the low sample efficiency during the rollout phase. Existing methods attempt to improve efficiency by scheduling problems based on problem difficulties. However, these approaches suffer from unstable and biased estimations of problem difficulty and fail to capture the alignment between model competence and problem difficulty in RL training, leading to suboptimal results. To tackle these limitations, this paper introduces $\textbf{C}$ompetence-$\textbf{D}$ifficulty $\textbf{A}$lignment $\textbf{S}$ampling ($\textbf{CDAS}$), which enables accurate and stable estimation of problem difficulties by aggregating historical performance discrepancies of problems. Then the model competence is quantified to adaptively select problems whose difficulty is in alignment with the model's current competence using a fixed-point system. Experimental results across a range of challenging mathematical benchmarks show that CDAS achieves great improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. CDAS attains the highest average accuracy against baselines and exhibits significant speed advantages compared to Dynamic Sampling, a competitive strategy in DAPO, which is 2.33 times slower than CDAS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.17652v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Just as Humans Need Vaccines, So Do Models: Model Immunization to Combat Falsehoods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17870</link><description>arXiv:2505.17870v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Ballbot (i.e. Ball balancing robot) navigation usually relies on methods rooted in control theory (CT), and works that apply Reinforcement learning (RL) to the problem remain rare while generally being limited to specific subtasks (e.g. balance recovery). Unlike CT based methods, RL does not require (simplifying) assumptions about environment dynamics (e.g. the absence of slippage between the ball and the floor). In addition to this increased accuracy in modeling, RL agents can easily be conditioned on additional observations such as depth-maps without the need for explicit formulations from first principles, leading to increased adaptivity. Despite those advantages, there has been little to no investigation into the capabilities, data-efficiency and limitations of RL based methods for ballbot control and navigation. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of an open-source, RL-friendly simulator for this task. In this paper, we present an open-source ballbot simulation based on MuJoCo, and show that with appropriate conditioning on exteroceptive observations as well as reward shaping, policies learned by classical model-free RL methods are capable of effectively navigating through randomly generated uneven terrain, using a reasonable amount of data (four to five hours on a system operating at 500hz).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, with Reinforcement Learning (RL) playing a key role in adapting them to specific applications. In mathematical problem solving, however, the reliance on ground truth answers poses significant challenges due to their high collection cost and limited availability.
  This work explores the use of simple surrogate signals, format and length, to guide RL training. We find that early training is dominated by format learning, where structural feedback alone accounts for most performance gains. Incorporating length-based rewards further refines outputs by discouraging overly long or short responses, enabling a GRPO approach with format-length signals to approximate, and in some cases surpass, ground-truth-based optimization. For example, our method achieves 40.0% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model, and generalizes across different model sizes and series.
  Beyond practical efficiency, these findings provide an inspirational perspective on RL: rather than imparting new knowledge, RL primarily activates reasoning capabilities already embedded in pre-trained models. This insight suggests that lightweight, label-efficient strategies can complement pre-training to unlock LLMs' latent potential in reasoning-intensive tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.19439v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Model Agnostic Differentially Private Causal Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19589</link><description>arXiv:2505.19589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is essential in fields such as medicine, economics and social sciences, where privacy concerns are paramount. We propose a general, model-agnostic framework for differentially private estimation of average treatment effects (ATE) that avoids strong structural assumptions on the data-generating process or the models used to estimate propensity scores and conditional outcomes. In contrast to prior work, which enforces differential privacy by directly privatizing these nuisance components, our approach decouples nuisance estimation from privacy protection. This separation allows the use of flexible, state-of-the-art black-box models, while differential privacy is achieved by perturbing only predictions and aggregation steps within a fold-splitting scheme with ensemble techniques. We instantiate the framework for three classical estimators -- the G-Formula, inverse propensity weighting (IPW), and augmented IPW (AIPW) -- and provide formal utility and privacy guarantees, together with privatized confidence intervals. Empirical results on synthetic and real data show that our methods maintain competitive performance under realistic privacy budgets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.19589v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spatially-Adaptive Gradient Re-parameterization for 3D Large Kernel Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19603</link><description>arXiv:2505.19603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large kernel convolutions offer a scalable alternative to vision transformers for high-resolution 3D volumetric analysis, yet naively increasing kernel size often leads to optimization instability. Motivated by the spatial bias inherent in effective receptive fields (ERFs), we theoretically demonstrate that structurally re-parameterized blocks induce spatially varying learning rates that are crucial for convergence. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Rep3D, a framework that employs a lightweight modulation network to generate receptive-biased scaling masks, adaptively re-weighting kernel updates within a plain encoder architecture. This approach unifies spatial inductive bias with optimization-aware learning, avoiding the complexity of multi-branch designs while ensuring robust local-to-global convergence. Extensive evaluations on five 3D segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that Rep3D consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and fixed-prior baselines.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding. However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2) introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a 10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4\% of the original performance.

Abstract: Current 3DGS compression methods largely forego the neural analysis-synthesis transform, which is a crucial component in learned signal compression systems. As a result, redundancy removal is left solely to the entropy coder, overburdening the entropy coding module and reducing rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To fix this critical omission, we propose a training-time transform coding (TTC) method that adds the analysis-synthesis transform and optimizes it jointly with the 3DGS representation and entropy model. Concretely, we adopt a hierarchical design: a channel-wise KLT for decorrelation and energy compaction, followed by a sparsity-aware neural transform that reconstructs the KLT residuals with minimal parameter and computational overhead. Experiments show that our method delivers strong R-D performance with fast decoding, offering a favorable BD-rate-decoding-time trade-off over SOTA 3DGS compressors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.22908v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Studying the Soupability of Documents in State Space Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24033</link><description>arXiv:2505.24033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether hidden states from Structured State Space Models (SSMs) can be merged post hoc to support downstream reasoning. Inspired by model souping, we study document souping, a strategy where documents are encoded independently, and their representations are pooled, via simple operations like averaging, into a single context state. This approach enables modular encoding and reuse without reprocessing the full input for each query. We demonstrate that finetuned Mamba2 models with souped representations achieve competitive or superior performance across multi-hop QA, sparse retrieval, and long-document reasoning tasks compared to the standard monolithic encoding approach. For example, on the RACE and QuALITY benchmarks for long document question answering, this method substantially outperforms a traditional concatenation approach. Crucially, this modular design scales to hundreds of documents while delivering substantial savings in inference cost, unlocking new possibilities for large-scale corpus reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.24033v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Framing Political Bias in Multilingual LLMs Across Pakistani Languages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00068</link><description>arXiv:2506.00068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape public discourse, yet most evaluations of political and economic bias have focused on high-resource, Western languages and contexts. This leaves critical blind spots in low-resource, multilingual regions such as Pakistan, where linguistic identity is closely tied to political, religious, and regional ideologies. We present a systematic evaluation of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five Pakistani languages: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto, and Balochi. Our framework integrates a culturally adapted Political Compass Test (PCT) with multi-level framing analysis, capturing both ideological stance (economic/social axes) and stylistic framing (content, tone, emphasis). Prompts are aligned with 11 socio-political themes specific to the Pakistani context. Results show that while LLMs predominantly reflect liberal-left orientations consistent with Western training data, they exhibit more authoritarian framing in regional languages, highlighting language-conditioned ideological modulation. We also identify consistent model-specific bias patterns across languages. These findings show the need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing frameworks in global NLP.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.00068v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unlearning's Blind Spots: Over-Unlearning and Prototypical Relearning Attack</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01318</link><description>arXiv:2506.01318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to expunge a designated forget set from a trained model without costly retraining, yet the existing techniques overlook two critical blind spots: "over-unlearning" that deteriorates retained data near the forget set, and post-hoc "relearning" attacks that aim to resurrect the forgotten knowledge. Focusing on class-level unlearning, we first derive an over-unlearning metric, OU@epsilon, which quantifies collateral damage in regions proximal to the forget set, where over-unlearning mainly appears. Next, we expose an unforeseen relearning threat on MU, i.e., the Prototypical Relearning Attack, which exploits the per-class prototype of the forget class with just a few samples, and easily restores the pre-unlearning performance. To counter both blind spots in class-level unlearning, we introduce Spotter, a plug-and-play objective that combines (i) a masked knowledge-distillation penalty on the nearby region of forget classes to suppress OU@epsilon, and (ii) an intra-class dispersion loss that scatters forget-class embeddings, neutralizing Prototypical Relearning Attacks. Spotter achieves state-of-the-art results across CIFAR, TinyImageNet, and CASIA-WebFace datasets, offering a practical remedy to unlearning's blind spots.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.01318v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Navigation Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02883</link><description>arXiv:2506.02883v2 Announce Type: replace

We define a set of various tasks and datasets, evaluation protocols, and metrics to assess the performance of algorithms, including state-of-the-art baselines. Our benchmark is designed not only to foster reproducible research and to accelerate progress in continual reinforcement learning for gaming, but also to provide a reproducible framework for production pipelines -- helping practitioners to identify and to apply effective approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.02883v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PPO in the Fisher-Rao geometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03757</link><description>arXiv:2506.03757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely used in reinforcement learning due to its strong empirical performance, yet it lacks formal guarantees for policy improvement and convergence. PPO's clipped surrogate objective is motivated by a lower bound on linearization of the value function in flat geometry setting. We derive a tighter surrogate objective and introduce Fisher-Rao PPO (FR-PPO) by leveraging the Fisher-Rao (FR) geometry. Our scheme provides strong theoretical guarantees, including monotonic policy improvement. In the direct parametrization setting, we show that FR-PPO achieves sub-linear convergence with no dependence on action or state space dimensions, and for parametrized policies we further obtain sub-linear convergence up to the compatible function approximation error. Finally, although our primary focus is theoretical, we also demonstrate empirically that FR-PPO performs well across a range of standard reinforcement learning tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.03757v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-Shot Open-Schema Entity Structure Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04458</link><description>arXiv:2506.04458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results. To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing. Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to extract more complete entity structures across three different domains, showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity structure discovery in various scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04458v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are LLMs Stable Formal Logic Translators in Logical Reasoning Across Linguistically Diversified Texts?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575</link><description>arXiv:2506.04575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has received growing attention. One mainstream approach translates natural language into formal logic and then applies symbolic solvers for deduction. While effective in many tasks, these LLM-based translators often fail to generate consistent symbolic representations when the same concept appears in different linguistic forms. Such inconsistencies break logical coherence and lead to solver errors. However, most existing benchmarks lack this type of linguistic variation, which frequently occurs in real-world text, leaving the problem underexplored. To address this gap, we present SoLT, a benchmark that systematically rewrites reasoning datasets into diverse yet logically equivalent forms across multiple levels. Beyond evaluation, SoLT also provides a general method to enrich any dataset with linguistic diversity while preserving both meaning and logic. To further enhance the stability of LLM-based reasoning, we propose MenTaL, which explicitly guides models to build a concept-symbol mapping table during translation. By linking equivalent expressions to shared symbols, MenTaL maintains consistency and mitigates symbol drift. Experiments on SoLT demonstrate that LLMs indeed suffer from inconsistent symbol mapping under linguistic variation, leading to significant drops in reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, applying MenTaL brings clear and stable performance improvements across diverse inputs. Overall, our findings reveal that overlooking linguistic diversity hides key weaknesses in LLM-based translators, and our work offers a step toward more reliable logical reasoning in varied real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However, existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions, exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures. Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04694v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quasiparticle Interference Kernel Extraction with Variational Autoencoders via Latent Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05325</link><description>arXiv:2506.05325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem, because many different kernels can combine to produce almost the same observed image, and noise or overlaps further obscure the true signal. Existing solutions to this extraction problem rely on manually zooming into small local regions with isolated single-scatterers. This is infeasible for real cases where scattering conditions are too complex. In this work, we propose the first AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction, which models the space of physically valid kernels and uses this knowledge to guide the inverse mapping. We introduce a two-step learning strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the model to infer kernels robustly under complex, entangled scattering conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher extraction accuracy, improved generalization to unseen kernels. To further validate its effectiveness, we also apply the method to real QPI data from Ag and FeSe samples, where it reliably extracts meaningful kernels under complex scattering conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.05325v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ravan: Multi-Head Low-Rank Adaptation for Federated Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05568</link><description>arXiv:2506.05568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have not yet effectively leveraged the vast amounts of edge-device data, and federated learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without transferring private edge data to the cloud. To operate within the computation and communication constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across clients. We propose Ravan, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads $s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices $\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads, recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$ directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that Ravan improves test accuracy by $2-8\%$ over prior parameter-efficient baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.05568v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Antithetic Noise in Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06185</link><description>arXiv:2506.06185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically study antithetic initial noise in diffusion models, discovering that pairing each noise sample with its negation consistently produces strong negative correlation. This universal phenomenon holds across datasets, model architectures, conditional and unconditional sampling, and even other generative models such as VAEs and Normalizing Flows. To explain it, we combine experiments and theory and propose a \textit{symmetry conjecture} that the learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up to a constant shift), supported by empirical evidence. This negative correlation leads to substantially more reliable uncertainty quantification with up to $90\%$ narrower confidence intervals. We demonstrate these gains on tasks including estimating pixel-wise statistics and evaluating diffusion inverse solvers. We also provide extensions with randomized quasi-Monte Carlo noise designs for uncertainty quantification, and explore additional applications of the antithetic noise design to improve image editing and generation diversity. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic, and adds no runtime overhead.

Abstract: Providers of LLM-as-a-service have predominantly adopted a simple pricing model: users pay a fixed price per token. Consequently, one may think that the price two different users would pay for the same output string under the same input prompt is the same. In our work, we show that, surprisingly, this is not (always) true. We find empirical evidence that, particularly for non-english outputs, both proprietary and open-weights LLMs often generate the same (output) string with multiple different tokenizations, even under the same input prompt, and this in turn leads to arbitrary price variation. To address the problem of tokenization multiplicity, we introduce canonical generation, a type of constrained generation that restricts LLMs to only generate canonical tokenizations -- the unique tokenization in which each string is tokenized during the training process of an LLM. Further, we introduce an efficient sampling algorithm for canonical generation based on the Gumbel-Max trick. Experiments on a variety of natural language tasks demonstrate that our sampling algorithm for canonical generation is comparable to standard sampling in terms of performance and runtime, and it solves the problem of tokenization multiplicity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.06446v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Video Unlearning via Low-Rank Refusal Vector</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07891</link><description>arXiv:2506.07891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video generative models achieve high-quality synthesis from natural-language prompts by leveraging large-scale web data. However, this training paradigm inherently exposes them to unsafe biases and harmful concepts, introducing the risk of generating undesirable or illicit content. To mitigate unsafe generations, existing machine unlearning approaches either rely on filtering, and can therefore be bypassed, or they update model weights, but with costly fine-tuning or training-free closed-form edits. We propose the first training-free weight update framework for concept removal in video diffusion models. From five paired safe/unsafe prompts, our method estimates a refusal vector and integrates it into the model weights as a closed-form update. A contrastive low-rank factorization further disentangles the target concept from unrelated semantics, it ensures a selective concept suppression and it does not harm generation quality. Our approach reduces unsafe generations on the Open-Sora and ZeroScopeT2V models across the T2VSafetyBench and SafeSora benchmarks, with average reductions of 36.3% and 58.2% respectively, while preserving prompt alignment and video quality. This establishes an efficient and scalable solution for safe video generation without retraining nor any inference overhead.

Abstract: Diffusion models, typically formulated as discretizations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative tasks. However, their theoretical analysis often involves complex proofs. In this work, we present a simplified framework for analyzing the Euler--Maruyama discretization of variance-preserving SDEs (VP-SDEs). Using Gr\"onwall's inequality, we derive a convergence rate of $O(T^{-1/2})$ under standard Lipschitz assumptions, streamlining prior analyses. We then demonstrate that the standard Gaussian noise can be replaced by computationally cheaper discrete random variables (e.g., Rademacher) without sacrificing this convergence guarantee, provided the mean and variance are matched. Our experiments validate this theory, showing that (i) discrete noise achieves sample quality comparable to Gaussian noise provided the variance is matched correctly, and (ii) performance degrades if the noise variance is scaled incorrectly.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.08337v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Symmetrical Flow Matching: Unified Image Generation, Segmentation, and Classification with Score-Based Generative Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10634</link><description>arXiv:2506.10634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective, SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps. Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10634v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BNMusic: Blending Environmental Noises into Personalized Music</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10754</link><description>arXiv:2506.10754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However, misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work, we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in morally sensitive domains, it is crucial to understand how persona traits affect their moral reasoning and persuasive behavior. We present the first large-scale study of multi-dimensional persona effects in AI-AI debates over real-world moral dilemmas. Using a 6-dimensional persona space (age, gender, country, class, ideology, and personality), we simulate structured debates between AI agents over 131 relationship-based cases. Our results show that personas affect initial moral stances and debate outcomes, with political ideology and personality traits exerting the strongest influence. Persuasive success varies across traits, with liberal and open personalities reaching higher consensus and win rates. While logit-based confidence grows during debates, emotional and credibility-based appeals diminish, indicating more tempered argumentation over time. These trends mirror findings from psychology and cultural studies, reinforcing the need for persona-aware evaluation frameworks for AI moral reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.12657v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Direct Reasoning Optimization: Constrained RL with Token-Level Dense Reward and Rubric-Gated Constraints for Open-ended Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13351</link><description>arXiv:2506.13351v2 Announce Type: replace

R3 measures the model's token-level certainty of a reference answer under its CoT reasoning prefix while selectively emphasizing reasoning-reflective tokens to capture how likely the generated reasoning is to yield the desired answer. Rubric-gating complements R3 by operationalizing principled task criteria as hard accept/reject checks on final answers. Empirically, across four datasets, our framework outperforms baselines, achieves faster, more sample-efficient learning, and respects feasibility constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.13351v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A hybrid isogeometric and finite element method: NURBS-enhanced finite element method for hexahedral meshes (NEFEM-HEX)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13694</link><description>arXiv:2506.13694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a NURBS-enhanced finite element method that integrates the NURBS-based boundary representation of a geometric domain into a standard finite element framework for hexahedral meshes. We decompose an open, bounded, convex three-dimensional domain with a NURBS boundary into two parts, define NURBS-enhanced finite elements over the boundary layer, and use piecewise-linear Lagrange finite elements in the interior region. We introduce a special quadrature rule and a stable interpolation operator for the NURBS-enhanced elements. We discuss how the h-refinement in finite element analysis and the knot insertion in isogeometric analysis can be utilized in the refinement of the NURBS-enhanced elements. To illustrate an application of our methodology, we utilize a generic weak formulation of a second-order linear elliptic boundary value problem and derive a priori error estimates in the $H^{1}$ norm. In addition, we use the Poisson problem as a model problem and provide numerical results that support the theoretical results. The proposed methodology combines the efficiency of finite element analysis with the geometric precision of NURBS, and may enable more accurate and efficient simulations over complex geometries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.13694v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stretching Beyond the Obvious: A Gradient-Free Framework to Unveil the Hidden Landscape of Visual Invariance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17040</link><description>arXiv:2506.17040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncovering which feature combinations are encoded by visual units is critical to understanding how images are transformed into representations that support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is critical to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS), a model-agnostic, gradient-free framework to systematically characterize a unit's maximally invariant stimuli, and its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations, in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter (stretch) the representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while preserving unit activation downstream (squeeze). To probe adversarial sensitivity, stretching and squeezing are reversed to maximally perturb unit activation while minimizing changes to the upstream representation. Applied to CNNs, SnS revealed invariant transformations that were farther from a reference image in pixel-space than those produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed depending on the stage of the image representation used for optimization: pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching mid- and late-layer representations mainly altered texture and pose. By measuring how well the hierarchical invariant images obtained for L2 robust networks were classified by humans and other observer networks, we discovered a substantial drop in their interpretability when the representation was stretched in deep layers, while the opposite trend was found for standard models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.17040v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Projective Quasimetric Planning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18847</link><description>arXiv:2506.18847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.18847v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The lightning method for the heat equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22576</link><description>arXiv:2506.22576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new method for solving the planar heat equation based on the Lightning Method. The lightning method is a recent development in the numerical solution of linear PDEs which expresses solutions using sums of polynomials and rational functions, or more generally as sums of fundamental solutions. The method is particularly well suited to handle domains with sharp corners where solution singularities are present. Boundary conditions are formed on a set of collocation points which is then solved as an overdetermined linear system. The approach of the present work is to utilize the Laplace transform to obtain a modified Helmholtz equation which is solved by an application of the lightning method. The numerical inversion of the Laplace transform is then performed by means of Talbot integration. Our validation of the method against existing results and multiple challenging test problems shows the method attains spectral accuracy with root-exponential convergence while being robust across a wide range of time intervals and adaptable to a variety of geometric scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.22576v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the rank weight hierarchy of $M$-codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00609</link><description>arXiv:2507.00609v3 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present Sparse Autoencoder For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/xzy-101/SAFER-code. \textit{This paper discusses topics related to reward model safety and may include discussions or examples that highlight potential risks or unsafe outcomes.}</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.00665v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiffusionLight-Turbo: Accelerated Light Probes for Free via Single-Pass Chrome Ball Inpainting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01305</link><description>arXiv:2507.01305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model, Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple, the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format. Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes, an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios.

Abstract: Program analysis and automated testing have recently become an essential part of SSDLC. Directed greybox fuzzing is one of the most popular automated testing methods that focuses on error detection in predefined code regions. However, it still lacks ability to overcome difficult program constraints. This problem can be well addressed by symbolic execution, but at the cost of lower performance. Thus, combining directed fuzzing and symbolic execution techniques can lead to more efficient error detection.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to directed fuzzing with novel seed scheduling algorithm, based on target-related interestingness and coverage. The approach also performs minimization and sorting of objective seeds according to a target-related information. We implement our approach in Sydr-Fuzz tool using LibAFL-DiFuzz as directed fuzzer and Sydr as dynamic symbolic executor. We evaluate our approach with Time to Exposure metric and compare it with pure LibAFL-DiFuzz, AFLGo, BEACON, WAFLGo, WindRanger, FishFuzz, and Prospector. The results show an improvement for 3 out of 7 examples with speedup up to 1.86 times over the second best result, as well as a significant improvement for 3 out of 7 examples over the pure LibAFL-DiFuzz fuzzer. Sydr-Fuzz hybrid approach to directed fuzzing shows high performance and helps to improve directed fuzzing efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.04855v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spattack: Subgroup Poisoning Attacks on Federated Recommender Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06258</link><description>arXiv:2507.06258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated recommender systems (FedRec) have emerged as a promising approach to provide personalized recommendations while protecting user privacy. However, recent studies have shown their vulnerability to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients inject crafted gradients to promote target items to benign users. Existing attacks typically target the full user group, which compromises stealth and increases detection risk. In contrast, real-world adversaries may prefer to target specific user subgroups, such as promoting health supplements to older individuals, to maximize effectiveness while preserving stealth. Motivated by this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first poisoning attack designed to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in federated settings. Spattack adopts an approximate-and-promote paradigm, which approximates user embeddings of target and non-target subgroups and then promotes target items to the target subgroup. We further reveal a trade-off between strong attack performance on the target subgroup and limited impact on the non-target subgroup. To achieve a better trade-off, we propose enhanced approximation and promotion strategies. For approximation, we push embeddings of different subgroups apart via contrastive learning and augment the target subgroup's relevant item set through clustering. For promotion, we align embeddings of target items and relevant items to strengthen their semantic connections, together with an adaptive weighting strategy to balance effects across subgroups. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Spattack achieves strong attack performance on the target subgroup with minimal impact on non-target users, even when only 0.1% of users are malicious. Moreover, Spattack maintains competitive recommendation performance and shows strong resilience against mainstream defenses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.06258v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Online Navigation Refinement: Achieving Lane-Level Guidance by Associating Standard-Definition and Online Perception Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07487</link><description>arXiv:2507.07487v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lane-level navigation is critical for geographic information systems and navigation-based tasks, offering finer-grained guidance than road-level navigation by standard definition (SD) maps. However, it currently relies on expansive global HD maps that cannot adapt to dynamic road conditions. Recently, online perception (OP) maps have become research hotspots, providing real-time geometry as an alternative, but lack the global topology needed for navigation. To address these issues, Online Navigation Refinement (ONR), a new mission is introduced that refines SD-map-based road-level routes into accurate lane-level navigation by associating SD maps with OP maps. The map-to-map association to handle many-to-one lane-to-road mappings under two key challenges: (1) no public dataset provides lane-to-road correspondences; (2) severe misalignment from spatial fluctuations, semantic disparities, and OP map noise invalidates traditional map matching. For these challenges, We contribute: (1) Online map association dataset (OMA), the first ONR benchmark with 30K scenarios and 2.6M annotated lane vectors; (2) MAT, a transformer with path-aware attention to aligns topology despite spatial fluctuations and semantic disparities and spatial attention for integrates noisy OP features via global context; and (3) NR P-R, a metric evaluating geometric and semantic alignment. Experiments show that MAT outperforms existing methods at 34 ms latency, enabling low-cost and up-to-date lane-level navigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.07487v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FloorplanQA: A Benchmark for Spatial Reasoning in LLMs using Structured Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07644</link><description>arXiv:2507.07644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce FloorplanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). FloorplanQA is grounded in structured representations of indoor scenes, such as (e.g., kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, and others), encoded symbolically in JSON or XML layouts. The benchmark covers core spatial tasks, including distance measurement, visibility, path finding, and object placement within constrained spaces. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial LLMs reveal that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to respect physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, though they remain mostly robust to small spatial perturbations. FloorplanQA uncovers a blind spot in today's LLMs: inconsistent reasoning about indoor layouts. We hope this benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.07644v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BlindSight: Harnessing Sparsity for Efficient Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09071</link><description>arXiv:2507.09071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable joint processing of text and images. However, incorporating vision data significantly increases the prompt length, resulting in a longer time to first token (TTFT). This bottleneck can be alleviated by leveraging the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. Analyzing these attention patterns in VLMs when processing a series of images, we observe the absence of inter-image attention in a substantial portion of layers. Based on this, we propose BlindSight: an approach to optimize multi-image VLM inference using an input-template-aware attention sparsity mask with no runtime overhead. We utilize a dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic categorization for attention heads: Dense, Sink, Intra-Image, and Intra-Image+Sink. We develop a Triton-based GPU kernel to leverage this sparsity. BlindSight achieves a 1.8-3.2x speedup in the attention computation (prompt length 36K-300K). BlindSight generalizes across VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, Gemma 3), with only a 0.78% absolute accuracy degradation on average on multi-image comprehension benchmarks. Finally, we advocate for the design of efficient VLMs that combine BlindSight-inspired sparse and dense layers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.09071v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Pre-training Framework for Relational Data with Information-theoretic Principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09837</link><description>arXiv:2507.09837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relational databases underpin critical infrastructure across a wide range of domains, yet the design of generalizable pre-training strategies for learning from relational databases remains an open challenge due to task heterogeneity. Specifically, there exist many possible downstream tasks, as tasks are defined based on relational schema graphs, temporal dependencies, and SQL-defined label logics. An effective pre-training framework is desired to take these factors into account in order to obtain task-aware representations. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying distribution that drives label generation, downstream tasks can benefit from relevant side-channel information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task Vector Estimation (TVE), a novel pre-training framework that constructs predictive supervisory signals via set-based aggregation over schema traversal graphs, explicitly modeling next-window relational dynamics. We formalize our approach through an information-theoretic lens, demonstrating that task-informed representations retain more relevant signals than those obtained without task priors. Extensive experiments on the RelBench benchmark show that TVE consistently outperforms traditional pre-training baselines. Our findings advocate for pre-training objectives that encode task heterogeneity and temporal structure as design principles for predictive modeling on relational databases.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for learning vision-based robotic policies for contact-rich manipulation tasks that generalize spatially across task configurations. We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF) and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT, G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance, localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH, screwing, and surface wiping tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and principles.

Abstract: Logistics operators, from battlefield coordinators re-routing airlifts ahead of a storm to warehouse managers juggling late trucks, need to make mission-critical decisions. Prevailing methods for logistics planning such as integer programming yield plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, assuming an idealized mathematical model of the environment. On the other hand, foundation models lower the intermediate processing barrier by translating natural-language user utterances into executable plans, yet they remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety and cost. We introduce a Vision-Language Logistics (VLL) agent, built on a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on user-objective interpretation. The agent interprets user requests and converts them into structured planning specifications, quantifies the uncertainty of the interpretation, and invokes an interactive clarification loop when the uncertainty exceeds an adaptive threshold. Drawing on a lightweight airlift logistics planning use case as an illustrative case study, we highlight a practical path toward certifiable and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics. Our lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 training samples, surpasses the zero-shot performance of 20x larger models in logistic planning tasks while cutting inference latency by nearly 50%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.11352v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MetaLint: Generalizable Idiomatic Code Quality Analysis through Instruction-Following and Easy-to-Hard Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11687</link><description>arXiv:2507.11687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models excel at code generation but struggle with code quality analysis, where best practices evolve and cannot be fully captured by static training data. We introduce MetaLint, a training framework that treats code quality analysis as detecting best practice violations from high-level specifications over semantic code fragments (code idioms). Instead of training on a fixed set of rules, MetaLint reorganizes supervision around dynamically specified best practices using synthetic linter-derived labels, integrated with instruction-following and preference optimization. This encourages extrapolation to more complex, unseen best practices at test time, consistent with easy-to-hard generalization without retraining. To evaluate MetaLint, we create a new benchmark of hard-to-detect best practices inspired by Python Enhancement Proposals. Across this benchmark, MetaLint improves generalization to unseen best practices. Qwen3-4B achieves a 2.7x detection F-score gain (25.9% -&gt; 70.4%), the highest recall, and a 26.7% localization F-score, matching larger models such as o3-mini. These gains generalize across programming languages, model families, scales, reasoning settings, and linter sources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.11687v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PICACO: Pluralistic In-Context Value Alignment of LLMs via Total Correlation Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16679</link><description>arXiv:2507.16679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment (ICA). However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs. tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses, theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise, resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs, outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance across up to 8 distinct values.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.16679v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Zero-overhead Flow for Security Closure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17385</link><description>arXiv:2507.17385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the traditional Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design flow, the concept of timing closure implies to reach convergence during physical synthesis such that, under a given area and power budget, the design works at the targeted frequency. However, security has been largely neglected when evaluating the Quality of Results (QoR) from physical synthesis. In general, commercial place &amp; route tools do not understand security goals. In this work, we propose a modified ASIC design flow that is security-aware and, differently from prior research, does not degrade QoR for the sake of security improvement. Therefore, we propose a first-of-its-kind zero-overhead flow for security closure. Our flow is concerned with two distinct threat models: (i) insertion of Hardware Trojans (HTs) and (ii) physical probing/fault injection. Importantly, the flow is entirely executed within a commercial place &amp; route engine and is scalable. In several metrics, our security-aware flow achieves the best-known results for the ISPD`22 set of benchmark circuits while incurring negligible design overheads due to security-related strategies. Finally, we open source the entire methodology (as a set of scripts) and also share the protected circuits (as design databases) for the benefit of the hardware security community.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.17385v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Debating Truth: Debate-driven Claim Verification with Multiple Large Language Model Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19090</link><description>arXiv:2507.19090v3 Announce Type: replace

Yet, zero-shot Moderators are biased toward neutral judgments, and no datasets exist for training them. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Debate-SFT}, a post-training framework that leverages synthetic data to enhance agents' ability to effectively adjudicate debates for claim verification.

Abstract: Blockchain technology is widely used in various fields due to its ability to provide decentralization and trustless security. This is a fundamental understanding held by many advocates, but it is misunderstood, leading participants to fail to recognize the limitations of the security that blockchain can provide. Among all current network attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks pose significant threats due to their ease of execution and destructive potential. This paper, based on the blockchain architecture hierarchy, categorizes and organizes existing DoS attacks, with a focus on explaining the principles and methods of contract layer and consensus layer DoS attacks. Furthermore, this paper comprehensively analyzes and compares commonly used detection methods and defense technologies, which will contribute to strengthening the security and stability of blockchain systems and promoting further innovation and application of blockchain systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.22611v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ElectriQ: A Benchmark for Assessing the Response Capability of Large Language Models in Power Marketing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22911</link><description>arXiv:2507.22911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As power systems decarbonise and digitalise, high penetrations of distributed energy resources and flexible tariffs make electric power marketing (EPM) a key interface between regulation, system operation and sustainable-energy deployment. Many utilities still rely on human agents and rule- or intent-based chatbots with fragmented knowledge bases that struggle with long, cross-scenario dialogues and fall short of requirements for compliant, verifiable and DR-ready interactions. Meanwhile, frontier large language models (LLMs) show strong conversational ability but are evaluated on generic benchmarks that underweight sector-specific terminology, regulatory reasoning and multi-turn process stability. To address this gap, we present ElectriQ, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework for LLMs in EPM. ElectriQ contains over 550k dialogues across six service domains and 24 sub-scenarios and defines a unified protocol that combines human ratings, automatic metrics and two compliance stress tests-Statutory Citation Correctness and Long-Dialogue Consistency. Building on ElectriQ, we propose SEEK-RAG, a retrieval-augmented method that injects policy and domain knowledge during finetuning and inference. Experiments on 13 LLMs show that domain-aligned 7B models with SEEK-RAG match or surpass much larger models while reducing computational cost, providing an auditable, regulation-aware basis for deploying LLM-based EPM assistants that support demand-side management, renewable integration and resilient grid operation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.22911v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Thinking Machines: Mathematical Reasoning in the Age of LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00459</link><description>arXiv:2508.00459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in structured reasoning and symbolic tasks, with coding emerging as a particularly successful application. This progress has naturally motivated efforts to extend these models to mathematics, both in its traditional form, expressed through natural-style mathematical language, and in its formalized counterpart, expressed in a symbolic syntax suitable for automatic verification. Yet, despite apparent parallels between programming and proof construction, advances in formalized mathematics have proven significantly more challenging. This gap raises fundamental questions about the nature of reasoning in current LLM architectures, the role of supervision and feedback, and the extent to which such models maintain an internal notion of computational or deductive state. In this article, we review the current state-of-the-art in mathematical reasoning with LLMs, focusing on recent models and benchmarks. We explore three central issues at the intersection of machine learning and mathematical cognition: (i) the trade-offs between traditional and formalized mathematics as training and evaluation domains; (ii) the structural and methodological reasons why proof synthesis remains more brittle than code generation; and (iii) whether LLMs genuinely represent or merely emulate a notion of evolving logical state. Our goal is not to draw rigid distinctions but to clarify the present boundaries of these systems and outline promising directions for their extension.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.00459v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Foundation Models for Mitotic Figure Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04441</link><description>arXiv:2508.04441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited. Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models, that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing, reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still yields competitive performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.04441v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Matrix-Driven Identification and Reconstruction of LLM Weight Homology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06309</link><description>arXiv:2508.06309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Matrix-Driven Identification and Reconstruction (MDIR), a SOTA large language model homology method that accurately detects weight correspondences between models and provides rigorous $p$-value estimation of the statistical significance of these correspondences. Our method does not require model inference, and allows the detection of unattributed reuse or replication of model weights even on low-resource devices as it compares only a single pair of matrices at a time. We leverage matrix analysis, polar decomposition, and Large Deviation Theory (LDT) to achieve accurate reconstruction of weight relationships between models. Notably, MDIR is the first method to achieve perfect scores on both Area-Under-Curve (AUC) and accuracy metrics across different source models on LeaFBench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.06309v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Label Error Detection to Correction: A Modular Framework and Benchmark for Object Detection Datasets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06556</link><description>arXiv:2508.06556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly large and diverse datasets. However, label errors often compromise the quality of these datasets and affect the outcomes of training and benchmark evaluations. Although label error detection methods for object detection datasets now exist, they are typically validated only on synthetic benchmarks or via limited manual inspection. How to correct such errors systematically and at scale remains an open problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label error correction called Rechecked. Building on existing label error detection methods, their error proposals are reviewed with lightweight, crowd-sourced microtasks. We apply Rechecked to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset, for which we crowdsourced high-quality corrected annotations. We detect 18% of missing and inaccurate labels in the original ground truth. We show that current label error detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover hundreds of errors with little human effort compared to annotation from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the label errors, which motivates further research, now enabled by our released benchmark.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.06556v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QuiZSF: A Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06915</link><description>arXiv:2508.06915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of sequential data streams is a cornerstone of modern Web services, supporting applications such as traffic management, user behavior modeling, and online anomaly prevention. However, in many Web environments, new domains emerge rapidly and labeled history data is scarce, which makes zero-shot forecasting particularly challenging. Existing time-series pre-trained models (TSPMs) show promise but they lack the ability to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods are rarely extended beyond text. In this work, we present \textbf{QuiZSF}, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that integrates search and forecasting for time series data. The framework performs search by retrieving structurally similar sequences from a large-scale time-series database, and it performs forecasting by integrating the retrieved knowledge into the target sequence. Specifically, QuiZSF introduces a \textbf{ChronoRAG Base}, a hierarchical tree-structured database that enables scalable and domain-aware retrieval, a \textbf{Multi-grained Series Interaction Learner} that captures fine- and coarse-grained dependencies between target and retrieved sequences, and a \textbf{Model Cooperation Coherer} that adapts retrieved knowledge to TSPMs. This design teaches models to actively perform search, align auxiliary information across modalities, and leverage it for more accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that QuiZSF consistently outperforms strong baselines, ranking first in up to \textbf{87.5\%} of zero-shot forecasting settings while maintaining high efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.06915v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Operational Resilience of CBDC: Threats and Prospects of Formal Validation for Offline Payments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08064</link><description>arXiv:2508.08064v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information and communication technologies are by now employed in most human activities, including economics and finance. Modern computers have reached an extraordinary power in terms of information processing, storage, retrieval, and transmission. However, several results of theoretical computer science imply the impossibility of certifying software quality in general. With the exception of safety-critical systems, this has primarily concerned information processed by confined systems, with limited socio-economic consequences. In the emerging era of technologies for exchanging tokenized assets and digital money over the Internet, such as in particular central bank digital currency (CBDC), even a minor bug could trigger a financial collapse. Although the aforementioned impossibility results cannot be overcome in an absolute sense, there exist formal methods that can provide correctness assertions for software system models under suitable conditions. We advocate their use to validate the operational resilience of software infrastructures enabling CBDC, with special emphasis on offline payments as they constitute a very critical issue.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.08064v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emergent morphogenesis via planar fabrication enabled by a reduced model of composites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08198</link><description>arXiv:2508.08198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to engineer complex three-dimensional shapes from planar sheets with precise, programmable control underpins emerging technologies in soft robotics, reconfigurable devices, and functional materials. Here, we present a reduced-order numerical and experimental framework for a bilayer system consisting of a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic sheet (Shrinky Dink) bonded to a kirigami-patterned, inert plastic layer. Upon uniform heating, the active layer contracts while the patterned layer constrains in-plane stretch but allows out-of-plane bending, yielding programmable 3D morphologies from simple planar precursors. Our approach enables efficient computational design and scalable manufacturing of 3D forms with a single-layer reduced model that captures the coupled mechanics of stretching and bending. Unlike traditional bilayer modeling, our framework collapses the multilayer composite into a single layer of nodes and elements, reducing the degrees of freedom and enabling simulation on a 2D geometry. This is achieved by introducing a novel energy formulation that captures the coupling between in-plane stretch mismatch and out-of-plane bending - extending beyond simple isotropic linear elastic models. Experimentally, we establish a fully planar, repeatable fabrication protocol using a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic and a laser-cut inert plastic layer. The programmed strain mismatch drives an array of 3D morphologies, such as bowls, canoes, and flower petals, all verified by both simulation and physical prototypes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.08198v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BiasGym: Fantastic LLM Biases and How to Find (and Remove) Them</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08855</link><description>arXiv:2508.08855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. However, biased behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce \texttt{BiasGym}, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable framework for reliably and safely injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual associations of biases within LLMs. \texttt{BiasGym} consists of two components: \texttt{BiasInject}, which safely injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while keeping the model frozen, and \texttt{BiasScope}, which leverages these injected signals to identify and reliably steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and generalizes to biases unseen during fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from Italy being `reckless drivers'), showing its utility for both safety interventions and interpretability research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.08855v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Level Safety Continual Projection for Fine-Tuned Large Language Models without Retraining</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09190</link><description>arXiv:2508.09190v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While fine-tuning services drive the rapid expansion of task capabilities in large language models (LLMs), they are often accompanied by the degradation and reorganization of safety-aligned representations, making models more prone to deviating from human preferences and exposing them to emerging jailbreak risks. Existing post-fine-tuning defense methods predominantly rely on single-scale safety correction mechanisms, which struggle to achieve a robust balance among safety, model utility, and continual adaptability. We propose Multi-Level Safety Continual Projection (MSCP), a training-free post-fine-tuning safety enhancement method that implicitly aligns global and localized safety activations through coordinated multi-level representations to isolate sparse neuron clusters governing safety-sensitive behaviors. It then applies composable safety-direction projections without retraining, effectively suppressing harmful outputs under minimal parameter perturbations while preserving task performance and improving alignment with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, we introduce a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety activation clustering mechanism that enables continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.09190v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Generalized Alternating Anderson Acceleration Method</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10158</link><description>arXiv:2508.10158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a generalized alternating Anderson acceleration method, a periodic scheme composed of $t$ fixed-point iteration steps, interleaved with $s$ steps of Anderson acceleration with window size $m$, to solve linear and nonlinear problems. This allows flexibility to use different combinations of fixed-point iteration and Anderson iteration. We present a convergence analysis of the proposed scheme for accelerating the Richardson iteration in the linear case, with a focus on specific parameter choices of interest. Specifically, we prove convergence of the proposed method under contractive fixed-point iteration and provide a sufficient condition for convergence when the Richardson iteration matrix is diagonalizable and noncontractive. To demonstrate the broader applicability of our proposed method, we use it to accelerate Jacobi iteration, Picard iteration, gradient descent, and the alternating direction method of multipliers in solving partial differential equations and nonlinear, nonsmooth optimization problems. The numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the existing windowed Anderson acceleration and alternating Anderson ($s=1$) in terms of iteration number and CPU time for careful choice of parameters $m, s, t$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10158v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Evaluation Framework for Multi-Annotator Tendency Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10393</link><description>arXiv:2508.10393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations. To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10393v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spirals and Beyond: Competitive Plane Search with Multi-Speed Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10793</link><description>arXiv:2508.10793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the worst-case search time for a hidden point target in the plane using multiple mobile agents of differing speeds, all starting from a common origin. The search time is normalized by the target's distance to the origin, following the standard convention in competitive analysis. The goal is to minimize the maximum such normalized time over all target locations, the search cost. As a base case, we extend the known result for a single unit-speed agent, which achieves an optimal cost of about $\mathcal{U}_1 = 17.28935$ via a logarithmic spiral, to $n$ unit-speed agents. We give a symmetric spiral-based algorithm where each agent follows a logarithmic spiral offset by equal angular phases. This yields a search cost independent of which agent finds the target. We provide a closed-form upper bound $\mathcal{U}_n$ for this setting, which we use in our general result. Our main contribution is an upper bound on the worst-case normalized search time for $n$ agents with arbitrary speeds. We give a framework that selects a subset of agents and assigns spiral-type trajectories with speed-dependent angular offsets, again making the search cost independent of which agent reaches the target. A corollary shows that $n$ multi-speed agents (fastest speed 1) can beat $k$ unit-speed agents (cost below $\mathcal{U}_k$) if the geometric mean of their speeds exceeds $\mathcal{U}_n / \mathcal{U}_k$. This means slow agents may be excluded if they lower the mean too much, motivating non-spiral algorithms. We also give new upper bounds for point search in cones and conic complements using a single unit-speed agent. These are then used to design hybrid spiral-directional strategies, which outperform the spiral-based algorithms when some agents are slow. This suggests that spiral-type trajectories may not be optimal in the general multi-speed setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10793v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DREAMS: Preserving both Local and Global Structure in Dimensionality Reduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13747</link><description>arXiv:2508.13747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically designed to preserve either local (e.g., $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g., MDS, PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across eleven real-world datasets, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.13747v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MemoryVLA: Perceptual-Cognitive Memory in Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19236</link><description>arXiv:2508.19236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, LIBERO-5 suites and Mikasa-Robo, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, 96.5%, and 41.2% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge and +11.8 gain on Mikasa-Robo. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

Abstract: Many successful families of generative models leverage a low-dimensional latent distribution that is mapped to a data distribution. Though simple latent distributions are often used, the choice of distribution has a strong impact on model performance. Recent experiments have suggested that the probability distributions produced by quantum processors, which are typically highly correlated and classically intractable, can lead to improved performance on some datasets. However, when and why latent distributions produced by quantum processors can improve performance, and whether these improvements are connected to quantum properties of these distributions, are open questions that we investigate in this work. We show in theory that, under certain conditions, these "quantum latent distributions" enable generative models to produce data distributions that classical latent distributions cannot efficiently produce. We provide intuition as to the underlying mechanisms that could explain a performance advantage on real datasets. Based on this, we perform extensive benchmarking on a synthetic quantum dataset and the QM9 molecular dataset, using both simulated and real photonic quantum processors. We find that the statistics arising from quantum interference lead to improved generative performance compared to classical baselines, suggesting that quantum processors can play a role in expanding the capabilities of deep generative models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19857v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automatic Reviewers Fail to Detect Faulty Reasoning in Research Papers: A New Counterfactual Evaluation Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21422</link><description>arXiv:2508.21422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual dataset and evaluation framework publicly.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.21422v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Social World Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00559</link><description>arXiv:2509.00559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to structure and reason about implicit social contexts, as they lack explicit representations for unobserved dynamics such as intentions, beliefs, and evolving social states. In this paper, we introduce the concept of social world models (SWMs) to characterize the complex social dynamics. To operationalize SWMs, we introduce a novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), which captures the evolving states, actions, and mental states of agents, addressing the lack of explicit structure in traditional free-text-based inputs. Through comprehensive experiments across five social reasoning benchmarks, we show that S3AP significantly enhances LLM performance-achieving a +51% improvement on FANToM over OpenAI's o1. Our ablations further reveal that these gains are driven by the explicit modeling of hidden mental states, which proves more effective than a wide range of baseline methods. Finally, we introduce an algorithm for social world models using S3AP, which enables AI agents to build models of their interlocutors and predict their next actions and mental states. Empirically, S3AP-enabled social world models yield up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA multi-turn social interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.00559v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FLM-Audio: Natural Monologues Improves Native Full-Duplex Chatbots via Dual Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02521</link><description>arXiv:2509.02521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models aim to listen and speak simultaneously, delivering rapid responses to dynamic user input. Among different solutions to full-duplexity, a native solution merges multiple channels in each time step, achieving the lowest latency. However, prevailing designs break down the textual monologue sentences for word-level alignment with audio streams, which degrades language modeling abilities. To help address this issue, we introduce "contiguous monologues", which are composed by continuous sentences and "waiting" intervals, mimicking human-like cognitive behavior in dialogs. We find a proper training paradigm to be critical for semantically aligning contiguous monologues with audio. To this end, we develop a "dual" training paradigm that alternates the position of the monologues, either leading or trailing the audio, across different training stages. A combination of our contiguous monologue and dual training strategy is applied in developing FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog chatbot with native full-duplexity. As confirmed by experimental results, FLM-Audio achieves superior response qualities and chatting experiences while requiring significantly less training data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.02521v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TRACE: Unlocking Effective CXL Bandwidth via Lossless Compression and Precision Scaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03377</link><description>arXiv:2509.03377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM inference is increasingly limited by memory bandwidth, and the bottleneck worsens at long context as the KV cache grows. CXL memory adds capacity to offload weights and KV, but its link and device-side DDR bandwidth are far below HBM, so decoding stalls once traffic shifts to the CXL tier. Many CXL controllers are starting to add generic \emph{lossless} compression, yet applying commodity codecs directly to standard word-major LLM tensors is largely ineffective, especially for token-major KV streams. We propose TRACE (\textbf{T}raffic-\textbf{R}educed \textbf{A}rchitecture for \textbf{C}ompression and \textbf{E}lasticity), which preserves the unmodified CXL.mem interface but changes the device-internal representation. It stores tensors in a channel-major, disaggregated bit-plane layout, and applies a KV-specific transform before compression, converting mixed-field words into low-entropy plane streams that commodity codecs can compress. The same substrate enables precision-proportional fetch by reading only the required bit-planes. Across public LLMs, TRACE reduces BF16 weight footprint by 25.2\% and BF16 KV footprint by 46.9\% losslessly, with per-layer KV ratios peaking at 2.69$\times$. In trace-driven system modeling, once KV spills to CXL, GPT-OSS-120B-MXFP4 improves throughput at 128k tokens from 16.28 to 68.99 tok/s (4.24$\times$). DRAMSim3 shows up to 40.3\% lower DRAM access energy under plane-aligned fetch. A 7\,nm SystemVerilog implementation sustains 256\,GB/s device bandwidth. Relative to a CXL controller with generic inline lossless compression, TRACE only adds 7.2\% area, 4.7\% power, and 6.0\% load-to-use latency at 2\,GHz and 0.7\,V.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.03377v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SpiderNets: Vision Models Predict Human Fear From Aversive Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04889</link><description>arXiv:2509.04889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phobias are common and impairing, and exposure therapy, which involves confronting patients with fear-provoking visual stimuli, is the most effective treatment. Scalable computerized exposure therapy requires automated prediction of fear directly from image content to adapt stimulus selection and treatment intensity. Whether such predictions can be made reliably and generalize across individuals and stimuli, however, remains unknown. Here we show that pretrained convolutional and transformer vision models, adapted via transfer learning, accurately predict group-level perceived fear for spider-related images, even when evaluated on new people and new images, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) below 10 units on the 0-100 fear scale. Visual explanation analyses indicate that predictions are driven by spider-specific regions in the images. Learning-curve analyses show that transformer models are data efficient and approach performance saturation with the available data (~300 images). Prediction errors increase for very low and very high fear levels and within specific categories of images. These results establish transparent, data-driven fear estimation from images, laying the groundwork for adaptive digital mental health tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.04889v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI for Scientific Discovery is a Social Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06580</link><description>arXiv:2509.06580v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly applied to scientific research, but its benefits remain unevenly distributed across different communities and disciplines. While technical challenges such as limited data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computational resources are already well known, social and institutional factors are often the primary constraints. Narratives emphasizing autonomous "AI scientists," the underrecognition of data and infrastructure work, misaligned incentives, and gaps between domain experts and machine learning researchers all limit the impact of AI on scientific discovery. Four interconnected challenges are highlighted in this paper: community coordination, the misalignment of research priorities with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and infrastructure inequities. We argue that addressing these challenges requires not only technical innovations but also intentional community-building efforts, cross-disciplinary education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for achieving technical progress.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06580v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAFFLES: Reasoning-based Attribution of Faults for LLM Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06822</link><description>arXiv:2509.06822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of complex, interconnected long-horizon LLM systems has made it incredibly tricky to identify where and when these systems break down. Evaluation capabilities that currently exist today are limited in that they often focus on simple metrics, end-to-end outcomes, and are dependent on the perspectives of humans. In order to match the increasing complexity of these many component systems, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason, probe, iterate, and understand the nuanced logic passing through these systems. In this paper, we present RAFFLES, an offline evaluation architecture that incorporates iterative reasoning. Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using a central Judge to systematically identify faults and a set of specialized Evaluators to assess the quality of the candidate faults as well as rationales of the Judge. We evaluated RAFFLES with several benchmarks - the Who&amp;amp;When dataset to identify step-level faults in multi-agent systems and the ReasonEval datasets to diagnose step-level mathematical reasoning errors. RAFFLES outperforms strong baselines, achieving an accuracy of over 20% and 50% on the Who&amp;amp;When Hand-Crafted and Algorithmically-Generated datasets, and over 80% on the ReasonEval datasets. These results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual review.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06822v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging AI Agents for Autonomous Networks: A Reference Architecture and Empirical Studies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08312</link><description>arXiv:2509.08312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities--fulfilling TM Forum's vision of self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing systems that deliver zero-wait, zero-touch, and zero-fault services. This work bridges the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent, we validate this framework's transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR sub-6 GHz while achieving 4% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 85% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) optimization. These improvements confirm the architecture's viability in overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling capabilities toward next-generation objectives.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.08312v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HyperMOOC: Augmenting MOOC Videos with Concept-based Embedded Visualizations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08404</link><description>arXiv:2509.08404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become increasingly popular worldwide. However, learners primarily rely on watching videos, easily losing knowledge context and reducing learning effectiveness. We propose HyperMOOC, a novel approach augmenting MOOC videos with concept-based embedded visualizations to help learners maintain knowledge context. Informed by expert interviews and literature review, HyperMOOC employs multi-glyph designs for different knowledge types and multi-stage interactions for deeper understanding. Using a timeline-based radial visualization, learners can grasp cognitive paths of concepts and navigate courses through hyperlink-based interactions. We evaluated HyperMOOC through a user study with 36 MOOC learners and interviews with two instructors. Results demonstrate that HyperMOOC enhances learners' learning effect and efficiency on MOOCs, with participants showing higher satisfaction and improved course understanding compared to traditional video-based learning approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.08404v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feature Space Topology Control via Hopkins Loss</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11154</link><description>arXiv:2509.11154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature space topology refers to the organization of samples within the feature space. Modifying this topology can be beneficial in machine learning applications, including dimensionality reduction, generative modeling, transfer learning, and robustness to adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel loss function, Hopkins loss, which leverages the Hopkins statistic to enforce a desired feature space topology, which is in contrast to existing topology-related methods that aim to preserve input feature topology. We evaluate the effectiveness of Hopkins loss on speech, text, and image data in two scenarios: classification and dimensionality reduction using nonlinear bottleneck autoencoders. Our experiments show that integrating Hopkins loss into classification or dimensionality reduction has only a small impact on classification performance while providing the benefit of modifying feature topology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11154v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EgoMem: Lifelong Memory Agent for Full-duplex Omnimodal Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11914</link><description>arXiv:2509.11914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce EgoMem, the first lifelong memory agent tailored for full-duplex models that process real-time omnimodal streams. EgoMem enables real-time models to recognize multiple users directly from raw audiovisual streams, to provide personalized response, and to maintain long-term knowledge of users' facts, preferences, and social relationships extracted from audiovisual history. EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and (iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot, the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized dialogs, establishing a strong baseline for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11914v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Information Loss and Disparate Effects in Network Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12396</link><description>arXiv:2509.12396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extensive line of work studies fairness interventions for network embeddings, but less is known about their baseline behavior. In this work, we ask: how do baseline embeddings (without fairness interventions) produce disparate effects at the representation level? We analyze the asymptotic behavior of low-dimensional embeddings on stochastic block model (SBM) graphs, which encode both homophily and group structure. We characterize exact conditions under which embeddings cause information loss, showing that the amount of information loss depends directly on the graph's density and assortativity. Notably, very different graphs can produce identical embeddings in the limit, and this non-invertibility disproportionately affects smaller and sparser communities. As a result, simple downstream tasks, such as link prediction, introduce higher error rates for these communities, helping explain disparities widely observed in practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.12396v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DF-LLaVA: Unlocking MLLMs for Synthetic Image Detection via Knowledge Injection and Conflict-Driven Self-Reflection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14957</link><description>arXiv:2509.14957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose DF-LLaVA, a novel and effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first mines latent knowledge from the MLLM itself and then injects it into the model via fine-tuning. During inference, conflict signals arising from the model's predictions activate a self-reflection process, leading to the final refined responses. This framework allows LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and explainability in synthetic image detection.

Our debiasing approach exhibits remarkable flexibility, seamlessly accommodating a broad spectrum of practically relevant loss functions across both binary and multi-class classification settings. By carefully combining our estimators with standard techniques, we improve sample complexity guarantees for a large class of losses of practical relevance. We also empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed approach across a diverse array of benchmark datasets, demonstrating compelling empirical advantages over standard baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.15145v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Improvement of Language Models by Post-Training on Multi-Agent Debate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15172</link><description>arXiv:2509.15172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-improvement, where models improve beyond their current performance without external supervision, remains a challenge. The core difficulty is sourcing a training signal stronger than what the model itself can currently produce. Majority voting has been shown to provide such a signal by aggregating over multiple samples, helping mitigate some of the inconsistencies in LM reasoning. In this work, we show that multi-agent debate--where models collaborate and exchange reasoning over multiple rounds--provides an even richer signal than single-round majority voting. We introduce Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA), which uses reinforcement learning (RL) to post-train models to effectively utilize multi-agent debate. We find that preference learning over full reasoning traces, learning to differentiate between majority and minority reasoning, is more effective than binary consensus rewards or SFT-based approaches for leveraging these debate signals. This produces three key improvements: models are (1) better at utilizing the multi-agent debate setting (+26.87% on MATH), (2) individually more accurate (+21.51% on MathQA), and (3) more self-consistent (+27.6% on GSM8K). We also see strong generalization to unseen benchmarks (+16.3% on GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.15172v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Impact of Phonetics on Speaker Identity in Adversarial Voice Attack</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15437</link><description>arXiv:2509.15437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial perturbations in speech pose a serious threat to automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker verification by introducing subtle waveform modifications that remain imperceptible to humans but can significantly alter system outputs. While targeted attacks on end-to-end ASR models have been widely studied, the phonetic basis of these perturbations and their effect on speaker identity remain underexplored. In this work, we analyze adversarial audio at the phonetic level and show that perturbations exploit systematic confusions such as vowel centralization and consonant substitutions. These distortions not only mislead transcription but also degrade phonetic cues critical for speaker verification, leading to identity drift. Using DeepSpeech as our ASR target, we generate targeted adversarial examples and evaluate their impact on speaker embeddings across genuine and impostor samples. Results across 16 phonetically diverse target phrases demonstrate that adversarial audio induces both transcription errors and identity drift, highlighting the need for phonetic-aware defenses to ensure the robustness of ASR and speaker recognition systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.15437v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Thinking in cocktail party: Chain-of-Thought and reinforcement learning for target speaker automatic speech recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15612</link><description>arXiv:2509.15612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Target Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition (TS-ASR) aims to transcribe the speech of a specified target speaker from multi-speaker mixtures in cocktail party scenarios. Recent advancement of Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) has already brought some new insights to TS-ASR. However, significant room for optimization remains for the TS-ASR task within the LALMs architecture. While Chain of Thoughts (CoT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven effective in certain speech tasks, TS-ASR, which requires the model to deeply comprehend speech signals, differentiate various speakers, and handle overlapping utterances is particularly well-suited to a reasoning-guided approach. Therefore, we propose a novel framework that incorporates CoT and RL training into TS-ASR for performance improvement. A novel CoT dataset of TS-ASR is constructed, and the TS-ASR model is first trained on regular data and then fine-tuned on CoT data. Finally, the model is further trained with RL using selected data to enhance generalized reasoning capabilities. Experiment results show a significant improvement of TS-ASR performance with CoT and RL training, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed CoT and RL training methods adapted for the TS-ASR task.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.15612v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FESTA: Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment of Multimodal LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16648</link><description>arXiv:2509.16648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate trust assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generated predictions, which can enable selective prediction and improve user confidence, is challenging due to the diverse multi-modal input paradigms. We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.16648v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accurate and Efficient Low-Rank Model Merging in Core Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17786</link><description>arXiv:2509.17786v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges associated with merging low-rank adaptations of large neural networks. With the rise of parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), model fine-tuning has become more accessible. While fine-tuning models with LoRA is highly efficient, existing merging methods often sacrifice this efficiency by merging fully-sized weight matrices. We propose the Core Space merging framework, which enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis, thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while utilizing a fraction of the computational resources.

Abstract: We propose a scalable framework for solving the Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem in large graphs using projected gradient ascent on quadratic objectives. Our approach is differentiable and leverages GPUs for gradient-based optimization. It is not a machine learning method and does not require training data. Starting from a continuous relaxation of the classical quadratic binary formulation, we present a parallelized strategy that explores multiple initialization vectors in batch. We analyze the relaxed objective, showing it is convex and has fixed-points corresponding to local optima, particularly at boundary points, highlighting a key challenge in non-convex optimization. To improve exploration, we introduce a lifted quadratic formulation that over-parameterizes the solution space. We also provide a theoretical characterization of these lifted fixed-points. Finally, we propose DECO, a dimension-alternating algorithm that switches between the unlifted and lifted formulations, combined with importance-based degree initialization and a population-based evolutionary hyper-parameter search. Experiments on diverse graph families show that our methods attain comparable or superior performance relative to recent neural networks and GPU-accelerated sampling approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.18612v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Latent Iterative Refinement Flow: A Geometric Constrained Approach for Few-Shot Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19903</link><description>arXiv:2509.19903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching models trained with limited data often tend to memorize the training data instead of generalization, leading to severely reduced diversity. In this paper, we provide a dynamical perspective and identify this ``collapse-to-memorization'' phenomenon as a consequence of the \emph{velocity field collapse}, where the learned field degenerates into isolated point attractors and trap the sampling trajectories. Inspired by this novel view, we introduce \textbf{{\BLUE L}atent {\BLUE I}terative {\BLUE R}efinement {\BLUE F}low ({\BLUE LIRF})}, a geometry-aware framework for from-scratch training of diffusion models in the limited-data regime.
  By exploiting the intrinsic geometry of a semantically aligned latent space, LIRF progressively densifies the training data manifold via a \emph{generation--correction--augmentation} closed loop, thereby effectively resolving the velocity field collapse. Theoretical guarantee on the convergence of this manifold densification procedure is also provided. Experiments on FFHQ subsets and Low-Shot datasets demonstrate the advantageous performance of LIRF over existing diffusion models for limited-data generation, achieving significantly higher diversity and recall, with comparably good generative performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19903v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Atoms of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20784</link><description>arXiv:2509.20784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental representational units (FRUs) of large language models (LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce Atom Theory to systematically define, evaluate, and identify such FRUs, which we term atoms. Building on the atomic inner product (AIP), a non-Euclidean metric that captures the underlying geometry of LLM representations, we formally define atoms and propose two key criteria for ideal atoms: faithfulness ($R^2$) and stability ($q^*$). We further prove that atoms are identifiable under threshold-activated sparse autoencoders (TSAEs). Empirically, we uncover a pervasive representation shift in LLMs and demonstrate that the AIP corrects this shift to capture the underlying representational geometry, thereby grounding Atom Theory. We find that two widely used units, neurons and features, fail to qualify as ideal atoms: neurons are faithful ($R^2=1$) but unstable ($q^*=0.5\%$), while features are more stable ($q^*=68.2\%$) but unfaithful ($R^2=48.8\%$). To find atoms of LLMs, leveraging atom identifiability under TSAEs, we show via large-scale experiments that reliable atom identification occurs only when the TSAE capacity matches the data scale. Guided by this insight, we identify FRUs with near-perfect faithfulness ($R^2=99.9\%$) and stability ($q^*=99.8\%$) across layers of Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, satisfying the criteria of ideal atoms statistically. Further analysis confirms that these atoms align with theoretical expectations and exhibit substantially higher monosemanticity. Overall, we propose and validate Atom Theory as a foundation for understanding the internal representations of LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/ChenhuiHu/towards_atoms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.20784v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LAVA: Explainability for Unsupervised Latent Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21149</link><description>arXiv:2509.21149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models are drivers of scientific discovery, yet are difficult to interpret, as their output is often a multidimensional embedding rather than a well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning uncovers how input features contribute to predictions, its unsupervised counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned embeddings. However, adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning provide either single-sample or dataset-summary explanations, remaining too fine-grained or reductive to be meaningful, and cannot explain embeddings without mapping functions. To bridge this gap, we propose LAVA, a post-hoc model-agnostic method to explain local embedding organization through feature covariation in the original input data. LAVA explanations comprise modules, capturing local subpatterns of input feature correlation that reoccur globally across the embeddings. LAVA delivers stable explanations at a desired level of granularity, revealing domain-relevant patterns such as visual parts of images or disease signals in cellular processes, otherwise missed by existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21149v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] It's Not You, It's Clipping: A Soft Trust-Region via Probability Smoothing for LLM RL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21282</link><description>arXiv:2509.21282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information, introduces gradient discontinuities and can prevent exploration of better policies. Inspired by label smoothing, we propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO). PSPO smooths current policy probabilities toward the behaviour policy before computing importance ratios, creating a soft trust region that preserves gradients while preventing destabilising updates. Unlike prior soft clipping approaches that use sigmoid-based transformations which can suffer from vanishing gradients and saturation, our method uses a linear interpolation, providing simpler and more robust gradient preservation.
  Empirically, GR-PSPO outperforms clipping and sigmoid-based alternatives on mathematical reasoning benchmarks when refining models with prior domain knowledge, achieving an accuracy of 79.9% on GSM8K and 59.6% on MATH for Qwen2-Math-1.5B.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21282v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Filtering with Confidence: When Data Augmentation Meets Conformal Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21479</link><description>arXiv:2509.21479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications, synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical: effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection, showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40 percentage points (pp) in $F_1$ score over unaugmented baselines, and 4~pp over other filtered augmentation baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21479v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Incentives in Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21612</link><description>arXiv:2509.21612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning promises significant sample-efficiency gains by pooling data across multiple agents, yet incentive misalignment is an obstacle: each update is costly to the contributor but boosts every participant. We introduce a game-theoretic framework that captures heterogeneous data: an agent's utility depends on who supplies each sample, not just how many. Agents aim to meet a PAC-style accuracy threshold at minimal personal cost. We show that uncoordinated play yields pathologies: pure equilibria may not exist, and the best equilibrium can be arbitrarily more costly than cooperation. To steer collaboration, we analyze the cost-minimizing contribution vector, prove that computing it is NP-hard, and derive a polynomial-time linear program that achieves a logarithmic approximation. Finally, pairing the LP with a simple pay what you contribute rule, where each agent receives a payment equal to its sample cost, yields a mechanism that is strategy-proof and, within the class of contribution-based transfers, is unique.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21612v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lifelong Learning with Behavior Consolidation for Vehicle Routing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21765</link><description>arXiv:2509.21765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed. LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way. To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue, maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21765v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SimulSense: Sense-Driven Interpreting for Efficient Simultaneous Speech Translation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21932</link><description>arXiv:2509.21932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21932v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Collaborative Belief Reasoning with LLMs for Efficient Multi-Agent Collaboration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21981</link><description>arXiv:2509.21981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents--a crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a Collaborative Belief World--an internal representation jointly modeling the physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables agents to parse external open-world knowledge into structured beliefs via a symbolic belief representation module, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World significantly reduces communication costs by 64-79% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21981v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards a more realistic evaluation of machine learning models for bearing fault diagnosis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22267</link><description>arXiv:2509.22267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage. This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU), and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22267v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ChatInject: Abusing Chat Templates for Prompt Injection in LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22830</link><description>arXiv:2509.22830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject, an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates, thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies. Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13% to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2) chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22830v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Separability of Information in Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23937</link><description>arXiv:2509.23937v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models transform noise into data by injecting information that was captured in their neural network during the training phase. In this paper, we ask: \textit{what} is this information? We find that, in pixel-space diffusion models, (1) a large fraction of the total information in the neural network is committed to reconstructing small-scale perceptual details of the image, and (2) the correlations between images and their class labels are informed by the semantic content of the images, and are largely agnostic to the low-level details. We argue that these properties are intrinsically tied to the manifold structure of the data itself. Finally, we show that these facts explain the efficacy of classifier-free guidance: the guidance vector amplifies the mutual information between images and conditioning signals early in the generative process, influencing semantic structure, but tapers out as perceptual details are filled in.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.23937v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dual Mechanisms of Value Expression: Intrinsic vs. Prompted Values in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24319</link><description>arXiv:2509.24319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models can express values in two main ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts. Given their widespread use in value alignment, it is paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on distinct mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream, and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value vectors. We demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common components crucial for inducing value expression, generalizing across languages and reconstructing theoretical inter-value correlations in the model's internal representations. Yet, as these mechanisms also possess unique elements that fulfill distinct roles, they lead to different degrees of response diversity (intrinsic &gt; prompted) and value steerability (prompted &gt; intrinsic). In particular, components unique to the intrinsic mechanism promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas those specific to the prompted mechanism strengthen instruction following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24319v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fidel-TS: A High-Fidelity Multimodal Benchmark for Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24789</link><description>arXiv:2509.24789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress. Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data contamination in the age of LLMs to the temporal and description leakage prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity, leak-free and causally sound design, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing data from live APIs. Our experiments reveal the flaws of the previous benchmarks and the biases in model evaluation, providing new insights into multiple existing forecasting models and LLMs across various evaluation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24789v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal-Adapter: Taming Text-to-Image Diffusion for Faithful Counterfactual Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24798</link><description>arXiv:2509.24798v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91% MAE reduction on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and 87% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24798v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] YOLO26: Key Architectural Enhancements and Performance Benchmarking for Real-Time Object Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25164</link><description>arXiv:2509.25164v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of Ultralytics YOLO26(also called as YOLOv26), highlighting its key architectural enhancements and performance benchmarking for real-time object detection. YOLO26, released in September 2025, stands as the newest and most advanced member of the YOLO family, purpose-built to deliver efficiency, accuracy, and deployment readiness on edge and low-power devices. The paper sequentially details architectural innovations of YOLO26, including the removal of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), adoption of end-to-end NMS-free inference, integration of ProgLoss and Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and the introduction of the MuSGD optimizer for stable convergence. Beyond architecture, the study positions YOLO26 as a multi-task framework, supporting object detection, instance segmentation, pose/keypoints estimation, oriented detection, and classification. We present performance benchmarks of YOLO26 on edge devices such as NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Orin, comparing its results with YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12, YOLOv13, and transformer-based detectors(RF-DETR and RT-DETR). This paper further explores real-time deployment pathways, flexible export options (ONNX, TensorRT, CoreML, TFLite), and quantization for INT8/FP16. Practical use cases of YOLO26 across robotics, manufacturing, and IoT are highlighted to demonstrate cross-industry adaptability. Finally, insights on deployment efficiency and broader implications are discussed, with future directions for YOLO26 and the YOLO lineage outlined.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25164v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IRIS: Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25562</link><description>arXiv:2509.25562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary to recent findings in math and code reasoning, we show that minimizing self-certainty, rather than maximizing it, improves image generation. We observe that autoregressive T2I models with higher certainty are likely to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human preferences, and models with lower certainty are likely to generate vivid images rich in detail. Based on this observation, we propose IRIS(Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves performance superior to those trained by individual external rewards, and matching those trained by ensemble external rewards. IRIS also incentivizes the emergence of nuanced CoT reasoning for high-quality image generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25562v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Think Less, Label Better: Multi-Stage Domain-Grounded Synthetic Data Generation for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models in Telecommunications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25736</link><description>arXiv:2509.25736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale, high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However, generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting, where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever, base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25736v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Generalized Information Bottleneck Theory of Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26327</link><description>arXiv:2509.26327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a \textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts. Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU} activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding of adversarial robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26327v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TAP: Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization of Multi-Task and Multi-Modal Foundation Models in Federated Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26524</link><description>arXiv:2509.26524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), local personalization of models has received significant attention, yet personalized fine-tuning of foundation models remains a significant challenge. In particular, there is a lack of understanding in the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize foundation models in settings that are heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and modalities. To address this gap, we propose TAP (Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization), which has two key features: (i) leveraging mismatched model architectures between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations when it benefits a client's local tasks; (ii) engaging in post-FL knowledge distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising personalization. In developing TAP, we introduce the first convergence analysis of federated foundation model training at the server under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to state-of-the-art federated personalization baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26524v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Approximation Algorithms for Fair Influence Maximization under Maximin Constraint</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26579</link><description>arXiv:2509.26579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fair Influence Maximization (FIM) seeks to mitigate disparities in influence across different groups and has recently garnered increasing attention. A widely adopted notion of fairness in FIM is the maximin constraint, which directly requires maximizing the utility (influenced ratio within a group) of the worst-off group. Despite its intuitive formulation, designing efficient algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees remains challenging, as the maximin objective does not satisfy submodularity, a key property for designing approximate algorithms in traditional influence maximization settings. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a two-step optimization framework consisting of Inner-group Maximization (IGM) and Across-group Maximization (AGM). We first prove that the influence spread within any individual group remains submodular, enabling effective optimization within groups. Based on this, IGM applies a greedy approach to pick high-quality seeds for each group. In the second step, AGM coordinates seed selection across groups by introducing two strategies: Uniform Selection (US) and Greedy Selection (GS). We prove that AGM-GS holds a $(1-1/e-\varepsilon)$ approximation to the optimal solution when groups are completely disconnected, while AGM-US guarantees a roughly $\frac{1}{m}(1-1/e-\varepsilon)$ lower bound regardless of the group structure, with $m$ denoting the number of groups.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26579v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FedLLM-Align: Feature Extraction From Heterogeneous Clients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00065</link><description>arXiv:2510.00065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains, e.g., healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the potential heterogeneity of tabular data across clients, in practical settings, where schema mismatches and incompatible feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge, this paper proposes FedLLM-Align, a federated learning framework that leverages pretrained transformer based language models for feature extraction. Towards this objective, FedLLM-Align serializes tabular records into text and derives semantically aligned embeddings from a pretrained LLM encoder, e.g, DistilBERT, facilitating lightweight local classifier heads that can be trained in a federated manner using standard aggregation schemes, e.g., FedAvg, while keeping all raw data records local. To quantify the merits and trade-offs of FedLLM-Align, we evaluate the proposed framework on binary classification tasks from two different domains: i) Coronary heart disease prediction on partitioned Framingham Heart Study data, and ii) Customer churn prediction on a financial dataset. FedLLM-Align outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 25% in terms of the F1 score, under simulated schema heterogeneity, and achieves a 65% reduction in the communication overhead. These results establish FedLLM-Align as a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient approach for federated training based on clients with heterogeneous tabular datasets, commonly encountered in practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.00065v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Thoughtbubbles: an Unsupervised Method for Parallel Thinking in Latent Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00219</link><description>arXiv:2510.00219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers train them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot be applied during pretraining and rely solely on serially-generated, natural-language verbalization. In this work, we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete residual streams. Thus, tokens requiring more computation can form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only language modeling loss. Using half of the training budget, Thoughtbubbles outperforms the perplexity and zero-shot evals of both standard decoder LMs and those using non-adaptive parallel computation approaches. These results hold across model sizes from 150M to 1.9B. Thoughtbubbles achieves competitive GSM8K results using half of the baseline's token budget. The implicit nature of our method enables models to begin learning adaptive computation at pretraining time, paving the way to unified train-time and test-time scaling behaviors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.00219v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] It Takes Two: Your GRPO Is Secretly DPO</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00977</link><description>arXiv:2510.00977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a prominent reinforcement learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models. Different from critic-based methods such as PPO, GRPO estimates the advantage function using group-level statistics to reduce the variance of policy gradient estimators. While the prevailing view attributes GRPO's effectiveness to large group sizes for accurate advantage estimation, we propose a different perspective. We demonstrate that the efficacy of GRPO stems from its implicit contrastive objective in the optimization, which helps reduce variance via the control variate method. This perspective establishes a fundamental connection between GRPO and DPO, wherein group size influences only the Monte Carlo estimators of the contrastive objective. To validate this, we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration permissible under the contrastive framework but typically considered insufficient for reward normalization. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of 2-GRPO and empirically validate its effectiveness: 2-GRPO retains 98.1% of the performance of 16-GRPO, while requiring only 12.5% of the rollouts and 21% of the training time. This study offers a new perspective for future algorithm design in LLM post-training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.00977v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Well Can Preference Optimization Generalize Under Noisy Feedback?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01458</link><description>arXiv:2510.01458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments. This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization, providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise, such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01458v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] InvThink: Towards AI Safety via Inverse Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01569</link><description>arXiv:2510.01569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives language models the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1) enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our paper reveals three key findings: (i) InvThink demonstrates significantly improved safety reasoning as model size scales, compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing applications (medicine, finance, law) and agentic risk scenarios (blackmail, murder), achieving up to 17.8% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt. We further equip InvThink with supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These results suggest that InvThink provides a scalable and generalizable path toward safer, more capable language models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01569v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PENEX: AdaBoost-Inspired Neural Network Regularization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02107</link><description>arXiv:2510.02107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential loss, which penalizes misclassified data points more severely than other loss functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods, making it a practical objective for training neural networks. We demonstrate that PENEX effectively increases margins of data points, which can be translated into a generalization bound. Empirically, across computer vision and language tasks, PENEX improves neural network generalization in low-data regimes, often matching or outperforming established regularizers at comparable computational cost. Our results highlight the potential of the exponential loss beyond its application in AdaBoost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02107v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Test-Time Anchoring for Discrete Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02291</link><description>arXiv:2510.02291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While continuous diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework for jointly modeling text and images. Beyond unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and principled training-free guidance, making it well-suited for posterior sampling. Existing approaches to posterior sampling using discrete diffusion face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS), built on two key innovations: quantized expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. APS achieves state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers on both linear and nonlinear inverse problems across the standard image benchmarks. We demonstrate the generality of APS through training-free stylization and text-guided editing. We further apply APS to a large-scale diffusion language model, showing consistent improvement in question answering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02291v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VideoNSA: Native Sparse Attention Scales Video Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02295</link><description>arXiv:2510.02295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1) reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4) the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, but their large memory and compute demands hinder deployment. Ternarization has gained attention as a promising compression technique, delivering substantial size reduction and high computational efficiency. However, its potential in the post-training quantization (PTQ) setting remains underexplored, due to the challenge of training-free parameter optimization and the quantization difficulty posed by outliers and dispersed weights. To address these issues, we propose PT$^2$-LLM, a post-training ternarization framework tailored for LLMs. At its core is an Asymmetric Ternary Quantizer equipped with a two-stage refinement pipeline: (1) Iterative Ternary Fitting (ITF), which alternates between optimal ternary grid construction and flexible rounding to minimize quantization error, and (2) Activation-aware Grid Alignment (AGA), which further refines the ternary grid to better match full-precision outputs. In addition, we propose a plug-and-play Structural Similarity-based Reordering (SSR) strategy that leverages inter-column structural similarity to ease quantization and mitigate outlier effects, further enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PT$^2$-LLM delivers competitive performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) 2-bit PTQ methods with lower memory cost, while also accelerating both prefill and decoding to achieve end-to-end speedup.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) advance video understanding but operate under tight computational budgets, making performance dependent on selecting a small, high-quality subset of frames. Existing frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, fail to adapt to variations in content density or task complexity. To address this, we present FrameOracle, a lightweight, plug-and-play module that predicts both (1) which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are needed. FrameOracle is trained via a curriculum that progresses from weak proxy signals, such as cross-modal similarity, to stronger supervision with FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA dataset with validated keyframe annotations specifying minimal sufficient frames per question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks show that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4 frames without accuracy loss. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it reduces inputs to 13.9 frames on average while improving accuracy by 1.5%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable video understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03584v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Security Analysis of Ponzi Schemes in Ethereum Smart Contracts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03819</link><description>arXiv:2510.03819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of blockchain technology has precipitated the widespread adoption of Ethereum and smart contracts across a variety of sectors. However, this has also given rise to numerous fraudulent activities, with many speculators embedding Ponzi schemes within smart contracts, resulting in significant financial losses for investors. Currently, there is a lack of effective methods for identifying and analyzing such new types of fraudulent activities. This paper categorizes these scams into four structural types and explores the intrinsic characteristics of Ponzi scheme contract source code from a program analysis perspective. The Mythril tool is employed to conduct static and dynamic analyses of representative cases, thereby revealing their vulnerabilities and operational mechanisms. Furthermore, this paper employs shell scripts and command patterns to conduct batch detection of open-source smart contract code, thereby unveiling the common characteristics of Ponzi scheme smart contracts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03819v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unmasking Backdoors: An Explainable Defense via Gradient-Attention Anomaly Scoring for Pre-trained Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04347</link><description>arXiv:2510.04347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly when fine-tuned on large, domain-relevant datasets. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed malicious behaviors using trigger patterns in the training data. These triggers remain dormant during normal usage, but, when activated, can cause targeted misclassifications. In this work, we investigate the internal behavior of backdoored pre-trained encoder-based language models, focusing on the consistent shift in attention and gradient attribution when processing poisoned inputs; where the trigger token dominates both attention and gradient signals, overriding the surrounding context. We propose an inference-time defense that constructs anomaly scores by combining token-level attention and gradient information. Extensive experiments on text classification tasks across diverse backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces attack success rates compared to existing baselines. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability-driven analysis of the scoring mechanism, shedding light on trigger localization and the robustness of the proposed defense.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04347v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Context Engineering: Evolving Contexts for Self-Improving Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618</link><description>arXiv:2510.04618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptation -- modifying inputs with instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured, incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory), consistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost. Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model. These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable, efficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04618v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training Dynamics Impact Post-Training Quantization Robustness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06213</link><description>arXiv:2510.06213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness, demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can improve quantization quality at scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06213v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantifying Data Contamination in Psychometric Evaluations of LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07175</link><description>arXiv:2510.07175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies apply psychometric questionnaires to Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess high-level psychological constructs such as values, personality, moral foundations, and dark traits. Although prior work has raised concerns about possible data contamination from psychometric inventories, which may threaten the reliability of such evaluations, there has been no systematic attempt to quantify the extent of this contamination. To address this gap, we propose a framework to systematically measure data contamination in psychometric evaluations of LLMs, evaluating three aspects: (1) item memorization, (2) evaluation memorization, and (3) target score matching. Applying this framework to 21 models from major families and four widely used psychometric inventories, we provide evidence that popular inventories such as the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40) exhibit strong contamination, where models not only memorize items but can also adjust their responses to achieve specific target scores.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07175v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Unintended Trade-off of AI Alignment:Balancing Hallucination Mitigation and Safety in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07775</link><description>arXiv:2510.07775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07775v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Post-Norm can Resharpen Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08341</link><description>arXiv:2510.08341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Length Generalization is the essential capacity of autonomous agents to perform tasks in longer contexts than those encountered during training. To systematically study this feat, we test how well models can approximate the next token distributions in algorithmic tasks. This is to take into account the realistic possibility of multiple next tokens being legal. We present a prototypical benchmark for this line of study: in the Set Complement Task, the model needs to output a uniform distribution over tokens not in the input. We prove a theorem that states simple transformers can length generalize on this task, however, with performance degradation due to attention dispersion. A mechanistic reading of how dispersion takes effect lets us discover a remedy: Post-Norm can Resharpen Attention. We present experimental evidence to support this idea. We also show that Exponential Moving Averages can help the issue of noisy gradients that arises when many next tokens are legal. We validate the general applicability of our proposed methods on a suite of formal language experiments. Our source code will be available upon publication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08341v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Which Heads Matter for Reasoning?

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors via extended chain-of-thought generation that are highly fragile to information loss during decoding, creating critical challenges for KV cache compression. Existing token-dropping methods directly disrupt reasoning chains by removing intermediate steps, while head-reallocation methods, designed for retrieval tasks, fail to preserve the heads essential for generative reasoning. However, no existing method can identify which attention heads genuinely maintain reasoning consistency and control generation termination. To address this, we propose RLKV, which uses reinforcement learning as a probe to discover which heads contribute to reasoning quality by directly optimizing their cache usage against actual generation outcomes. This discovery naturally leads to an efficient compression strategy: we allocate full KV cache to reasoning-critical heads while aggressively compressing others. Experiments reveal that a fraction of heads proves essential for reasoning, enabling 20--50% cache reduction with near-lossless performance and up to 1.21x speedup.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08525v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GraphGhost: Tracing Structures Behind Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08613</link><description>arXiv:2510.08613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities on structured tasks, yet the internal mechanisms underlying such behaviors remain poorly understood. Existing interpretation methods mainly focus on token-level attributions, which provide limited insight into multi-step reasoning inside the model. We propose GraphGhost, a graph-based framework that models internal token interactions and neuron activations in LLMs as graphs. By aggregating token dependencies traced across layers, GraphGhost captures global information flow underlying model predictions. We formalize GraphGhost from two complementary perspectives: a sample view, which traces token dependencies for individual predictions, and a dataset view, which aggregates recurring structural patterns learned during training. Through graph analytics and quantitative experiments, we show that graph structural properties are closely associated with influential tokens and neuron nodes, and that perturbations to structurally critical nodes lead to measurable changes in reasoning behavior. These results indicate that the structural patterns captured by GraphGhost reflect meaningful internal organization of LLM reasoning. The codes are available at software part.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient inference. A practical direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM between thinking and non-thinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls the performance loss under the user-specified tolerance. Specifically, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss and determine a threshold for switching to the non-thinking model. Theoretically, using the threshold to switch between the thinking and non-thinking modes ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.09133v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Herb.jl: A Unifying Program Synthesis Library</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09726</link><description>arXiv:2510.09726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Program synthesis -- the automatic generation of code given a specification -- is one of the most fundamental tasks in artificial intelligence (AI) and the dream of many programmers. Numerous synthesizers have been developed for program synthesis, offering different approaches to the exponentially growing program space. Although such state-of-the-art tools exist, reusing and adapting them remains tedious and time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library written in Julia, to address these issues. Since current methods share similar building blocks, we aim to break down the underlying algorithms into extendable, reusable subcomponents. To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it with just a few lines of code.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.09726v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GOLD PANNING: Iterative Bayesian Signal Anchoring for Many-Document Needle-in-Haystack Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09770</link><description>arXiv:2510.09770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced position bias in long-context needle-in-haystack problems, systematically prioritizing the location of information over its relevance. While current mitigations rely on white-box access, this is effectively impossible for many state-of-the-art models. We introduce GOLD PANNING, a black-box Bayesian framework that performs inference-time active search over long contexts by (i) reordering documents to concentrate high-belief items in highly diagnostic positions (signal anchoring) and (ii) updating beliefs over document relevance from model outputs. Unlike conventional active learning, which prioritizes uncertainty reduction, GOLD PANNING leverages anchoring -- once flagged, keep it in sight -- to preserve weak cues. We implement this using iterative assignment derived from the model's diagnosticity profile, which provably identifies a target among $N$ documents in $O(\log N)$ rounds, ensuring scalability to many-document settings.On needle-in-a-haystack retrieval and long-context QA, GOLD PANNING matches Permutation Self-Consistency's target identification with $30--65%$ fewer queries and remains effective under calibration mismatch, suggesting coarse positional ordering drives performance gains. These results demonstrate that inherent model biases need not be failures, but can be used as tools for control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.09770v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Don't Just Fine-tune the Agent, Tune the Environment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10197</link><description>arXiv:2510.10197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories. $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for automated code generation, demonstrating impressive performance on established benchmarks. Despite their prosperous development, the fundamental mechanisms underlying their robustness remain poorly understood, raising critical concerns for real-world deployment. This paper conducts a systematic empirical study to uncover the internal robustness flaws of MASs using a mutation-based methodology. By designing a testing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness flaws: semantically equivalent inputs cause drastic performance drops, with MASs failing to solve 7.9\%--83.3\% of problems they initially resolved successfully.
  Through comprehensive failure analysis, we discover a fundamental cause underlying these robustness issues: the \textit{planner-coder gap}, which accounts for 75.3\% of failures. This gap arises from information loss in the multi-stage transformation process where planning agents decompose requirements into underspecified plans, and coding agents subsequently misinterpret intricate logic during code generation. Based on this formulated information transformation process, we propose a \textit{repairing method} that mitigates information loss through multi-prompt generation and introduces a monitor agent to bridge the planner-coder gap. Evaluation shows that our repairing method effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0\%--88.9\% of identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for developing more reliable MASs for code generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.10460v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DUAL-Bench: Measuring Over-Refusal and Robustness in Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10846</link><description>arXiv:2510.10846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance between safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms, while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18 VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.10846v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PaperArena: An Evaluation Benchmark for Tool-Augmented Agentic Reasoning on Scientific Literature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10909</link><description>arXiv:2510.10909v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the large-scale scientific literature is a crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents. However, existing works are mainly restricted to tool-free tasks within single papers, largely due to the lack of a benchmark that evaluates cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in authentic research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, a benchmark to evaluate LLM-based agents on questions that require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of external tools. Given a research question, agents should formulate a reasoning plan, interact with multiple papers, and invoke appropriate tools to produce a well-grounded answer. To support standardized evaluation, we provide a platform for agent execution, offering a modular tool environment including multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and programmatic computation. Experiments reveal that even the leading LLM powering a well-established agentic workflow achieves merely 38.78% average accuracy, while on the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%. We also analyze reasoning traces and diagnose agent behavior, providing the community with insights to develop and evaluate more capable scientific agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.10909v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stronger-MAS: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Collaborative LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11062</link><description>arXiv:2510.11062v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However, applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single- and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks, AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5 percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to 7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of maximality -- a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. Within a collection of methods covering Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary search, ToSFiT exhibits both state-of-the-art sample efficiency and computational efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.13328v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Identity-GRPO: Optimizing Multi-Human Identity-preserving Video Generation via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14256</link><description>arXiv:2510.14256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.14256v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DialectGen: Benchmarking and Improving Dialect Robustness in Multimodal Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14949</link><description>arXiv:2510.14949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200 unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance by small margins (&lt; 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.14949v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM Latent Reasoning as Chain of Superposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15522</link><description>arXiv:2510.15522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent reasoning offers a computation-efficient alternative to Chain-of-Thought but often suffers from performance degradation due to distributional misalignment and ambiguous chain definitions. Ideally, latent reasoning should function as a superposition of multiple reasoning paths. To realize this, we introduce Latent-SFT, a unified framework addressing challenges at three levels: token, chain, and learning. First, we define the Latent-Vocab to constrain hidden states within the pre-trained vocab-space. Second, we construct the Latent-Chain via Induction-Supervision Masking to ensure semantic compactness and sufficiency. Third, we employ Latent-Optim with stochastic Gumbel-Softmax to guide the model toward generalizable solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that Latent-SFT consistently outperforms explicit SFT across six mathematical benchmarks (e.g., GSM8k, AIME24) while achieving a 2.7x to 5.5x reduction in reasoning length. Analysis confirms that our method effectively captures a superposition of diverse reasoning trajectories rather than merely compressing a single path.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.15522v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Open Shouldn't Mean Exempt: Open-Source Exceptionalism and Generative AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16048</link><description>arXiv:2510.16048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-source status should not shield generative artificial intelligence systems from ethical or legal accountability. Through a rigorous analysis of regulatory, legal, and policy frameworks, this Article contends that open-source GenAI must be held to the same standards as proprietary systems. While recognizing the value of openness for scientific advancement, I propose a narrowly tailored safe harbor for bona fide, non-commercial research, conditioned on strict compliance with defined criteria. This Article critically examines and refutes the core claims of open-source exceptionalism--namely, that open-source GenAI disrupts entrenched oligopolies, democratizes access, and uniquely drives innovation. The evidence shows that open-source GenAI can facilitate unlawful conduct, exacerbate environmental harms, and reinforce existing power structures. Rhetoric around "democratization" and "innovation" often serves as an unsubstantiated basis for regulatory exemptions not afforded to proprietary systems. This Article ultimately advocates for a framework that promotes responsible AI development, balancing openness with robust legal and ethical safeguards and a clear-eyed assessment of societal impacts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.16048v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] In the Mood to Exclude: Revitalizing Trespass to Chattels in the Era of GenAI Scraping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16049</link><description>arXiv:2510.16049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GenAI companies are strip-mining the web. Their scraping bots harvest content at an unprecedented scale, circumventing technical barriers to fuel billion-dollar models while creators receive nothing. Courts have enabled this exploitation by misunderstanding what property rights protect online. The prevailing view treats websites as mere repositories of intellectual property and dismisses trespass claims absent server damage. That framework grants AI companies presumptive access while ignoring the economic devastation they inflict. But the content is severable from the website itself. This paper reframes the debate: websites are personal property as integrated digital assets subject to the same exclusionary rights as physical chattels. When scrapers bypass access controls and divert traffic that sustains a website's value, they commit actionable trespass. The law need not create new protections; it need only apply existing property principles to digital space.
  Courts and litigants have struggled to police unwanted, large-scale scraping because copyright preemption often narrows available claims, leaving copyright and its fair use defense as the primary battleground. Trespass to chattels offers a superior path, grounded in the fundamental right to exclude unwanted intrusions. Reviving this tort would protect not only content creators but also the digital ecosystem. Such protection would discourage exploitative scraping, preserve incentives for content creation, help protect privacy and personal data, and safeguard autonomy and expression. Reaffirming website owners' right to exclude is essential to maintaining a fair and sustainable online environment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.16049v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TopSeg: A Multi-Scale Topological Framework for Data-Efficient Heart Sound Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17346</link><description>arXiv:2510.17346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning approaches for heart-sound (PCG) segmentation built on time-frequency features can be accurate but often rely on large expert-labeled datasets, limiting robustness and deployment. We present TopSeg, a topological representation-centric framework that encodes PCG dynamics with multi-scale topological features and decodes them using a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) with an order- and duration-constrained inference step. To evaluate data efficiency and generalization, we train exclusively on PhysioNet 2016 dataset with subject-level subsampling and perform external validation on CirCor dataset. Under matched-capacity decoders, the topological features consistently outperform spectrogram and envelope inputs, with the largest margins at low data budgets; as a full system, TopSeg surpasses representative end-to-end baselines trained on their native inputs under the same budgets while remaining competitive at full data. Ablations at 10% training confirm that all scales contribute and that combining H_0 and H_1 yields more reliable S1/S2 localization and boundary stability. These results indicate that topology-aware representations provide a strong inductive bias for data-efficient, cross-dataset PCG segmentation, supporting practical use when labeled data are limited.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17346v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating LLMs for Career Guidance: Comparative Analysis of Computing Competency Recommendations Across Ten African Countries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18902</link><description>arXiv:2510.18902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employers increasingly expect graduates to utilize large language models (LLMs) in the workplace, yet the competencies needed for computing roles across Africa remain unclear given varying national contexts. This study examined how six LLMs, namely ChatGPT 4, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude 3.5, Llama 3, and Mistral AI, describe entry-level computing career expectations across ten African countries. Using the Computing Curricula 2020 framework and drawing on Digital Colonialism Theory and Ubuntu Philosophy, content analysis of 60 LLM responses to standardized prompts reveals consistent coverage of technical competencies such as cloud computing and programming, but notable differences in non-technical competencies, particularly ethics and responsible AI use. Models vary considerably in recognizing country-specific factors, including local technology ecosystems, language requirements, and national policies averaging only 35.4% contextual awareness overall. Open-source models demonstrated stronger contextual awareness and better balance between technical and professional skills, with Llama (4.47/5) and DeepSeek (4.25/5) outperforming proprietary alternatives ChatGPT-4 (3.90/5) and Claude (3.46/5). However, Mistral's poor contextual performance (0.00/4) despite being open-source indicates that development philosophy alone does not guarantee contextual responsiveness. This first comprehensive comparison of LLM career guidance for African computing students uncovers entrenched infrastructure assumptions and Western-centric biases that create gaps between technical recommendations and local realities. The findings challenge assumptions about AI tool quality in resource-constrained settings and underscore the need for decolonial approaches to AI in education, emphasizing contextual relevance and hybrid human-AI guidance models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18902v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context-aware Fairness Evaluation and Mitigation in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18914</link><description>arXiv:2510.18914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift, amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors. However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues, enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18914v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Serverless GPU Architecture for Enterprise HR Analytics: A Production-Scale BDaaS Implementation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19689</link><description>arXiv:2510.19689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference. Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput, serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets, comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90% lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 &lt; 22 ms. Interpretability remains stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for regulated enterprise and government settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.19689v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MARS-M: When Variance Reduction Meets Matrices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21800</link><description>arXiv:2510.21800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). Recent benchmark studies of LLM pretraining optimizers have demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can substantially speed up training compared with standard optimizers that do not employ variance reduction. In this paper, we introduce MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates MARS-style variance reduction with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that MARS-M converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, improving upon the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Empirical results on language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various downstream benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in coding agents have made them capable of planning, editing, running, and testing complex code bases. Despite their growing ability in coding tasks, these systems still struggle to infer and track user intent, especially when instructions are underspecified or context-dependent. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToM-SWE, a dual-agent architecture that pairs a primary software-engineering (SWE) agent with a lightweight theory-of-mind (ToM) partner agent dedicated to modeling the user's mental state. The ToM agent infers user goals, constraints, and preferences from instructions and interaction history, maintains a \textbf{persistent memory} of the user, and provides user-related suggestions to the SWE agent. In two software engineering benchmarks (ambiguous SWE-bench and stateful SWE-bench), ToM-SWE improves task success rates and user satisfaction. Notably, on the stateful SWE benchmark, a newly introduced evaluation that provides agents with a user simulator along with previous interaction histories, ToM-SWE achieves a substantially higher task success rate of 59.7\% compared to 18.1\% for OpenHands, a state-of-the-art SWE agent. Furthermore, in a three-week study with professional developers using ToM-SWE in their daily work, participants found it useful 86\% of the time, underscoring the value of stateful user modeling for practical coding agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.21903v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emotions Where Art Thou: Understanding and Characterizing the Emotional Latent Space of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22042</link><description>arXiv:2510.22042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages. Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance, indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process emotion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.22042v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Batch Speculative Decoding Done Right</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22876</link><description>arXiv:2510.22876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative decoding must produce outputs distribution identical to standard autoregressive generation-this output equivalence is not an optimization target but the defining criterion of valid speculative decoding. We demonstrate that all existing batch speculative decoding implementations violate this fundamental requirement, producing corrupted outputs ranging from repetitive tokens to gibberish. These failures stem from the ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of draft tokens, desynchronizing position IDs, attention masks, and KV-cache state. We present the first authentic batch speculative decoding framework. We (1) formalize the synchronization invariants that valid batch speculative decoding must satisfy, (2) present EQSPEC, the first algorithm that guarantees output equivalence, and analyze its cost structure to show that alignment overhead grows superlinearly and consumes up to 40\% of computation, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which reduces this overhead through cross-batch scheduling that dynamically groups same-length sequences. On SpecBench across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B pairs, our methods achieve up to 3x throughput improvement at batch size 8 while maintaining algorithmic correctness. Our methods achieve 95\% decoding-equivalence, with residual divergence attributable to floating-point non-determinism in GPU inference, not the synchronization failures that cause near-zero equivalence of prior methods.

Abstract: Many scientific and geometric problems exhibit general linear symmetries, yet most equivariant neural networks are built for compact groups or simple vector features, limiting their reuse on matrix-valued data such as covariances, inertias, or shape tensors. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), an exactly GL(n)-equivariant architecture that natively supports matrix-valued and Lie-algebraic features. ReLNs resolve a central stability issue for reductive Lie algebras by introducing a non-degenerate adjoint (conjugation)-invariant bilinear form, enabling principled nonlinear interactions and invariant feature construction in a single architecture that transfers across subgroups without redesign. We demonstrate ReLNs on algebraic tasks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries, Lorentz-equivariant particle physics, uncertainty-aware drone state estimation via joint velocity-covariance processing, learning from 3D Gaussian-splat representations, and EMLP double-pendulum benchmark spanning multiple symmetry groups. ReLNs consistently match or outperform strong equivariant and self-supervised baselines while using substantially fewer parameters and compute, improving the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and providing a practical, reusable backbone for learning with broad linear symmetries.

We model an agent implementation as a finite control program augmented with explicit memory primitives (bounded buffers, a call stack, or read/write external memory) and a stochastic policy component (e.g., an LLM) that selects among architecturally permitted actions. Instead of equating the concrete agent with a deterministic acceptor, we treat the agent-environment closed loop as inducing a probability distribution over finite interaction traces. Given an abstraction function $\Abs$ from concrete configurations to a finite abstract state space, we obtain a probabilistic trace language and an abstract probabilistic transition model $M_{\Abs}$ suitable for probabilistic model checking.
  Imposing explicit, framework-auditable restrictions on memory access and control flow, we prove that the support of the resulting trace language is regular for bounded-memory controllers, context-free for strict call-return controllers, and recursively enumerable for controllers equipped with unbounded read/write memory. These correspondences allow the reuse of existing verification methods for finite-state and pushdown systems, and they delineate precisely when undecidability barriers arise. The probabilistic semantics leads to quantitative analyses such as: what is the probability of entering an unsafe abstract region, and how can we bound this probability in the presence of environment nondeterminism.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23487v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Key and Value Weights Are Probably All You Need: On the Necessity of the Query, Key, Value weight Triplet in Encoder-Only and Decoder-Only Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23912</link><description>arXiv:2510.23912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate whether the Query, Key, Value weight triplet can be reduced in encoder-only and decoder-only transformers. Under mild assumptions, we prove that Query weights are redundant and can be replaced with the identity matrix, reducing attention parameters by $25\%$. This also simplifies optimization: attention logits become linear rather than quadratic in learned weights. Validating on decoder-only GPT-style small models trained from scratch, we find that with adjusted attention scaling and weight decay, reduced models match baseline performance despite fewer parameters. Training remains stable at over $3\times$ lower weight decay, suggesting Query weight elimination provides implicit regularization. Our analysis has also led us to a structural expressivity boundary: in the mathematically tractable ReLU setting, skip connections push MLPs into a generically disjoint function class at fixed width. These findings motivate investigation across modalities and at scale, where the observed stability and efficiency gains may prove most consequential.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23912v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24941</link><description>arXiv:2510.24941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models can generate long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but it remains unclear whether the verbalized steps reflect the models' internal thinking. In this work, we propose a True Thinking Score (TTS) to quantify the causal contribution of each step in CoT to the model's final prediction. Our experiments show that LLMs often interleave between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to compute the final output) and decorative-thinking steps (which give the appearance of reasoning but have minimal causal influence). We reveal that only a small subset of the total reasoning steps causally drive the model's prediction: e.g., on AIME, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning steps in CoT have a TTS &gt;= 0.7 (range: 0-1) for Qwen-2.5. Furthermore, we find that LLMs can be steered to internally follow or disregard specific steps in their verbalized CoT using the identified TrueThinking direction. We highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can be decorative, while steering along the TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often verbalize reasoning steps without performing them internally, challenging the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.24941v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Analysis of Causal Effect Estimation using Outcome Invariant Data Augmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25128</link><description>arXiv:2510.25128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome. However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real data experiments to support our case.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25128v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Aristotelian ontology of instrumental goals: Structural features to be managed and not failures to be eliminated</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25471</link><description>arXiv:2510.25471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instrumental goals such as resource acquisition, power-seeking, and self-preservation are key to contemporary AI alignment research, yet the phenomenon's ontology remains under-theorised. This article develops an ontological account of instrumental goals and draws out governance-relevant distinctions for advanced AI systems. After systematising the dominant alignment literature on instrumental goals we offer an exploratory Aristotelian framework that treats advanced AI systems as complex artefacts whose ends are externally imposed through design, training and deployment. On a structural reading, Aristotle's notion of hypothetical necessity explains why, given an imposed end pursued over extended horizons in particular environments, certain enabling conditions become conditionally required, thereby yielding robust instrumental tendencies. On a contingent reading, accidental causation and chance-like intersections among training regimes, user inputs, infrastructure and deployment contexts can generate instrumental-goal-like behaviours not entailed by the imposed end-structure. This dual-aspect ontology motivates for governance and management approaches that treat instrumental goals as features of advanced AI systems to be managed rather than anomalies eliminable by technical interventions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25471v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Right for the Right Reasons: Avoiding Reasoning Shortcuts via Prototypical Neurosymbolic AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25497</link><description>arXiv:2510.25497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models. However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce Prototypical Neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks (MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective, annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25497v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Metis-SPECS: Decoupling Multimodal Learning via Self-distilled Preference-based Cold Start</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25801</link><description>arXiv:2510.25801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%. Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and raising the performance ceiling.

Abstract: In recommendation systems, scaling up feature-interaction modules (e.g., Wukong, RankMixer) or user-behavior sequence modules (e.g., LONGER) has achieved notable success. However, these efforts typically proceed on separate tracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also prevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans, a unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior sequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer to convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token sequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar sequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential tokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables precomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly reducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental results on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales efficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong baselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26104v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BOTS: A Unified Framework for Bayesian Online Task Selection in LLM Reinforcement Finetuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26374</link><description>arXiv:2510.26374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training. Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We introduce BOTS, a unified framework for Bayesian Online Task Selection in LLM reinforcement finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates explicit evidence from direct evaluations of selected tasks and implicit evidence inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks, with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and exploitation for task selection. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead. Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive performance on short clips, yet evaluating long-form generation under complex textual inputs remains a significant challenge. In response to this challenge, we present LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark for long video generation (LVG) featuring multi-scene prompts with hierarchical metadata (e.g., character settings and camera behaviors), constructed from collected real-world videos. We further propose LoCoT2V-Eval, a multi-dimensional framework covering perceptual quality, text-video alignment, temporal quality, dynamic quality, and Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD), with an emphasis on aspects such as fine-grained text-video alignment and temporal character consistency. Experiments on 13 representative LVG models reveal pronounced capability disparities across evaluation dimensions, with strong perceptual quality and background consistency but markedly weaker fine-grained text-video alignment and character consistency. These findings suggest that improving prompt faithfulness and identity preservation remains a key challenge for long-form video generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26412v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CATArena: Evaluating Evolutionary Capabilities of Code Agents via Iterative Tournaments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26852</link><description>arXiv:2510.26852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current evaluation for Large Language Model (LLM) code agents predominantly focus on generating functional code in single-turn scenarios, which fails to evaluate the agent's capability for continuous code optimization and multi-turn iterative development. To bridge this gap, we introduce CATArena, a framework designed to evaluate the evolutionary capabilities of code agents via iterative tournaments. Agents engage in multi-turn tournaments and continuously refine their code through self-reflection and peer-learning based on comprehensive execution feedback. For evaluation, we propose a dual-metric system to decouple static generation proficiency from evolutionary potential. Extensive experiments reveal that an agent's evolutionary potential is not strictly correlated with its initial proficiency. Our analysis further reveals that current agents struggle to concurrently leverage both peer-learning and self-reflection for effective performance gains. Furthermore, the results validate CATArena's high extensibility and resistance to variance tasks, establishing it as a continuous and reliable standard for assessing the evolutionary capability of LLM code agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26852v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Closing the Expression Gap in LLM Instructions via Socratic Questioning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27410</link><description>arXiv:2510.27410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the ``intention expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex, high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments, including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to varying user expertise. In conclusion, our research provides a systematic methodology and a new perspective for addressing the issue of ambiguous intentions in complex human-machine collaboration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.27410v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NegoCollab: A Common Representation Negotiation Approach for Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27647</link><description>arXiv:2510.27647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents, consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator during training to derive the common representation from the local representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual transformation of features between the local representation space and the common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To better align local representations to the common representation containing multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully distilled into the sender.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.27647v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sharpness-Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization via Probability Shaping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00066</link><description>arXiv:2511.00066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a practical route to improve large language model reasoning, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a widely used optimizer in this setting. However, RLVR training is typically performed with limited control over generalization. We revisit GRPO through a robustness-based generalization view, where the generalization loss is upper bounded by a combination of the empirical loss and a sharpness surrogate measured by the gradient norm. Building on this perspective, we propose Sharpness-Guided GRPO (GRPO-SG), a simple token-weighted variant of GRPO that downweights tokens likely to cause overly large gradients, reducing sharp updates and stabilizing optimization, thereby improving generalization. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, logic puzzles and tool-augmented question answering show consistent improvements over GRPO, along with smoother gradient-norm trajectories, supporting GRPO-SG as a simple and effective generalization-oriented upgrade to GRPO for RLVR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.00066v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Latent Domain Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00067</link><description>arXiv:2511.00067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of domain generalization (DG) is to enable models to be robust against domain shift. DG is crucial for deploying vision-language models (VLMs) in real-world applications, yet most existing methods rely on domain labels that may not be available and often ambiguous. We instead study the DG setting where models must generalize well without access to explicit domain labels. Our key idea is to represent an unseen target domain as a combination of latent domains automatically discovered from training data, enabling the model to adaptively transfer knowledge across domains. To realize this, we perform latent domain clustering on image features and fuse domain-specific text features based on the similarity between the input image and each latent domain. Experiments on four benchmarks show that this strategy yields consistent gains over VLM-based baselines and provides new insights into improving robustness under domain shift.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.00067v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reviving Stale Updates: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for Asynchronous Federated Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00655</link><description>arXiv:2511.00655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its scalability is limited by synchronization overhead. Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) alleviates this issue by allowing clients to communicate independently, thereby improving wall-clock efficiency in large-scale, hardware-heterogeneous environments. However, asynchrony introduces updates computed on outdated global models (staleness) that can destabilize optimization and hinder convergence. We propose FedRevive, an AFL framework that revives stale updates through data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD). FedRevive integrates parameter-space aggregation with a lightweight, server-side DFKD process that transfers knowledge from stale client updates to the current global model without access to data. A meta-learned generator synthesizes pseudo-samples used for multi-teacher distillation. A hybrid aggregation scheme that combines raw with DFKD updates effectively mitigates staleness while retaining AFL scalability. Experiments on various vision and text benchmarks show that FedRevive achieves faster training by up to 38.4% and higher final accuracy by up to 16.5% than asynchronous baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.00655v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Step Knowledge Interaction Analysis via Rank-2 Subspace Disentanglement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01706</link><description>arXiv:2511.01706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) describe how Large Language Models (LLMs) make decisions by drawing on external Context Knowledge (CK) and Parametric Knowledge (PK). Understanding the interaction between these sources is key to assessing NLE grounding, yet these dynamics remain underexplored. Prior work has largely focused on (1) single-step generation and (2) modelled PK-CK interaction as a binary choice within a rank-1 subspace. This approach overlooks richer interactions and how they unfold over longer generations, such as complementary or supportive knowledge. We propose a novel rank-2 projection subspace that disentangles PK and CK contributions more accurately and use it for the first multi-step analysis of knowledge interactions across longer NLE sequences. Experiments across four QA datasets and three open-weight LLMs demonstrate that while rank-1 subspaces struggle to represent diverse interactions, our rank-2 formulation captures them effectively, highlighting PK alignment for supportive interactions and CK alignment for conflicting ones. Our multi-step analysis reveals, among others, that hallucinated generations exhibit strong alignment with the PK direction, whereas context-faithful generations maintain a more balanced alignment between PK and CK.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.01706v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Continuum: Efficient and Robust Multi-Turn LLM Agent Scheduling with KV Cache Time-to-Live</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02230</link><description>arXiv:2511.02230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: KV cache management is essential for efficient LLM inference. To maximize utilization, existing inference engines evict finished requests' KV cache if new requests are waiting. This policy breaks for agentic workloads, which interleave LLM calls with tools, introducing pauses that prevent effective KV reuse across turns. Since some tool calls have much shorter durations than human response multi-turn chatbot, it would be promising to retain the KV cache in during these tools. However, there are many challenges. First, we need to consider both the potential cost of recomputation or reloading (if CPU offloading enabled) and the increasing queueing delays after eviction from GPU. Second, due to the internal variance of tool call durations, we need the method to remain robust under limited predictability of tool call durations.
  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by introducing time-to-live mechanism for KV cache retaining. For LLM request that generates a tool call, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value determined by considering both the reload cost and ordering preserve benefit of retaining KV cache. Moreover, when the TTL expires, the KV cache can be automatically evicted to free up GPU memory, providing robust performance under edge cases. When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum preserves multi-turn continuity, and reduces delay for complex agentic workflows. Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times and its improvement scales with turn number increase.

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos) and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time, especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models. Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal data.

Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However, prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and $34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$ faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.05005v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Omni-View: Unlocking How Generation Facilitates Understanding in Unified 3D Model based on Multiview images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07222</link><description>arXiv:2511.07222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents Omni-View, which extends the unified multimodal understanding and generation to 3D scenes based on multiview images, exploring the principle that "generation facilitates understanding". Consisting of understanding model, texture module, and geometry module, Omni-View jointly models scene understanding, novel view synthesis, and geometry estimation, enabling synergistic interaction between 3D scene understanding and generation tasks. By design, it leverages the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of its texture module responsible for appearance synthesis, alongside the explicit geometric constraints provided by its dedicated geometry module, thereby enriching the model's holistic understanding of 3D scenes. Trained with a two-stage strategy, Omni-View achieves a state-of-the-art score of 55.4 on the VSI-Bench benchmark, outperforming existing specialized 3D understanding models, while simultaneously delivering strong performance in both novel view synthesis and 3D scene generation.

Abstract: A persistent challenge in text classification (TC) is that enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks typically degrades performance on clean data. We argue that this challenge can be resolved by modeling the distribution of clean samples in the encoder embedding manifold. To this end, we propose the Manifold-Correcting Causal Flow (MC^2F), a two-module system that operates directly on sentence embeddings. A Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) learns the density of the clean data manifold. It identifies out-of-distribution embeddings, which are then corrected by a Geodesic Purification Solver. This solver projects adversarial points back onto the learned manifold via the shortest path, restoring a clean, semantically coherent representation. We conducted extensive evaluations on text classification (TC) across three datasets and multiple adversarial attacks. The results demonstrate that our method, MC^2F, not only establishes a new state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness but also fully preserves performance on clean data, even yielding modest gains in accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.07888v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Logical Expressiveness in Graph Neural Networks via Path-Neighbor Aggregation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07994</link><description>arXiv:2511.07994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.07994v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MACEval: A Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation Network for Large Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09139</link><description>arXiv:2511.09139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models have been presented over the past few years. However, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define new metrics to quantify performance longitudinally. MACEval employs an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode, utilizing role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 23 large models demonstrate the effectiveness of MACEval, which also lightens the evaluation process and reduces a considerable amount of overhead. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) faces a fundamental scaling fidelity dilemma: rich pocket-aware conditioning captures interaction geometry but can be costly, often scales quadratically ($O(L^2)$) or worse with protein length ($L$), while efficient sequence-only conditioning can miss key interaction structure. We propose SiDGen, a structure-informed discrete diffusion framework that resolves this trade-off through a Topological Information Bottleneck (TIB). SiDGen leverages a learned, soft assignment mechanism to compress residue-level protein representations into a compact bottleneck enabling downstream pairwise computations on the coarse grid ($O(L^2/s^2)$). This design reduces memory and computational cost without compromising generative accuracy. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 and DUD-E benchmarks while significantly reducing pairwise-tensor memory. SiDGen bridges the gap between sequence-based efficiency and pocket-aware conditioning, offering a scalable path for high-throughput structure-based discovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09529v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Pose Problems: Reasoning-Driven and Solver-Adaptive Data Synthesis for Large Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09907</link><description>arXiv:2511.09907v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data are used to bootstrap problem-design strategies in the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our proposed framework achieves a cumulative average improvement of 3.4%, demonstrating robust generalization across both language and vision-language models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09907v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating from Benign to Dynamic Adversarial: A Squid Game for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10691</link><description>arXiv:2511.10691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential data contamination issue in contemporary large language models (LLMs) benchmarks presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, they predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Squid Game}, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, including instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition in performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. We also compare prominent LLM benchmarks and \textsc{Squid Game}, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train models on different multilingual mixtures and analyze their internal mechanisms using Cross-Layer Transcoders (CLTs) and Attribution Graphs. Our results reveal multilingual shared representations: the model employs highly similar features across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers.
  Training models without English shows identical multilingual shared space structures. Decoding relies partly on a small set of high-frequency features in the final layers, which linearly encode language identity from early layers. Intervening on these features allows one language to be suppressed and another substituted. Finally, to explain non-English failures, we perform a Model-Diffing experiment: underperformance arises from dim late-layer features, weak middle-layer clusters, and tokenizer bias toward English that forces early layers to specialize in word reassembly. Finetuning strengthens these features and their links, improving token assembly and language-specific decoding, providing a mechanistic explanation for multilingual gaps.

Abstract: In this work, we propose data-integrated neural networks (DataInNet) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), offering a novel approach to leveraging data (e.g., source terms, initial conditions, and boundary conditions). The core of this work lies in the integration of data into a unified network framework. DataInNet comprises two subnetworks: a data integration neural network responsible for accommodating and fusing various types of data, and a fully connected neural network dedicated to learning the residual physical information not captured by the data integration neural network. This network architecture inherently excludes function classes that violate known physical constraints, thereby substantially narrowing the solution search space. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DataInNet delivers superior performance on challenging problems, such as the Helmholtz equation (relative \(L^2\) error: O(\(10^{-6}\))) and PDEs with high frequency solutions (relative \(L^2\) error: O(\(10^{-5}\))).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.12055v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI Kill Switch for malicious web-based LLM agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13725</link><description>arXiv:2511.13725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, web-based Large Language Model (LLM) agents autonomously perform increasingly complex tasks, thereby bringing significant convenience. However, they also amplify the risks of malicious misuse cases such as unauthorized collection of personally identifiable information (PII), generation of socially divisive content, and even automated web hacking. To address these threats, we propose an AI Kill Switch technique that can immediately halt the operation of malicious web-based LLM agents. To achieve this, we introduce AutoGuard - the key idea is generating defensive prompts that trigger the safety mechanisms of malicious LLM agents. In particular, generated defense prompts are transparently embedded into the website's DOM so that they remain invisible to human users but can be detected by the crawling process of malicious agents, triggering its internal safety mechanisms to abort malicious actions once read. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a dedicated benchmark consisting of three representative malicious scenarios. Experimental results show that AutoGuard achieves over 80% Defense Success Rate (DSR) across diverse malicious agents, including GPT-4o, Claude-4.5-Sonnet and generalizes well to advanced models like GPT-5.1, Gemini-2.5-flash, and Gemini-3-pro. Also, our approach demonstrates robust defense performance in real-world website environments without significant performance degradation for benign agents. Through this research, we demonstrate the controllability of web-based LLM agents, thereby contributing to the broader effort of AI control and safety.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.13725v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A2GC: Asymmetric Aggregation with Geometric Constraints for Locally Aggregated Descriptors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14109</link><description>arXiv:2511.14109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.14109v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Geometric-disentangelment Unlearning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17100</link><description>arXiv:2511.17100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can internalize private or harmful content, motivating unlearning that removes a forget set while preserving retaining knowledge. However, forgetting updates often cause collateral degradation on retaining knowledge, creating a persistent trade-off. Existing LLM unlearning methods are often heuristic, and other theoretical approaches rely on offline feature constructions that do not capture update-time forget-retain interaction in LLMs. To address this limitation, we aim to develop an LLM unlearning method that reduces the forget-retain trade-off with theoretical guarantees. We take a first-principles view by formalizing "no side effects" as local retain invariance under small parameter updates, and prove an equivalence under optimizer-induced geometry: the retain loss is locally invariant if and only if the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients. Based on the insight, we propose Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU), a lightweight and theoretically grounded projection that can be plug-and-play to existing gradient-based unlearning methods to mitigate forget-retain side effects. Experiments on TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP-cyber show that GU strengthens forgetting while reducing retain drift. When added to SimNPO, it achieves up to 62\% improved forgetting Extraction Strength (ES) and 31\% higher retain ES.

Abstract: Constructing photorealistic and controllable robotic arm digital assets from real observations is fundamental to robotic applications. Current approaches naively bind static 3D Gaussians according to URDF links, forcing them to follow an URDF-rigged motion passively. However, the idealized URDF-rigged motion cannot accurately model the actual motion captured in real-world observations, leading to severe rendering artifacts in 3D Gaussians. To address these challenges, we propose RoboArmGS, a novel hybrid representation that refines the URDF-rigged motion with learnable B\'ezier curves, enabling more accurate real-world motion modeling. To be more specific, we present a learnable B\'ezier Curve motion refiner that corrects per-joint residuals to address mismatches between real-world motion and URDF-rigged motion. RoboArmGS enables the learning of more accurate real-world motion while achieving a coherent binding of 3D Gaussians across arm parts. To support future research, we contribute a carefully collected dataset named RoboArm4D, which comprises several widely used robotic arms for evaluating the quality of building high-quality digital assets. We evaluate our approach on RoboArm4D, and RoboArmGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world motion modeling and rendering quality. The code and dataset will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.17961v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Helps Language Models Predict Human Beliefs: Demographics or Prior Stances?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18616</link><description>arXiv:2511.18616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beliefs shape how people reason, communicate, and behave. Rather than existing in isolation, they exhibit a rich correlational structure--some connected through logical dependencies, others through indirect associations or social processes. As usage of large language models (LLMs) becomes more ubiquitous in our society, LLMs' ability to understand and reason through human beliefs has many implications from privacy issues to personalized persuasion and the potential for stereotyping. Yet how LLMs capture this interrelated landscape of beliefs remains unclear. For instance, when predicting someone's beliefs, what information affects the prediction most--who they are (demographics), what else they believe (prior stances), or a combination of both? We address these questions using data from an online debate platform, evaluating the ability of off-the-shelf open-weight LLMs to predict individuals' stance under four conditions: no context, demographics only, prior beliefs only, and both combined. We find that both types of information improve predictions over a blind baseline, with their combination yielding the best performance in most cases. However, the relative value of each varies substantially across belief domains. These findings reveal how current LLMs leverage different types of social information when reasoning about human beliefs, highlighting both their capabilities and limitations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.18616v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SSA: Sparse Sparse Attention by Aligning Full and Sparse Attention Outputs in Feature Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20102</link><description>arXiv:2511.20102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse attention reduces the quadratic complexity of full self-attention but faces two challenges: (1) an attention gap, where applying sparse attention to full-attention-trained models causes performance degradation due to train-inference distribution mismatch, and (2) a capability gap, where models trained purely with sparse attention lack complete gradient flow, preventing them from matching full-attention performance. We propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a training framework that integrates both sparse and full attention with bidirectional attention-output alignment. We prove that the approximation error scales linearly with the attention mass dropped under sparse attention, and show that SSA's alignment objective substantially reduces this quantity compared to baselines. Experiments demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both inference modes, adapts smoothly to varying sparsity budgets, and demonstrates superior long-context capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) controllers have made impressive progress in humanoid locomotion and light-weight object manipulation. However, achieving robust and precise motion control with intense force interaction remains a significant challenge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HAFO, a dual-agent reinforcement learning framework that concurrently optimizes both a robust locomotion strategy and a precise upper-body manipulation strategy via coupled training. We employ a constrained residual action space to improve dual-agent training stability and sample efficiency. The external tension disturbances are explicitly modeled using a spring-damper system, allowing for fine-grained force control through manipulation of the virtual spring. In this process, the reinforcement learning policy autonomously generates a disturbance-rejection response by utilizing environmental feedback. The experimental results demonstrate that HAFO achieves whole-body control for humanoid robots across diverse force-interaction environments using a single dual-agent policy, delivering outstanding performance under load-bearing and thrust-disturbance conditions, while maintaining stable operation even under rope suspension state.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.20275v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust gene prioritization for Dietary Restriction via Fast-mRMR Feature Selection techniques</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21211</link><description>arXiv:2511.21211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gene prioritization (identifying genes potentially associated with a biological process) is increasingly tackled with Artificial Intelligence. However, existing methods struggle with the high dimensionality and incomplete labelling of biomedical data. This work proposes a more robust and efficient pipeline that leverages Fast-mRMR Feature Selection to retain only relevant, non-redundant features for classifiers, building simpler, more interpretable and more efficient models. Experiments in our domain of interest, prioritizing genes related to Dietary Restriction (DR), show significant improvements over existing methods and enables us to integrate heterogeneous biological feature sets for better performance, a strategy that previously degraded performance due to noise accumulation. This work focuses on DR given the availability of curated data and expert knowledge for validation, yet this pipeline would be applicable to other biological processes, proving that feature selection is critical for reliable gene prioritization in high-dimensional omics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.21211v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TALES: A Taxonomy and Analysis of Cultural Representations in LLM-generated Stories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21322</link><description>arXiv:2511.21322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how they represent diverse cultures. However, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived experience and native language proficiency from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88% of the generated stories contain misrepresentations, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. We also transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.21322v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Age Optimal Sampling and Routing under Intermittent Links and Energy Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00985</link><description>arXiv:2512.00985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Links in practical systems, such as satellite--terrestrial integrated networks, exhibit distinct delay distributions, intermittent availability, and heterogeneous energy costs. These characteristics pose significant challenges to maintaining timely and energy-efficient status updates. While link availability restricts feasible transmission routes, routing decisions determine the actual delay and energy expenditure. This paper tackles these challenges by jointly optimizing sampling and routing decisions to minimize monotonic, non-linear Age of Information (AoI). The proposed formulation incorporates key system features, including multiple routes with correlated random delays, stochastic link availability, and route-dependent energy consumption. We model the problem as an infinite-horizon Constrained Semi-Markov Decision Process (CSMDP) with a hybrid state--action space and develop an efficient nested algorithm, termed Bisec-\textsc{ReaVI}, to solve this problem. We analyze the structural properties of the solution and reveal a well-defined jointly optimal policy structure: (i) For general monotonic penalty functions, the optimal sampling policy is a piecewise linear waiting policy with at most $N$ breakpoints given $N$ routes; and (ii) under a derived Expected Penalty Ordering condition, the optimal routing policy is a monotonic threshold-based handover policy characterized by at most $\binom{N}{2}$ thresholds. Numerical experiments in a \textit{satellite--terrestrial} integrated routing scenario demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently balances energy usage and information freshness, and reveal a counter-intuitive insight: \textit{even routes with higher average delay, higher delay variance or lower availability can still play a critical role in minimizing monotonic functions of AoI}.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.00985v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Retrieval: A Modular Benchmark for Academic Deep Research Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00986</link><description>arXiv:2512.00986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A surge in academic publications calls for automated deep research (DR) systems, but accurately evaluating them is still an open problem. First, existing benchmarks often focus narrowly on retrieval while neglecting high-level planning and reasoning. Second, existing benchmarks favor general domains over the academic domains that are the core application for DR agents. To address these gaps, we introduce ADRA-Bank, a modular benchmark for Academic DR Agents. Grounded in academic literature, our benchmark is a human-annotated dataset of 200 instances across 10 academic domains, including both research and review papers. Furthermore, we propose a modular Evaluation Paradigm for Academic DR Agents (ADRA-Eval), which leverages the rich structure of academic papers to assess the core capabilities of planning, retrieval, and reasoning. It employs two complementary modes: an end-to-end evaluation for \task agents and an isolated evaluation for foundational LLMs as potential backbones. Results reveal uneven capabilities: while agents show specialized strengths, they struggle with multi-source retrieval and cross-field consistency. Moreover, improving high-level planning capability is the crucial factor for unlocking the reasoning potential of foundational LLMs as backbones.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) highlight the need for benchmarks that rigorously evaluate structured chart comprehension. Chart grounding refers to the bidirectional alignment between a chart's visual appearance and its structured semantics. This task requires models to produce a symbolic specification that faithfully captures the chart's visual and structural intent, while also recovering the underlying tabular data with precise values and relationships. Chart grounding directly reflects a model's capabilities in numerical reasoning, multimodal alignment, and structural reconstruction, and has several important real-world applications. Existing benchmarks, constrained by narrow chart diversity, isolated tasks, and incomplete evaluation frameworks, fail to holistically assess grounding. To address this, we propose ChartAnchor, a comprehensive benchmark of 8k+ chart-table-code triples spanning 30 chart types drawn from diverse real-world and augmented sources. ChartAnchor introduces two complementary tasks: chart-to-code generation and controlled chart-to-table reconstruction, enabling cross-validation of visual and numerical fidelity. A multi-level evaluation framework integrates semantic validation, stylistic analysis, and perceptual metrics to assess both structural and content-level correctness. Extensive experiments on MLLMs reveal critical limitations in numerical precision and code synthesis, emphasizing the need for structured reasoning beyond surface-level perception. By unifying symbolic and data-driven grounding, ChartAnchor establishes a rigorous foundation for chart grounding, offering meaningful insights for advancing MLLMs in scientific, financial, and industrial domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.01017v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structured Spectral Reasoning for Frequency-Adaptive Multimodal Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01372</link><description>arXiv:2512.01372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation aims to integrate collaborative signals with heterogeneous content such as visual and textual information, but remains challenged by modality-specific noise, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation over user-item graphs. These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.01372v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Mean-Field Dynamics of Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01868</link><description>arXiv:2512.01868v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.01868v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Belobog: Move Language Fuzzing Framework For Real-World Smart Contracts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02918</link><description>arXiv:2512.02918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Move is a research-oriented programming language designed for secure and verifiable smart contract development and has been widely used in managing billions of digital assets in blockchains, such as Sui and Aptos. Move features a strong static type system and explicit resource semantics to enforce safety properties such as the prevention of data races, invalid asset transfers, and entry vulnerabilities. However, smart contracts written in Move may still contain certain vulnerabilities that are beyond the reach of its type system. It is thus essential to validate Move smart contracts. Unfortunately, due to its strong type system, existing smart contract fuzzers are ineffective in producing syntactically or semantically valid transactions to test Move smart contracts. This paper introduces the first fuzzing framework, Belobog, for Move smart contracts. Belobog is type-aware and ensures that all generated and mutated transactions are well-typed. More specifically, for a target Move smart contract, Belobog first constructs a type graph based on Move's type system, and then generates or mutates a transaction based on the graph trace derived from the type graph. In order to overcome the complex checks in Move smart contracts, we further design and implement a concolic executor in Belobog. We evaluated Belobog on 109 real-world Move smart contract projects. The experimental results show that Belobog is able to detect 100% critical and 79% major vulnerabilities manually audited by human experts. We further selected two recent notorious incidents in the Move ecosystem, i.e., Cetus and Nemo. Belobog successfully reproduced full exploits for both of them, without any prior knowledge. Moreover, we applied Belobog on three ongoing auditing projects and found 2 critical, 2 major, and 3 medium new vulnerabilities, all acknowledged by the project developers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.02918v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tuning-Free Structured Sparse Recovery of Multiple Measurement Vectors using Implicit Regularization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03393</link><description>arXiv:2512.03393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering jointly sparse signals in the multiple measurement vectors (MMV) setting is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but traditional methods often require careful parameter tuning or prior knowledge of the sparsity of the signal and/or noise variance. We propose a tuning-free framework that leverages implicit regularization (IR) from overparameterization to overcome this limitation. Our approach reparameterizes the estimation matrix into factors that decouple the shared row-support from individual vector entries and applies gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective. We prove that with a sufficiently small and balanced initialization, the optimization dynamics exhibit a "momentum-like" effect where the true support grows significantly faster. Leveraging a Lyapunov-based analysis of the gradient flow, we further establish formal guarantees that the solution trajectory converges towards an idealized row-sparse solution. Empirical results demonstrate that our tuning-free approach achieves performance comparable to optimally tuned established methods. Furthermore, our framework significantly outperforms these baselines in scenarios where accurate priors are unavailable to the baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.03393v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Automated Framework for Large-Scale Graph-Based Cerebrovascular Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03869</link><description>arXiv:2512.03869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present CaravelMetrics, a computational framework for automated cerebrovascular analysis that models vessel morphology through skeletonization-derived graph representations. The framework integrates atlas-based regional parcellation, centerline extraction, and graph construction to compute fifteen morphometric, topological, fractal, and geometric features. The features can be estimated globally from the complete vascular network or regionally within arterial territories, enabling multiscale characterization of cerebrovascular organization. Applied to 570 3D TOF-MRA scans from the IXI dataset (ages 20-86), CaravelMetrics yields reproducible vessel graphs capturing age- and sex-related variations and education-associated increases in vascular complexity, consistent with findings reported in the literature. The framework provides a scalable and fully automated approach for quantitative cerebrovascular feature extraction, supporting normative modeling and population-level studies of vascular health and aging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.03869v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EtCon: Edit-then-Consolidate for Reliable Knowledge Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04753</link><description>arXiv:2512.04753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to update specific facts in large language models (LLMs) without full retraining. Prior efforts sought to tune the knowledge layers of LLMs, achieving improved performance in controlled, teacher-forced evaluations. However, they still encounter challenges in real-world autoregressive generation scenarios, which greatly limit their practical applicability. Our empirical analysis reveals two issues: (1) Most methods degrade pre-trained capabilities after injecting new knowledge; (2) They may exhibit a discrepancy between stored parametric knowledge and inference-time autoregressive generation behavior. To this end, we propose EtCon, an edit-then-consolidate paradigm that couples targeted edits with post-edit consolidation. Specifically, our framework comprises two stages: (1) Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT) performs a constrained targeted edit to update parametric knowledge while controlling policy drift. (2) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) consolidates the edit by aligning autoregressive trajectories with the intended fact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EtCon improves editing reliability and real-world generalization, while better preserving pre-trained capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.04753v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Blueprints of Intelligence: A Functional-Topological Foundation for Perception and Representation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05089</link><description>arXiv:2512.05089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world phenomena do not generate arbitrary variability: their signals concentrate on compact, low-variability subsets of functional space, enabling rapid generalization from few examples. A small child can recognize a dog after extremely limited exposure because the perceptual manifold of "dog" is compact, structured, and low-dimensional. We formalize this principle through a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations produced by a physical process forms a compact subset of a Banach space, endowed with stable invariants, a finite Hausdorff radius, and an induced continuous perceptual functional.
  This geometry provides explicit limits on knowledge, conditions for identifiability, and guarantees for generalization from sparse evidence -- properties fundamental to both natural and artificial intelligence. Across electromechanical, electrochemical, and physiological domains, we show that real-world processes consistently generate compact perceptual manifolds with the same geometric characteristics. Their boundaries can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner as the empirical radius saturates with increasing sampling, even when the governing equations are unknown.
  These results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction. It provides a geometric explanation for why biological learners and self-supervised AI systems can generalize from few observations, and establishes compact perceptual manifolds as a fundamental building block for future AI architectures. Finally, this work unifies biological perception and modern self-supervised models under a single geometric principle: both derive their generalization ability from the compactness and invariants of real-world perceptual manifolds.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05089v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SHAP-Guided Kernel Actor-Critic for Explainable Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05291</link><description>arXiv:2512.05291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Actor-critic (AC) methods are a cornerstone of reinforcement learning (RL) but offer limited interpretability. Current explainable RL methods seldom use state attributions to assist training. Rather, they treat all state features equally, thereby neglecting the heterogeneous impacts of individual state dimensions on the reward. We propose RKHS-SHAP-based Advanced Actor-Critic (RSA2C), an attribution-aware, kernelized, two-timescale AC algorithm, including Actor, Value Critic, and Advantage Critic. The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs. These RKHS-enhanced components use sparsified dictionaries: the Value Critic maintains its own dictionary, while the Actor and Advantage Critic share one. State attributions, computed from the Value Critic via RKHS-SHAP (kernel mean embedding for on-manifold and conditional mean embedding for off-manifold expectations), are converted into Mahalanobis-gated weights that modulate Actor gradients and Advantage Critic targets. We derive a global, non-asymptotic convergence bound under state perturbations, showing stability through the perturbation-error term and efficiency through the convergence-error term. Empirical results on three continuous-control environments show that RSA2C achieves efficiency, stability, and interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05291v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VAT: Vision Action Transformer by Unlocking Full Representation of ViT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06013</link><description>arXiv:2512.06013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In robot learning, Vision Transformers (ViTs) are standard for visual perception, yet most methods discard valuable information by using only the final layer's features. We argue this provides an insufficient representation and propose the Vision Action Transformer (VAT), a novel architecture that is extended from ViT and unlocks the full feature hierarchy of ViT. VAT processes specialized action tokens with visual features across all transformer layers, enabling a deep and progressive fusion of perception and action generation. On a suite of simulated manipulation tasks, VAT achieves a 98.15\% average success rate across four LIBERO benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art by outperforming prior methods like OpenVLA-OFT. Our work presents not only a powerful model for imitation learning but also demonstrates the critical importance of leveraging the complete ''representation trajectory'' of vision models to advance robotic policy.

Abstract: Determining whether a provided context contains sufficient information to answer a question is a critical challenge for building reliable question-answering systems. While simple prompting strategies have shown success on factual questions, they frequently fail on inferential ones that require reasoning beyond direct text extraction. We hypothesize that asking a model to first reason about what specific information is missing provides a more reliable, implicit signal for assessing overall sufficiency. To this end, we propose a structured Identify-then-Verify framework for robust sufficiency modeling. Our method first generates multiple hypotheses about missing information and establishes a semantic consensus. It then performs a critical verification step, forcing the model to re-examine the source text to confirm whether this information is truly absent. We evaluate our method against established baselines across diverse multi-hop and factual QA datasets. The results demonstrate that by guiding the model to justify its claims about missing information, our framework produces more accurate sufficiency judgments while clearly articulating any information gaps.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.06476v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AlignGemini: Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection Through Task-Model Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06746</link><description>arXiv:2512.06746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used for detecting AI-generated images (AIGI). However, converting VLMs into reliable detectors is resource-intensive, and the resulting models often suffer from hallucination and poor generalization. To investigate the root cause, we conduct an empirical analysis and identify two consistent behaviors. First, fine-tuning VLMs with semantic supervision improves semantic discrimination and generalizes well to unseen data. Second, fine-tuning VLMs with pixel-artifact supervision leads to weak generalization. These findings reveal a fundamental task-model misalignment. VLMs are optimized for high-level semantic reasoning and lack inductive bias toward low-level pixel artifacts. In contrast, conventional vision models effectively capture pixel-level artifacts but are less sensitive to semantic inconsistencies. This indicates that different models are naturally suited to different subtasks. Based on this insight, we formulate AIGI detection as two orthogonal subtasks: semantic consistency checking and pixel-artifact detection. Neglecting either subtask leads to systematic detection failures. We further propose the Task-Model Alignment principle and instantiate it in a two-branch detector, AlignGemini. The detector combines a VLM trained with pure semantic supervision and a vision model trained with pure pixel-artifact supervision. By enforcing clear specialization, each branch captures complementary cues. Experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks show that AlignGemini improves average accuracy by 9.5 percent using simplified training data. These results demonstrate that task-model alignment is an effective principle for generalizable AIGI detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.06746v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Next-Token to Next-Block: A Principled Adaptation Path for Diffusion LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06776</link><description>arXiv:2512.06776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) enable fast generation, yet training large DLMs from scratch is costly. As a practical shortcut, adapting off-the-shelf Auto-Regressive (AR) model weights into a DLM could quickly equip the DLM with strong long-context generation capabilies. Prior "adaptation" attempts either modify logits or randomly grow attention masks to Full-Sequence diffusion, or simply transplant AR weights into a Block-Diffusion recipe, leaving two key questions unaddressed: where is the final destination of adaptation, and how to adapt better? For manifold benefits, we reframe the whole AR-to-DLM adaptation under the Block-Diffusion paradigm, transitioning from block size 1 to the final Block-Diffusion state. Concretely, the principled pathway of adaptation is designed as follows: we keep a context-causal path where causal attention is kept in the prefix, an efficient parallel adaptation procedure where an AR guidance is maintained, and gradual increment of the generation block size for a smoother transition. Built on these components, the adaptation is proved competitive on various models at different scales. With better adaptation, we propose NBDiff-7B that could inherit the long-context modeling and reasoning capabilities, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among the 7B-class DLMs. Codes: https://github.com/YuchuanTian/NBDiff.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.06776v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Function-Correcting Codes for Insertion-Deletion Channel</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07243</link><description>arXiv:2512.07243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In coding theory, handling errors that occur when symbols are inserted or deleted from a transmitted message is a long-standing challenge. Optimising redundancy for insertion and deletion channels remains a key open problem with significant importance for applications in DNA data storage and document exchange. Recently, a coding framework known as function-correcting codes has been proposed to address the challenge of minimising redundancy while preserving specific functions of the message. This framework has gained attention due to its potential applications in machine learning systems and long-term archival data storage. Motivated by the problem of redundancy optimisation for insertion and deletion channels, we propose a new framework called function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In this paper, we introduce the notions of function-correcting insertion codes, function-correcting deletion codes, and function-correcting insdel codes, and we show that these three formulations are equivalent. We then define insdel distance matrices and irregular insdel-distance codes, and derive lower and upper bounds on the optimal redundancy achievable by function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In addition, we establish Gilbert-Varshamov and Plotkin-like bounds on the length of irregular insdel-distance codes. Using the relation between optimal redundancy and the length of such codes, we obtain a simplified lower bound on optimal redundancy. Finally, we derive bounds on the optimal redundancy of function-correcting insdel codes for several classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, VT syndrome functions, the number-of-runs function, and the maximum-run-length function.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.07243v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Experience-Evolving Multi-Turn Tool-Use Agent with Hybrid Episodic-Procedural Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07287</link><description>arXiv:2512.07287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As intents unfold and environments change, multi-turn agents face continuously shifting decision contexts. Although reusing past experience is intuitively appealing, existing approaches remain limited: full trajectories are often too context-specific to transfer, while tool-level reuse ignores the surrounding context and environment. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid episodic-procedural memory strategy (H-EPM) that enables experience-induced self-evolution of multi-turn tool-use policies by adaptively reusing partially overlapping successful experiences during both inference and training. Inspired by human episodic-procedural integration, we construct a tool graph from accumulated trajectories, where recurring tool-to-tool dependencies capture procedural routines and each edge is augmented with compact episodic summaries of relevant context. At inference time, the agent dynamically balances episodic recall for contextual reasoning with procedural execution for routine steps. Beyond inference, H-EPM introduces a memory-guided reinforcement learning paradigm that directly addresses a core challenge in multi-turn agent reinforcement learning, namely ineffective exploration over long trajectories. By biasing exploration toward historically successful tool transitions, H-EPM learns a stronger policy that generalizes at inference time without relying on domain-specific experience collection. Experiments show that H-EPM consistently delivers substantial inference-time gains over strong baselines across multi-turn tool-use benchmarks, reaching improvements of up to fifty percent. It also improves reinforcement learning policy performance, achieving gains of up to forty percent on out-of-distribution tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.07287v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalizations of the Normalized Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform for Limited Data Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08099</link><description>arXiv:2512.08099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT) exploits one-dimensional Wasserstein transport and the Radon transform to represent prominent features in images. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and facilitates classification tasks, especially in the small data regime, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology. Here, a typical issue is that the given data may be subject to affine transformations caused by the measuring process. To make the R-CDT invariant under arbitrary affine transformations, a two-step normalization of the R-CDT has been proposed in our earlier works. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a family of generalized normalizations to enhance flexibility for applications. Second, we study multi-dimensional and non-Euclidean settings by making use of generalized Radon transforms. We prove that our novel feature representations are invariant under certain transformations and allow for linear separation in feature space. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments based on 2d images, 3d shapes and 3d rotation matrices, showing near perfect classification accuracies and clustering results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.08099v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Model-Based Diffusion Sampling for Predictive Control in Offline Decision Making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08280</link><description>arXiv:2512.08280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline decision-making via diffusion models often produces trajectories that are misaligned with system dynamics, limiting their reliability for control. We propose Model Predictive Diffuser (MPDiffuser), a compositional diffusion framework that combines a diffusion planner with a dynamics diffusion model to generate task-aligned and dynamically plausible trajectories. MPDiffuser interleaves planner and dynamics updates during sampling, progressively correcting feasibility while preserving task intent. A lightweight ranking module then selects trajectories that best satisfy task objectives. The compositional design improves sample efficiency and adaptability by enabling the dynamics model to leverage diverse and previously unseen data independently of the planner. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent improvements over prior diffusion-based methods on unconstrained (D4RL) and constrained (DSRL) benchmarks, and validate practicality through deployment on a real quadrupedal robot.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.08280v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CloudFix: Automated Policy Repair for Cloud Access Control Policies Using Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09957</link><description>arXiv:2512.09957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Access control policies are vital for securing modern cloud computing, where organizations must manage access to sensitive data across thousands of users in distributed system settings. Cloud administrators typically write and update policies manually, which can be an error-prone and time-consuming process and can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Existing approaches based on symbolic analysis have demonstrated success in automated debugging and repairing access control policies; however, their generalizability is limited in the context of cloud-based access control. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been utilized for automated program repair; however, their applicability to repairing cloud access control policies remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CloudFix, the first automated policy repair framework for cloud access control that combines formal methods with LLMs. Given an access control policy and a specification of allowed and denied access requests, CloudFix employs Formal Methods-based Fault Localization to identify faulty statements in the policy and leverages LLMs to generate potential repairs, which are then verified using SMT solvers. To evaluate CloudFix, we curated a dataset of 282 real-world AWS access control policies extracted from forum posts and augmented them with synthetically generated request sets based on real scenarios. Our experimental results show that CloudFix improves repair accuracy over a Baseline implementation across varying request sizes. Our work is the first to leverage LLMs for policy repair, showcasing the effectiveness of LLMs for access control and enabling efficient and automated repair of cloud access control policies. We make our tool Cloudfix and AWS dataset publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.09957v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Geometric Dynamics of Agentic Loops in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10350</link><description>arXiv:2512.10350v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iterative LLM systems(self-refinement, chain-of-thought, autonomous agents) are increasingly deployed, yet their temporal dynamics remain uncharacterized. Prior work evaluates task performance at convergence but ignores the trajectory: how does semantic content evolve across iterations? Does it stabilize, drift, or oscillate? Without answering these questions, we cannot predict system behavior, guarantee stability, or systematically design iterative architectures.
  We formalize agentic loops as discrete dynamical systems in semantic space. Borrowing from dynamical systems theory, we define trajectories, attractors and dynamical regimes for recursive LLM transformations, providing rigorous geometric definitions adapted to this setting. Our framework reveals that agentic loops exhibit classifiable dynamics: contractive (convergence toward stable semantic attractors), oscillatory (cycling among attractors), or exploratory (unbounded divergence).
  Experiments on singular loops validate the framework. Iterative paraphrasing produces contractive dynamics with measurable attractor formation and decreasing dispersion. Iterative negation produces exploratory dynamics with no stable structure. Crucially, prompt design directly controls the dynamical regime - the same model exhibits fundamentally different geometric behaviors depending solely on the transformation applied.

However, safety alignment under Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from forgetting learned general abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax. In addition, we theoretically prove that NSPO preserves the model's original core capabilities, while still guaranteeing a descent direction for effective safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSPO outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance without sacrificing accuracy on general tasks, including math, code, and instruction-following tasks. Notably, NSPO is data-efficient and only requires 40% of public human-annotated safety data from PKU-SafeRLHF to achieve promising safety performance, without a large amount of mixed general tasks data in existing alignment methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11391v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bounding Hallucinations: Information-Theoretic Guarantees for RAG Systems via Merlin-Arthur Protocols</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11614</link><description>arXiv:2512.11614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) relies on retrieved context to guide large language models (LLM), yet treats retrieval as a weak heuristic rather than verifiable evidence -- leading to unsupported answers, hallucinations, and reliance on spurious context. We introduce a novel training framework that treats the RAG pipeline as an interactive proof system by adapting the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol: Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions with unknown context provenance and Merlin gives helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use an XAI method to identify and modify evidence most influential to Arthur. This trains Arthur to (1) answer when evidence supports the answer, (2) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (3) rely on the context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a verification framework that disentangles explanation fidelity from model predictive errors, and introduce the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A mutual-information guarantees. Across three RAG datasets and multiple LLM families and sizes, M/A training makes LLMs more grounded in evidence, increases information theoretic measures (soundness, completeness) and reject behavior with less hallucinations, without manually annotated unanswerable samples. Finally, the retriever also improves recall and MRR via automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. While high accuracy does not guarantee entropy flow from context to answer, our EIF results show that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision enables RAG systems that treat retrieved documents as verifiable evidence. % rather than suggestions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11614v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Video Deepfake Abuse: How Company Choices Predictably Shape Misuse Patterns</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11815</link><description>arXiv:2512.11815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2022, AI image generators crossed a key threshold, enabling much more efficient and dynamic production of photorealistic deepfake images than before. This enabled opportunities for creative and positive uses of these models. However, it also enabled unprecedented opportunities for the low-effort creation of AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (AIG-NCII), including AI-generated child sexual abuse material (AIG-CSAM). Empirically, these harms were principally enabled by a small number of models that were trained on web data with pornographic content, released with open weights, and insufficiently safeguarded. In this paper, we observe ways in which the same patterns are emerging with video generation models in 2025. Specifically, we analyze how a small number of open-weight AI video generation models have become the dominant tools for videorealistic AIG-NCII video generation. We then analyze the literature on model safeguards and conclude that (1) developers who openly release the weights of capable video generation models without appropriate data curation and/or post-training safeguards foreseeably contribute to mitigatable downstream harm, and (2) model distribution platforms that do not proactively moderate individual misuse or models designed for AIG-NCII foreseeably amplify this harm. While there are no perfect defenses against AIG-NCII and AIG-CSAM from open-weight AI models, we argue that risk management by model developers and distributors, informed by emerging safeguard techniques, will substantially affect the future ease of creating AIG-NCII and AIG-CSAM with generative AI video tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11815v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReGlove: A Soft Pneumatic Glove for Activities of Daily Living Assistance via Wrist-Mounted Vision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11824</link><description>arXiv:2512.11824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents ReGlove, a system that converts low-cost commercial pneumatic rehabilitation gloves into vision-guided assistive orthoses. Chronic upper-limb impairment affects millions worldwide, yet existing assistive technologies remain prohibitively expensive or rely on unreliable biological signals. Our platform integrates a wrist-mounted camera with an edge-computing inference engine (Raspberry Pi 5) to enable context-aware grasping without requiring reliable muscle signals. By adapting real-time YOLO-based computer vision models, the system achieves 96.73% grasp classification accuracy with sub-40.00 millisecond end-to-end latency. Physical validation using standardized benchmarks shows 82.71% success on YCB object manipulation and reliable performance across 27 Activities of Daily Living (ADL) tasks. With a total cost under $250 and exclusively commercial components, ReGlove provides a technical foundation for accessible, vision-based upper-limb assistance that could benefit populations excluded from traditional EMG-controlled devices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11824v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Tokens to Photons: Test-Time Physical Prompting for Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12571</link><description>arXiv:2512.12571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To extend the application of vision-language models (VLMs) from web images to sensor-mediated physical environments, we propose Multi-View Physical-prompt for Test-Time Adaptation (MVP), a forward-only framework that moves test-time adaptation (TTA) from tokens to photons by treating the camera exposure triangle--ISO, shutter speed, and aperture--as physical prompts. At inference, MVP acquires a library of physical views per scene, selects the top-k sensor settings using a source-affinity score, evaluates each retained view under lightweight digital augmentations, filters the lowest-entropy subset of augmented views, and aggregates predictions with Zero-temperature softmax (i.e., hard voting). This selection-then-vote design is simple, calibration-friendly, and requires no gradients or model modifications. On ImageNet-ES and ImageNet-ES-Diverse, MVP consistently outperforms digital-only TTA on single Auto-Exposure captures, by up to 25.6 percentage points (pp), and delivers up to 3.4 pp additional gains over pipelines that combine conventional sensor control with TTA. MVP remains effective under reduced parameter candidate sets that lower capture latency, demonstrating practicality. These results support the main claim that, beyond post-capture prompting, measurement-time control--selecting and combining real physical views--substantially improves robustness for VLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.12571v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dual-Phase Federated Deep Unlearning via Weight-Aware Rollback and Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13381</link><description>arXiv:2512.13381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FUL) focuses on client data and computing power to offer a privacy-preserving solution. However, high computational demands, complex incentive mechanisms, and disparities in client-side computing power often lead to long times and higher costs. To address these challenges, many existing methods rely on server-side knowledge distillation that solely removes the updates of the target client, overlooking the privacy embedded in the contributions of other clients, which can lead to privacy leakage. In this work, we introduce DPUL, a novel server-side unlearning method that deeply unlearns all influential weights to prevent privacy pitfalls. Our approach comprises three components: (i) identifying high-weight parameters by filtering client update magnitudes, and rolling them back to ensure deep removal. (ii) leveraging the variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and eliminate low-weight parameters. (iii) utilizing a projection-based technique to recover the model. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that DPUL surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, providing a 1%-5% improvement in accuracy and up to 12x reduction in time cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.13381v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Random-Bridges as Stochastic Transports for Generative Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14190</link><description>arXiv:2512.14190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper motivates the use of random-bridges -- stochastic processes conditioned to take target distributions at fixed timepoints -- in the realm of generative modelling. Herein, random-bridges can act as stochastic transports between two probability distributions when appropriately initialized, and can display either Markovian or non-Markovian, and either continuous, discontinuous or hybrid patterns depending on the driving process. We show how one can start from general probabilistic statements and then branch out into specific representations for learning and simulation algorithms in terms of information processing. Our empirical results, built on Gaussian random bridges, produce high-quality samples in significantly fewer steps compared to traditional approaches, while achieving competitive Frechet inception distance scores. Our analysis provides evidence that the proposed framework is computationally cheap and suitable for high-speed generation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.14190v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uni-Parser Technical Report</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15098</link><description>arXiv:2512.15098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This technical report introduces Uni-Parser, an industrial-grade document parsing engine tailored for scientific literature and patents, delivering high throughput, robust accuracy, and cost efficiency. Unlike pipeline-based document parsing methods, Uni-Parser employs a modular, loosely coupled multi-expert architecture that preserves fine-grained cross-modal alignments across text, equations, tables, figures, and chemical structures, while remaining easily extensible to emerging modalities. The system incorporates adaptive GPU load balancing, distributed inference, dynamic module orchestration, and configurable modes that support either holistic or modality-specific parsing. Optimized for large-scale cloud deployment, Uni-Parser achieves a processing rate of up to 20 PDF pages per second on 8 x NVIDIA RTX 4090D GPUs, enabling cost-efficient inference across billions of pages. This level of scalability facilitates a broad spectrum of downstream applications, ranging from literature retrieval and summarization to the extraction of chemical structures, reaction schemes, and bioactivity data, as well as the curation of large-scale corpora for training next-generation large language models and AI4Science models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.15098v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] In-Context Semi-Supervised Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15934</link><description>arXiv:2512.15934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in understanding the capacity of Transformers for in-context learning (ICL), yet most theory focuses on supervised settings with explicitly labeled pairs. In practice, Transformers often perform well even when labels are sparse or absent, suggesting crucial structure within unlabeled contextual demonstrations. We introduce and study in-context semi-supervised learning (IC-SSL), where a small set of labeled examples is accompanied by many unlabeled points, and show that Transformers can leverage the unlabeled context to learn a robust, context-dependent representation. This representation enables accurate predictions and markedly improves performance in low-label regimes, offering foundational insights into how Transformers exploit unlabeled context for representation learning within the ICL framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.15934v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT): A battery life prediction foundation model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16334</link><description>arXiv:2512.16334v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early prediction of battery cycle life is essential for accelerating battery research, manufacturing, and deployment. Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing 995 batteries and 537 aging conditions of LIBs, sodium-ion batteries and Zinc-ion batteries. This work establishes a foundation model pathway for battery lifetime prediction, paving the way toward universal battery lifetime prediction systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16334v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smoothing DiLoCo with Primal Averaging for Faster Training of LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17131</link><description>arXiv:2512.17131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Generalized Primal Averaging (GPA), an extension of Nesterov's method that unifies and generalizes recent averaging-based optimizers like single-worker DiLoCo and Schedule-Free, within a non-distributed setting. While DiLoCo relies on a memory-intensive two-loop structure to periodically aggregate pseudo-gradients using Nesterov momentum, GPA eliminates this complexity by decoupling Nesterov's interpolation constants to enable smooth iterate averaging at every step. Structurally, GPA resembles Schedule-Free but replaces uniform averaging with exponential moving averaging. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo and AdamW with reduced memory overhead. GPA achieves speedups of 8.71%, 10.13%, and 9.58% over the AdamW baseline in terms of steps to reach target validation loss for Llama-160M, 1B, and 8B models, respectively. Similarly, on the ImageNet ViT workload, GPA achieves speedups of 7% and 25.5% in the small and large batch settings respectively. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA matches or exceeds the original convergence guarantees depending on the interpolation constants.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.17131v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Joint Learning of Depth, Pose, and Local Radiance Field for Large Scale Monocular 3D Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18237</link><description>arXiv:2512.18237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photorealistic 3-D reconstruction from monocular video collapses in large-scale scenes when depth, pose, and radiance are solved in isolation: scale-ambiguous depth yields ghost geometry, long-horizon pose drift corrupts alignment, and a single global NeRF cannot model hundreds of metres of content. We introduce a joint learning framework that couples all three factors and demonstrably overcomes each failure case. Our system begins with a Vision-Transformer (ViT) depth network trained with metric-scale supervision, giving globally consistent depths despite wide field-of-view variations. A multi-scale feature bundle-adjustment (BA) layer refines camera poses directly in feature space--leveraging learned pyramidal descriptors instead of brittle keypoints--to suppress drift on unconstrained trajectories. For scene representation, we deploy an incremental local-radiance-field hierarchy: new hash-grid NeRFs are allocated and frozen on-the-fly when view overlap falls below a threshold, enabling city-block-scale coverage on a single GPU. Evaluated on the Tanks and Temples benchmark, our method reduces Absolute Trajectory Error to 0.001-0.021 m across eight indoor-outdoor sequences--up to 18x lower than BARF and 2x lower than NoPe-NeRF--while maintaining sub-pixel Relative Pose Error. These results demonstrate that metric-scale, drift-free 3-D reconstruction and high-fidelity novel-view synthesis are achievable from a single uncalibrated RGB camera.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18237v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Helios: A Foundational Language Model for Smart Energy Knowledge Reasoning and Application</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19299</link><description>arXiv:2512.19299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the global drive toward carbon neutrality, deeply coordinated smart energy systems underpin industrial transformation. However, the interdisciplinary, fragmented, and fast-evolving expertise in this domain prevents general-purpose LLMs, which lack domain knowledge and physical-constraint awareness, from delivering precise engineering-aligned inference and generation. To address these challenges, we introduce Helios, a large language model tailored to the smart energy domain, together with a comprehensive suite of resources to advance LLM research in this field. Specifically, we develop Enersys, a multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end dataset construction, through which we produce: (1) a smart energy knowledge base, EnerBase, to enrich the model's foundational expertise; (2) an instruction fine-tuning dataset, EnerInstruct, to strengthen performance on domain-specific downstream tasks; and (3) an RLHF dataset, EnerReinforce, to align the model with human preferences and industry standards. Leveraging these resources, Helios undergoes large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF. We also release EnerBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in smart energy scenarios, and demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances domain knowledge mastery, task execution accuracy, and alignment with human preferences.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19299v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-World Adversarial Attacks on RF-Based Drone Detectors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20712</link><description>arXiv:2512.20712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) based systems are increasingly used to detect drones by analyzing their RF signal patterns, converting them into spectrogram images which are processed by object detection models. Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitations. We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications. We evaluated the attack using RF recordings and OTA experiments with four types of drones. Our results show that modest, structured I/Q perturbations are compatible with standard RF chains and reliably reduce target drone detection while preserving detection of legitimate drones.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20712v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RefineBridge: Generative Bridge Models Improve Financial Forecasting by Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21572</link><description>arXiv:2512.21572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is particularly challenging for transformer-based time series foundation models (TSFMs) due to non-stationarity, heavy-tailed distributions, and high-frequency noise present in data. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained TSFMs to downstream data domains. However, it still underperforms in financial data, as it preserves the network architecture and training objective of TSFMs rather than complementing the foundation model. To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior. Simulations on multiple financial benchmarks demonstrate that RefineBridge consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs across different prediction horizons.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21572v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-agent Adaptive Mechanism Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21794</link><description>arXiv:2512.21794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a sequential mechanism design problem in which a principal seeks to elicit truthful reports from multiple rational agents while starting with no prior knowledge of agents' beliefs. We introduce Distributionally Robust Adaptive Mechanism (DRAM), a general framework combining insights from both mechanism design and online learning to jointly address truthfulness and cost-optimality. Throughout the sequential game, the mechanism estimates agents' beliefs and iteratively updates a distributionally robust linear program with shrinking ambiguity sets to reduce payments while preserving truthfulness. Our mechanism guarantees truthful reporting with high probability while achieving $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret, and we establish a matching lower bound showing that no truthful adaptive mechanism can asymptotically do better. The framework generalizes to plug-in estimators, supporting structured priors and delayed feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first adaptive mechanism under general settings that maintains truthfulness and achieves optimal regret when incentive constraints are unknown and must be learned.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21794v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SLIM-Brain: A Data- and Training-Efficient Foundation Model for fMRI Data Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21881</link><description>arXiv:2512.21881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21881v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Context: A Unified Framework and Roadmap for Context-Aware AI in Education</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24362</link><description>arXiv:2512.24362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified Learning Context (LC) framework designed to transition AI-based education from context-blind mimicry to a principled, holistic understanding of the learner. This white paper provides a multidisciplinary roadmap for making teaching and learning systems context-aware by encoding cognitive, affective, and sociocultural factors over the short, medium, and long term. To realize this vision, we outline concrete steps to operationalize LC theory into an interoperable computational data structure. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we will enable a wide range of AI tools to "warm-start" with durable context and achieve continual, long-term personalization. Finally, we detail our particular LC implementation strategy through the OpenStax digital learning platform ecosystem and SafeInsights R&amp;amp;D infrastructure. Using OpenStax's national reach, we are embedding the LC into authentic educational settings to support millions of learners. All research and pedagogical interventions are conducted within SafeInsights' privacy-preserving data enclaves, ensuring a privacy-first implementation that maintains high ethical standards while reducing equity gaps nationwide.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24362v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards a Benchmark for Dependency Decision-Making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00205</link><description>arXiv:2601.00205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI coding agents increasingly modify real software repositories and make dependency decisions, including adding, removing, or updating third-party packages. These choices can materially affect security posture and maintenance burden, yet repository-level evaluations largely emphasize test passing and executability without explicitly scoring whether systems (i) reuse existing dependencies, (ii) avoid unnecessary additions, or (iii) select versions that satisfy security and policy constraints.
  We propose DepDec-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating dependency decision-making beyond functional correctness. To ground DepDec-Bench in real-world behavior, we conduct a preliminary study of 117,062 dependency changes from agent- and human-authored pull requests across seven ecosystems. We show that coding agents frequently make dependency decisions with security consequences that remain invisible to test-focused evaluation: agents select PR-time known-vulnerable versions (2.46%) and exhibit net-negative security impact overall (net impact -98 vs. +1,316 for humans). These observations inform DepDec-Bench task families and metrics that evaluate safe version selection, reuse discipline, and restraint against dependency bloat alongside test passing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00205v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Delta Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00417</link><description>arXiv:2601.00417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effectiveness of deep residual networks hinges on the identity shortcut connection. While this mechanism alleviates the vanishing-gradient problem, it also has a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, limiting the network's ability to model complex hidden state transitions. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Deep Delta Learning (DDL)}, which generalizes the shortcut from a fixed identity map to a learnable, state-dependent linear operator. The resulting Delta Operator is a rank-1 perturbation of the identity, $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{X}) = \mathbf{I}- \beta(\mathbf{X})\mathbf{k} (\mathbf{X}) \mathbf{k} (\mathbf{X})^\top$, parameterized by a unit direction $\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{X})$ and a scalar gate $\beta(\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis showing that $\beta(\mathbf{X})$ continuously interpolates the shortcut between identity ($\beta=0$), orthogonal projection ($\beta=1$), and Householder reflection ($\beta=2$). Furthermore, we rewrite the residual update as a synchronized rank-1 delta write: $\beta$ scales both the removal of the current $\mathbf{k}$-component and the injection of the new $\mathbf{k}$-component. This unification enables explicit control of the shortcut spectrum along a data-dependent direction while retaining stable training behavior.

However, widely used pairwise GRMs create a computational bottleneck in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), when calibrating or aggregating preference signals over n candidates, often incurring O(n^2) pairwise judgments. To address this issue, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Modeling (IRPM), an RL-based method that extends the Bradley--Terry preference-learning paradigm via intergroup comparisons to train pointwise GRMs from pairwise preference data. IRPM derives pointwise reward for each response by contrasting groups of chosen vs. rejected samples, enabling pointwise scores comparable across candidate sets and O(n) reward evaluation for a variable number of candidates during RL training, while preserving interpretability and scalability. Experiments show that IRPM achieves state-of-the-art performance among pointwise GRMs on RM-Bench, JudgeBench and RewardBench, and approaches the performance of leading pairwise GRMs. In addition, IRPM achieves substantial gains in post-training evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00677v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transparent Semantic Change Detection with Dependency-Based Profiles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02891</link><description>arXiv:2601.02891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most modern computational approaches to lexical semantic change detection (LSC) rely on embedding-based distributional word representations with neural networks. Despite the strong performance on LSC benchmarks, they are often opaque. We investigate an alternative method which relies purely on dependency co-occurrence patterns of words. We demonstrate that it is effective for semantic change detection and even outperforms a number of distributional semantic models. We provide an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the predictions, showing that they are plausible and interpretable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02891v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AnimatedLLM: Explaining LLMs with Interactive Visualizations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04213</link><description>arXiv:2601.04213v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Current multi-agent LLM frameworks rely on explicit orchestration patterns borrowed from human organizational structures: planners delegate to executors, managers coordinate workers, and hierarchical control flow governs agent interactions. These approaches suffer from coordination overhead that scales poorly with agent count and task complexity. We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions. Empirically, on meeting room scheduling across 1,350 trials, pressure-field coordination outperforms all baselines: 48.5% aggregate solve rate versus 12.6% for conversation-based coordination, 1.5% for hierarchical control, and 0.4% for sequential and random baselines (all pairwise comparisons p &lt; 0.001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it reduces solve rate by 10 percentage points. On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 86.7% solve rate. The approach maintains consistent performance from 1 to 4 agents. Implicit coordination through shared pressure gradients outperforms explicit hierarchical control, suggesting that constraint-driven emergence offers a simpler and more effective foundation for multi-agent AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08129v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepResearch Bench II: Diagnosing Deep Research Agents via Rubrics from Expert Report</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08536</link><description>arXiv:2601.08536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Research Systems (DRS) aim to help users search the web, synthesize information, and deliver comprehensive investigative reports. However, how to rigorously evaluate these systems remains under-explored. Existing deep-research benchmarks often fall into two failure modes. Some do not adequately test a system's ability to analyze evidence and write coherent reports. Others rely on evaluation criteria that are either overly coarse or directly defined by LLMs (or both), leading to scores that can be biased relative to human experts and are hard to verify or interpret. To address these issues, we introduce Deep Research Bench II, a new benchmark for evaluating DRS-generated reports. It contains 132 grounded research tasks across 22 domains; for each task, a system must produce a long-form research report that is evaluated by a set of 9430 fine-grained binary rubrics in total, covering three dimensions: information recall, analysis, and presentation. All rubrics are derived from carefully selected expert-written investigative articles and are constructed through a four-stage LLM+human pipeline that combines automatic extraction with over 400 human-hours of expert review, ensuring that the criteria are atomic, verifiable, and aligned with human expert judgment. We evaluate several state-of-the-art deep-research systems on Deep Research Bench II and find that even the strongest models satisfy fewer than 50% of the rubrics, revealing a substantial gap between current DRSs and human experts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08536v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion-based Frameworks for Unsupervised Speech Enhancement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09931</link><description>arXiv:2601.09931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses unsupervised diffusion-based single-channel speech enhancement (SE). Prior work in this direction combines a score-based diffusion model trained on clean speech with a Gaussian noise model whose covariance is structured by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). This combination is used within an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) scheme, in which a diffusion-based posterior-sampling E-step estimates the clean speech. We first revisit this framework and propose to explicitly model both speech and acoustic noise as latent variables, jointly sampling them in the E-step instead of sampling speech alone as in previous approaches. We then introduce a new unsupervised SE framework that replaces the NMF noise prior with a diffusion-based noise model, learned jointly with the speech prior in a single conditional score model. Within this framework, we derive two variants: one that implicitly accounts for noise and one that explicitly treats noise as a latent variable. Experiments on WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND show that explicit noise modeling systematically improves SE performance for both NMF-based and diffusion-based noise priors. Under matched conditions, the diffusion-based noise model attains the best overall quality and intelligibility among unsupervised methods, while under mismatched conditions the proposed NMF-based explicit-noise framework is more robust and suffers less degradation than several supervised baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09931v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HumanLLM: Benchmarking and Improving LLM Anthropomorphism via Human Cognitive Patterns</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10198</link><description>arXiv:2601.10198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and generation, serving as the foundation for advanced persona simulation and Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs). However, achieving authentic alignment with human cognitive and behavioral patterns remains a critical challenge for these agents. We present HumanLLM, a framework treating psychological patterns as interacting causal forces. We construct 244 patterns from ~12,000 academic papers and synthesize 11,359 scenarios where 2-5 patterns reinforce, conflict, or modulate each other, with multi-turn conversations expressing inner thoughts, actions, and dialogue. Our dual-level checklists evaluate both individual pattern fidelity and emergent multi-pattern dynamics, achieving strong human alignment (r=0.91) while revealing that holistic metrics conflate simulation accuracy with social desirability. HumanLLM-8B outperforms Qwen3-32B on multi-pattern dynamics despite 4x fewer parameters, demonstrating that authentic anthropomorphism requires cognitive modeling--simulating not just what humans do, but the psychological processes generating those behaviors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10198v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Inpainting: Unleash 3D Understanding for Precise Camera-Controlled Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10214</link><description>arXiv:2601.10214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10214v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DanQing: An Up-to-Date Large-Scale Chinese Vision-Language Pre-training Dataset</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10305</link><description>arXiv:2601.10305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models have achieved remarkable success by leveraging large-scale image-text pairs. While English-centric models like CLIP and SigLIP benefit from massive datasets (e.g., LAION-400M), the development of Chinese VLP remains bottlenecked by the lack of high-quality, large-scale open-source data. In this paper, we present DanQing, a large-scale Chinese cross-modal dataset containing 100 million high-quality image-text pairs curated from Common Crawl. To ensure superior data quality, we develop an effective systematic pipeline comprising data source selection, text refinement, visual diversification, and cross-modal cross-batch filtering, thereby effectively mitigating the intrinsic noise prevalent in web data. Notably, DanQing incorporates data from 2024-2025, enabling models to capture contemporary semantic trends and emerging concepts. Extensive experiments via continued pretraining of SigLIP2 models demonstrate that DanQing consistently outperforms existing Chinese datasets across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and Chinese-centric large multimodal model tasks. Furthermore, in-depth analysis of DanQing reveals that it exhibits a more balanced semantic distribution and superior scaling capability compared to existing datasets. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10305v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks via In-Decoding Safety-Awareness Probing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10543</link><description>arXiv:2601.10543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce monoidal rewriting systems (MRS), an abstraction of string rewriting in which reductions are defined over an arbitrary ambient monoid rather than a free monoid of words. This shift is partly motivated by logic: the class of free monoids is not first-order axiomatizable, so "working in the free setting" cannot be treated internally when applying first-order methods to rewriting presentations.
  To analyze these systems categorically, we define $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ as the 2-category of Noetherian Confluent MRS. We then prove the existence of a canonical biadjunction between $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ and $\mathbf{Mon}$.
  Finally, we classify all Noetherian Confluent MRS that present a given fixed monoid. For this, we introduce Generalized Elementary Tietze Transformations (GETTs) and prove that any two presentations of a monoid are connected by a (possibly infinite) sequence of these transformations, yielding a complete characterization of generating systems up to GETT-equivalence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10564v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ATOD: An Evaluation Framework and Benchmark for Agentic Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11854</link><description>arXiv:2601.11854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, driven by large language models (LLMs) with extensive API and tool integration, have enabled conversational agents to coordinate interleaved goals, maintain long-horizon context, and act proactively through asynchronous execution. These capabilities extend beyond traditional TOD systems, yet existing benchmarks lack systematic support for evaluating such agentic behaviors. To address this gap, we introduce ATOD, a benchmark and synthetic dialogue generation pipeline that produces richly annotated conversations requiring long-term reasoning. ATOD captures key characteristics of advanced TOD, including multi-goal coordination, dependency management, memory, adaptability, and proactivity. Building on ATOD, we propose ATOD-Eval, a holistic evaluation framework that translates these dimensions into fine-grained metrics and supports reproducible offline and online evaluation. We further present a strong agentic memory-based evaluator for benchmarking on ATOD. Experiments show that ATOD-Eval enables comprehensive assessment across task completion, agentic capability, and response quality, and that the proposed evaluator offers a better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to existing memory- and LLM-based approaches under this evaluation setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11854v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Less is More: Label-Guided Summarization of Procedural and Instructional Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12243</link><description>arXiv:2601.12243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video summarization helps turn long videos into clear, concise representations that are easier to review, document, and analyze, especially in high-stakes domains like surgical training. Prior work has progressed from using basic visual features like color, motion, and structural changes to using pre-trained vision-language models that can better understand what's happening in the video (semantics) and capture temporal flow, resulting in more context-aware video summarization. We propose a three-stage framework, PRISM: Procedural Representation via Integrated Semantic and Multimodal analysis, that produces semantically grounded video summaries. PRISM combines adaptive visual sampling, label-driven keyframe anchoring, and contextual validation using a large language model (LLM). Our method ensures that selected frames reflect meaningful and procedural transitions while filtering out generic or hallucinated content, resulting in contextually coherent summaries across both domain-specific and instructional videos. We evaluate our method on instructional and activity datasets, using reference summaries for instructional videos. Despite sampling fewer than 5% of the original frames, our summaries retain 84% semantic content while improving over baselines by as much as 33%. Our approach generalizes across procedural and domain-specific video tasks, achieving strong performance with both semantic alignment and precision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12243v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion-Driven Synthetic Tabular Data Generation for Enhanced DoS/DDoS Attack Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13197</link><description>arXiv:2601.13197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Class imbalance refers to a situation where certain classes in a dataset have significantly fewer samples than oth- ers, leading to biased model performance.

Our approach synthesizes high-fidelity minority-class samples from the CIC-IDS2017 dataset through iterative denoising processes. For the minority classes that have smaller samples, synthetic samples were generated and merged with the original dataset. The augmented training data enables an ANN classifier to achieve near-perfect recall on previously underrepresented attack classes. These results establish diffusion models as an effective solution for tabular data imbalance in security domains, with potential applications in fraud detection and medical diagnostics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13197v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgenticRed: Optimizing Agentic Systems for Automated Red-teaming</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13518</link><description>arXiv:2601.13518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent automated red-teaming methods show promise for systematically exposing model vulnerabilities, most existing approaches rely on human-specified workflows. This dependence on manually designed workflows suffers from human biases and makes exploring the broader design space expensive. We introduce AgenticRed, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs' in-context learning to iteratively design and refine red-teaming systems without human intervention. Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench. Our approach exhibits strong transferability to proprietary models, achieving 100% ASR on GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o, and 60% on Claude-Sonnet-3.5 (24% improvement).

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) is widely used across domains, yet most existing methods assume regular sampling and fixed output resolutions. These assumptions are often violated in practice, where observations are irregular and sparse, while downstream applications require continuous and high-resolution TS. Although Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) is promising for modeling irregular TS, it is constrained by a single dynamics function, tightly coupled optimization, and limited ability to adapt learned dynamics to newly generated samples from the generative model. We propose Diff-MN, a continuous TSG framework that enhances NCDE with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) dynamics function and a decoupled architectural design for dynamics-focused training. To further enable NCDE to generalize to newly generated samples, Diff-MN employs a diffusion model to parameterize the NCDE temporal dynamics parameters (MoE weights), i.e., jointly learn the distribution of TS data and MoE weights. This design allows sample-specific NCDE parameters to be generated for continuous TS generation. Experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate that Diff-MN consistently outperforms strong baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous TSG tasks. The code is available at the link https://github.com/microsoft/TimeCraft/tree/main/Diff-MN.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13534v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vulnerability of LLMs' Belief Systems?

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in various question-answering tasks. However, recent studies showcase that LLMs are susceptible to persuasion and could adopt counterfactual beliefs. We present a systematic evaluation of LLM susceptibility to persuasion under the Source--Message--Channel--Receiver (SMCR) communication framework. Across five mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) and three domains (factual knowledge, medical QA, and social bias), we analyze how different persuasive strategies influence belief stability over multiple interaction turns. We further examine whether meta-cognition prompting (i.e., eliciting self-reported confidence) affects resistance to persuasion. Results show that the smallest model (Llama 3.2-3B) exhibits extreme compliance, with 82.5% of belief changes occurring at the first persuasive turn (average end turn of 1.1--1.4). Contrary to expectations, meta-cognition prompting increases vulnerability by accelerating belief erosion rather than enhancing robustness. Finally, we evaluate adversarial fine-tuning as a defense. While GPT-4o-mini achieves near-complete robustness (98.6%) and Mistral~7B improves substantially (35.7% $\rightarrow$ 79.3%), Llama models remain highly susceptible (&lt;14%) even when fine-tuned on their own failure cases. Together, these findings highlight substantial model-dependent limits of current robustness interventions and offer guidance for developing more trustworthy LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13590v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FastGHA: Generalized Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Head Avatars with Real-Time Animation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13837</link><description>arXiv:2601.13837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D Gaussian-based head avatar modeling, efficiently generating high fidelity avatars remains a challenge. Current methods typically rely on extensive multi-view capture setups or monocular videos with per-identity optimization during inference, limiting their scalability and ease of use on unseen subjects. To overcome these efficiency drawbacks, we propose FastGHA, a feed-forward method to generate high-quality Gaussian head avatars from only a few input images while supporting real-time animation. Our approach directly learns a per-pixel Gaussian representation from the input images, and aggregates multi-view information using a transformer-based encoder that fuses image features from both DINOv3 and Stable Diffusion VAE. For real-time animation, we extend the explicit Gaussian representations with per-Gaussian features and introduce a lightweight MLP-based dynamic network to predict 3D Gaussian deformations from expression codes. Furthermore, to enhance geometric smoothness of the 3D head, we employ point maps from a pre-trained large reconstruction model as geometry supervision. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both rendering quality and inference efficiency, while supporting real-time dynamic avatar animation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13837v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TwinBrainVLA: Unleashing the Potential of Generalist VLMs for Embodied Tasks via Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14133</link><description>arXiv:2601.14133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental premise of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is to harness the extensive general capabilities of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for generalized embodied intelligence. However, standard robotic fine-tuning inevitably disrupts the pre-trained feature space, leading to "catastrophic forgetting" that compromises the general visual understanding we aim to leverage. To effectively utilize the uncorrupted general capabilities of VLMs for robotic tasks, we propose TwinBrainVLA, which coordinates two isomorphic VLM pathways: a frozen generalist (also called "Left Brain") and a trainable specialist (also called "Right Brain"). Our architecture utilizes a Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism, enabling the Right Brain to dynamically query and fuse intact semantic knowledge from the Left Brain with proprioceptive states. This fused representation conditions a flow-matching action expert for precise continuous control. Empirical results on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa benchmarks demonstrate that by explicitly retaining general capabilities, TwinBrainVLA achieves substantial performance gains over baseline models in complex manipulation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14133v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transparent Malware Detection With Granular Assembly Flow Explainability via Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14511</link><description>arXiv:2601.14511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As malware continues to become increasingly sophisticated, threatening, and evasive, malware detection systems must keep pace and become equally intelligent, powerful, and transparent. In this paper, we propose Assembly Flow Graph (AFG) to comprehensively represent the assembly flow of a binary executable as graph data. Importantly, AFG can be used to extract granular explanations needed to increase transparency for malware detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, since AFGs may be large in practice, we also propose a Meta-Coarsening approach to improve computational tractability via graph reduction. To evaluate our proposed approach we consider several novel and existing metrics to quantify the granularity and quality of explanations. Lastly, we also consider several hyperparameters in our proposed Meta-Coarsening approach that can be used to control the final explanation size. We evaluate our proposed approach using the CIC-DGG-2025 dataset.

Abstract: Current evaluation methods for Attributed Question Answering (AQA) suffer from \textit{attribution myopia}: they emphasize verification of isolated statements and their attributions but overlook the global logical integrity of long-form answers. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce factually grounded yet logically incoherent responses with elusive deductive gaps. To mitigate this limitation, we present \textsc{LogicScore}, a unified evaluation framework that shifts the paradigm from local assessment to global reasoning scrutiny. Grounded in Horn Rules, our approach integrates a backward verification mechanism to systematically evaluate three key reasoning dimensions: \textit{Completeness} (logically sound deduction), \textit{Conciseness} (non-redundancy), and \textit{Determinateness} (consistent answer entailment). Extensive experiments across three multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, MusiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) and over 20 LLMs (including GPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, LLaMA3, and task-specific tuned models) reveal a critical capability gap: leading models often achieve high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85\% precision for Gemini-3 Pro) but struggle with global reasoning quality (e.g., 35.11\% Conciseness for Gemini-3 Pro). Our work establishes a robust standard for logical evaluation, highlighting the need to prioritize reasoning coherence alongside factual grounding in LLM development.

Abstract: The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development highlights the importance of energy-efficient software to reduce the global carbon footprint. Programming languages and execution models strongly influence software energy consumption, with interpreted languages generally being less efficient than compiled ones. Lua illustrates this trade-off: despite its popularity, it is less energy-efficient than greener and faster languages such as C.
  This paper presents an empirical study of Lua's runtime performance and energy efficiency across 25 official interpreter versions and just-in-time (JIT) compilers. Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter. Moreover, LuaJIT approaches C's efficiency, using roughly six times more energy and running about eight times slower, demonstrating the substantial benefits of JIT compilation for improving both performance and energy efficiency in interpreted languages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16670v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BibAgent: An Agentic Framework for Traceable Miscitation Detection in Scientific Literature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16993</link><description>arXiv:2601.16993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Citations are the bedrock of scientific authority, yet their integrity is compromised by widespread miscitations: ranging from nuanced distortions to fabricated references. Systematic citation verification is currently unfeasible; manual review cannot scale to modern publishing volumes, while existing automated tools are restricted by abstract-only analysis or small-scale, domain-specific datasets in part due to the "paywall barrier" of full-text access. We introduce BibAgent, a scalable, end-to-end agentic framework for automated citation verification. BibAgent integrates retrieval, reasoning, and adaptive evidence aggregation, applying distinct strategies for accessible and paywalled sources. For paywalled references, it leverages a novel Evidence Committee mechanism that infers citation validity via downstream citation consensus. To support systematic evaluation, we contribute a 5-category Miscitation Taxonomy and MisciteBench, a massive cross-disciplinary benchmark comprising 6,350 miscitation samples spanning 254 fields. Our results demonstrate that BibAgent outperforms state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) baselines in citation verification accuracy and interpretability, providing scalable, transparent detection of citation misalignments across the scientific literature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16993v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pipeline Inspection, Visualization, and Interoperability in PyTerrier</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17502</link><description>arXiv:2601.17502v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical image registration by achieving unprecedented speeds, yet its clinical application is hindered by a limited ability to generalize beyond the training domain, a critical weakness given the typically small scale of medical datasets.

Abstract: Autonomous systems increasingly require moral judgment capabilities, yet whether these capabilities scale predictably with model size remains unexplored. We systematically evaluate 75 large language model configurations (0.27B--1000B parameters) using the Moral Machine framework, measuring alignment with human preferences in life-death dilemmas. We observe a consistent power-law relationship with distance from human preferences ($D$) decreasing as $D \propto S^{-0.10\pm0.01}$ ($R^2=0.50$, $p&lt;0.001$) where $S$ is model size. Mixed-effects models confirm this relationship persists after controlling for model family and reasoning capabilities. Extended reasoning models show significantly better alignment, with this effect being more pronounced in smaller models (size$\times$reasoning interaction: $p = 0.024$). The relationship holds across diverse architectures, while variance decreases at larger scales, indicating systematic emergence of more reliable moral judgment with computational scale. These findings extend scaling law research to value-based judgments and provide empirical foundations for artificial intelligence governance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17637v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic reinforcement learning empowers next-generation chemical language models for molecular design and synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17687</link><description>arXiv:2601.17687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models are revolutionizing the biochemistry domain, assisting scientists in drug design and chemical synthesis with high efficiency. Yet current approaches struggle between small language models prone to hallucination and limited knowledge retention, and large cloud-based language models plagued by privacy risks and high inference costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChemCRAFT, a novel framework leveraging agentic reinforcement learning to decouple chemical reasoning from knowledge storage. Instead of forcing the model to memorize vast chemical data, our approach empowers the language model to interact with a sandbox for precise information retrieval. This externalization of knowledge allows a locally deployable small model to achieve superior performance with minimal inference costs. To enable small language models for agent-calling ability, we build an agentic trajectory construction pipeline and a comprehensive chemical-agent sandbox. Based on sandbox interactions, we constructed ChemToolDataset, the first large-scale chemical tool trajectory dataset. Simultaneously, we propose SMILES-GRPO to build a dense chemical reward function, promoting the model's ability to call chemical agents. Evaluations across diverse aspects of drug design show that ChemCRAFT outperforms current cloud-based LLMs in molecular structure analysis, molecular optimization, and synthesis pathway prediction, demonstrating that scientific reasoning is not solely an emergent ability of model scale, but a learnable policy of tool orchestration. This work establishes a cost-effective and privacy-preserving paradigm for AI-aided chemistry, opening new avenues for accelerating molecular discovery with locally deployable agents.

Abstract: In LLM inference, the same prompt may yield different outputs across different runs. At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism.
  Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions. Leveraging these insights, LLM-42 decodes tokens using a non-deterministic fast path and enforces determinism via a lightweight verify-rollback loop. The verifier replays candidate tokens under a fixed-shape reduction schedule, commits those that are guaranteed to be consistent across runs, and rolls back those violating determinism. LLM-42 mostly re-uses existing kernels unchanged and incurs overhead only in proportion to the traffic that requires determinism.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17768v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Expert Evaluation and the Limits of Human Feedback in Mental Health AI Safety Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18061</link><description>arXiv:2601.18061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from human feedback~(LHF) assumes that expert judgments, appropriately aggregated, yield valid ground truth for training and evaluating AI systems. We tested this assumption in mental health, where high safety stakes make expert consensus essential. Three certified psychiatrists independently evaluated LLM-generated responses using a calibrated rubric. Despite similar training and shared instructions, inter-rater reliability was consistently poor ($ICC$ $0.087$--$0.295$), falling below thresholds considered acceptable for consequential assessment. Disagreement was highest on the most safety-critical items. Suicide and self-harm responses produced greater divergence than any other category, and was systematic rather than random. One factor yielded negative reliability (Krippendorff's $\alpha = -0.203$), indicating structured disagreement worse than chance. Qualitative interviews revealed that disagreement reflects coherent but incompatible individual clinical frameworks, safety-first, engagement-centered, and culturally-informed orientations, rather than measurement error. By demonstrating that experts rely on holistic risk heuristics rather than granular factor discrimination, these findings suggest that aggregated labels function as arithmetic compromises that effectively erase grounded professional philosophies. Our results characterize expert disagreement in safety-critical AI as a sociotechnical phenomenon where professional experience introduces sophisticated layers of principled divergence. We discuss implications for reward modeling, safety classification, and evaluation benchmarks, recommending that practitioners shift from consensus-based aggregation to alignment methods that preserve and learn from expert disagreement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18061v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MalURLBench: A Benchmark Evaluating Agents' Vulnerabilities When Processing Web URLs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18113</link><description>arXiv:2601.18113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based web agents have become increasingly popular for their utility in daily life and work. However, they exhibit critical vulnerabilities when processing malicious URLs: accepting a disguised malicious URL enables subsequent access to unsafe webpages, which can cause severe damage to service providers and users. Despite this risk, no benchmark currently targets this emerging threat. To address this gap, we propose MalURLBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' vulnerabilities to malicious URLs. MalURLBench contains 61,845 attack instances spanning 10 real-world scenarios and 7 categories of real malicious websites. Experiments with 12 popular LLMs reveal that existing models struggle to detect elaborately disguised malicious URLs. We further identify and analyze key factors that impact attack success rates and propose URLGuard, a lightweight defense module. We believe this work will provide a foundational resource for advancing the security of web agents.

Abstract: Forced alignment (FA) predicts start and end timestamps for words or characters in speech, but existing methods are language-specific and prone to cumulative temporal shifts. The multilingual speech understanding and long-sequence processing abilities of speech large language models (SLLMs) make them promising for FA in multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech settings. However, directly applying the next-token prediction paradigm of SLLMs to FA results in hallucinations and slow inference. To bridge the gap, we propose LLM-ForcedAligner, reformulating FA as a slot-filling paradigm: timestamps are treated as discrete indices, and special timestamp tokens are inserted as slots into the transcript. Conditioned on the speech embeddings and the transcript with slots, the SLLM directly predicts the time indices at slots. During training, causal attention masking with non-shifted input and label sequences allows each slot to predict its own timestamp index based on itself and preceding context, with loss computed only at slot positions. Dynamic slot insertion enables FA at arbitrary positions. Moreover, non-autoregressive inference is supported, avoiding hallucinations and improving speed. Experiments across multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech scenarios show that LLM-ForcedAligner achieves a 69%~78% relative reduction in accumulated averaging shift compared with prior methods.

Abstract: In recent years, safety risks associated with large language models have become increasingly prominent, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate the generation of toxic and harmful content. The mainstream paradigm for LLM safety alignment typically adopts a collaborative framework involving three roles: an attacker for adversarial prompt generation, a defender for safety defense, and an evaluator for response assessment. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop reinforcement learning framework called TriPlay-RL that enables iterative and co-improving collaboration among three roles with near-zero manual annotation. Experimental results show that the attacker preserves high output diversity while achieving a 20%-50% improvement in adversarial effectiveness; the defender attains 10%-30% gains in safety performance without degrading general reasoning capability; and the evaluator continuously refines its fine-grained judgment ability through iterations, accurately distinguishing unsafe responses, simple refusals, and useful guidance. Overall, our framework establishes an efficient and scalable paradigm for LLM safety alignment, enabling continuous co-evolution within a unified learning loop.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18292v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conformal Prediction Algorithms for Time Series Forecasting: Methods and Benchmarking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18509</link><description>arXiv:2601.18509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is of critical importance in time series forecasting, yet traditional methods often rely on restrictive distributional assumptions. Conformal prediction (CP) has emerged as a promising distribution-free framework for generating prediction intervals with rigorous theoretical guarantees. However, applying CP to sequential data presents a primary challenge: the temporal dependencies inherent in time series fundamentally violate the core assumption of data exchangeability, upon which standard CP guarantees are built. This paper critically examines the main categories of algorithmic solutions designed to address this conflict. We survey and benchmark methods that relax the exchangeability assumption, those that redefine the data unit to be a collection of independent time series, approaches that explicitly model the dynamics of the prediction residuals, and online learning algorithms that adapt to distribution shifts to maintain long-run coverage. We use AutoARIMA as the base forecaster on a large-scale monthly sales dataset, evaluating marginal coverage, interval width, and the Winkler score. Our benchmark results show that multi-step split conformal prediction method meets the 90% coverage threshold and demonstrates the best efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18509v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Cold Start to Active Learning: Embedding-Based Scan Selection for Medical Image Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18532</link><description>arXiv:2601.18532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation annotations are critical for disease monitoring, yet manual labeling remains a major bottleneck due to the time and expertise required. Active learning (AL) alleviates this burden by prioritizing informative samples for annotation, typically through a diversity-based cold-start phase followed by uncertainty-driven selection. We propose a novel cold-start sampling strategy that combines foundation-model embeddings with clustering, including automatic selection of the number of clusters and proportional sampling across clusters, to construct a diverse and representative initial training. This is followed by an uncertainty-based AL framework that integrates spatial diversity to guide sample selection. The proposed method is intuitive and interpretable, enabling visualization of the feature-space distribution of candidate samples. We evaluate our approach on three datasets spanning X-ray and MRI modalities. On the CheXmask dataset, the cold-start strategy outperforms random selection, improving Dice from 0.918 to 0.929 and reducing the Hausdorff distance from 32.41 to 27.66 mm. In the AL setting, combined entropy and diversity selection improves Dice from 0.919 to 0.939 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 30.10 to 19.16 mm. On the Montgomery dataset, cold-start gains are substantial, with Dice improving from 0.928 to 0.950 and Hausdorff distance decreasing from 14.22 to 9.38 mm. On the SynthStrip dataset, cold-start selection slightly affects Dice but reduces the Hausdorff distance from 9.43 to 8.69 mm, while active learning improves Dice from 0.816 to 0.826 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 7.76 to 6.38 mm. Overall, the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods in low-data regimes, improving segmentation accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18532v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explainability Methods for Hardware Trojan Detection: A Systematic Comparison</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18696</link><description>arXiv:2601.18696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardware trojan detection requires accurate identification and interpretable explanations for security engineers to validate and act on results. This work compares three explainability categories for gate-level trojan detection on the Trust-Hub benchmark: (1) domain-aware property-based analysis of 31 circuit-specific features from gate fanin patterns, flip-flop distances, and I/O connectivity; (2) case-based reasoning using k-nearest neighbors for precedent-based explanations; and (3) model-agnostic feature attribution (LIME, SHAP, gradient).
  Results show different advantages per approach. Property-based analysis provides explanations through circuit concepts like "high fanin complexity near outputs indicates potential triggers." Case-based reasoning achieves 97.4% correspondence between predictions and training exemplars, offering justifications grounded in precedent. LIME and SHAP provide feature attributions with strong inter-method correlation (r=0.94, p&lt;0.001) but lack circuit-level context for validation.
  XGBoost classification achieves 46.15% precision and 52.17% recall on 11,392 test samples, a 9-fold precision improvement over prior work (Hasegawa et al.: 5.13%) while reducing false positive rates from 5.6% to 0.25%. Gradient-based attribution runs 481 times faster than SHAP but provides similar domain-opaque insights.
  This work demonstrates that property-based and case-based approaches offer domain alignment and precedent-based interpretability compared to generic feature rankings, with implications for XAI deployment where practitioners must validate ML predictions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18696v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Establishing dermatopathology encyclopedia DermpathNet with Artificial Intelligence-Based Workflow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19378</link><description>arXiv:2601.19378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accessing high-quality, open-access dermatopathology image datasets for learning and cross-referencing is a common challenge for clinicians and dermatopathology trainees. To establish a comprehensive open-access dermatopathology dataset for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes, we employed a hybrid workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) repository. We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6% for the deep learning approach, 61.0% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4% for the hybrid approach. We retrieved over 7,772 images across 166 diagnoses and released this fully annotated dataset, reviewed by board-certified dermatopathologists. Using our dataset as a challenging task, we found the current image analysis algorithm from OpenAI inadequate for analyzing dermatopathology images. In conclusion, we have developed a large, peer-reviewed, open-access dermatopathology image dataset, DermpathNet, which features a semi-automated curation workflow.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19378v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RPO:Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19404</link><description>arXiv:2601.19404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) architectures have achieved significant successes in LLMs, inspiring explorations for video generation. In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual quality and structural stability compared to static top-k/top-p strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19488v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AACR-Bench: Evaluating Automatic Code Review with Holistic Repository-Level Context</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19494</link><description>arXiv:2601.19494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality evaluation benchmarks are pivotal for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Code Review (ACR). However, existing benchmarks suffer from two critical limitations: first, the lack of multi-language support in repository-level contexts, which restricts the generalizability of evaluation results; second, the reliance on noisy, incomplete ground truth derived from raw Pull Request (PR) comments, which constrains the scope of issue detection. To address these challenges, we introduce AACR-Bench a comprehensive benchmark that provides full cross-file context across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional datasets, AACR-Bench employs an "AI-assisted, Expert-verified" annotation pipeline to uncover latent defects often overlooked in original PRs, resulting in a 285% increase in defect coverage. Extensive evaluations of mainstream LLMs on AACR-Bench reveal that previous assessments may have either misjudged or only partially captured model capabilities due to data limitations.

Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods rely on a rigid mapping from parameter or module modifications to output, which causes the generalization limitation in Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19700v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Post-LayerNorm Is Back: Stable, ExpressivE, and Deep</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19895</link><description>arXiv:2601.19895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19895v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CiMRAG: CiM-Aware Domain-Adaptive and Noise-Resilient Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Edge-Based LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20041</link><description>arXiv:2601.20041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized virtual assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) on edge devices are attracting growing attention, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a key method for personalization by retrieving relevant profile data and generating tailored responses. However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on personalization benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our methods relative to strong baselines, especially in task-specific noisy scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20041v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distributional value gradients for stochastic environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20071</link><description>arXiv:2601.20071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient-regularized value learning methods improve sample efficiency by leveraging learned models of transition dynamics and rewards to estimate return gradients. However, existing approaches, such as MAGE, struggle in stochastic or noisy environments, limiting their applicability. In this work, we address these limitations by extending distributional reinforcement learning on continuous state-action spaces to model not only the distribution over scalar state-action value functions but also over their gradients. We refer to this approach as Distributional Sobolev Training. Inspired by Stochastic Value Gradients (SVG), our method utilizes a one-step world model of reward and transition distributions implemented via a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE). The proposed framework is sample-based and employs Max-sliced Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MSMMD) to instantiate the distributional Bellman operator. We prove that the Sobolev-augmented Bellman operator is a contraction with a unique fixed point, and highlight a fundamental smoothness trade-off underlying contraction in gradient-aware RL. To validate our method, we first showcase its effectiveness on a simple stochastic reinforcement learning toy problem, then benchmark its performance on several MuJoCo environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20071v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trajectory2Task: Training Robust Tool-Calling Agents with Synthesized Yet Verifiable Data for Complex User Intents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20144</link><description>arXiv:2601.20144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tool-calling agents are increasingly deployed in real-world customer-facing workflows. Yet most studies on tool-calling agents focus on idealized settings with general, fixed, and well-specified tasks. In real-world applications, user requests are often (1) ambiguous, (2) changing over time, or (3) infeasible due to policy constraints, and training and evaluation data that cover these diverse, complex interaction patterns remain under-represented. To bridge the gap, we present Trajectory2Task, a verifiable data generation pipeline for studying tool use at scale under three realistic user scenarios: ambiguous intent, changing intent, and infeasible intents. The pipeline first conducts multi-turn exploration to produce valid tool-call trajectories. It then converts these trajectories into user-facing tasks with controlled intent adaptations. This process yields verifiable task that support closed-loop evaluation and training. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art LLMs on the generated complex user scenario tasks and observe frequent failures. Finally, using successful trajectories obtained from task rollouts, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs and find consistent improvements across all three conditions, along with better generalization to unseen tool-use domains, indicating stronger general tool-calling ability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20144v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Supporting Informed Self-Disclosure: Design Recommendations for Presenting AI-Estimates of Privacy Risks to Users</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20161</link><description>arXiv:2601.20161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People candidly discuss sensitive topics online under the perceived safety of anonymity; yet, for many, this perceived safety is tenuous, as miscalibrated risk perceptions can lead to over-disclosure. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) afford an unprecedented opportunity to present users with quantified disclosure-based re-identification risk (i.e., "population risk estimates", PREs). How can PREs be presented to users in a way that promotes informed decision-making, mitigating risk without encouraging unnecessary self-censorship? Using design fictions and comic-boarding, we story-boarded five design concepts for presenting PREs to users and evaluated them through an online survey with N = 44 Reddit users. We found participants had detailed conceptions of how PREs may impact risk awareness and motivation, but envisioned needing additional context and support to effectively interpret and act on risks. We distill our findings into four key design recommendations for how best to present users with quantified privacy risks to support informed disclosure decision-making.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20161v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TaF-VLA: Tactile-Force Alignment in Vision-Language-Action Models for Force-aware Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20321</link><description>arXiv:2601.20321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as powerful generalists for robotic manipulation. However, due to their predominant reliance on visual modalities, they fundamentally lack the physical intuition required for contact-rich tasks that require precise force regulation and physical reasoning. Existing attempts to incorporate vision-based tactile sensing into VLA models typically treat tactile inputs as auxiliary visual textures, thereby overlooking the underlying correlation between surface deformation and interaction dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm shift from tactile-vision alignment to tactile-force alignment. Here, we introduce TaF-VLA, a framework that explicitly grounds high-dimensional tactile observations in physical interaction forces. To facilitate this, we develop an automated tactile-force data acquisition device and curate the TaF-Dataset, comprising over 10 million synchronized tactile observations, 6-axis force/torque, and matrix force map. To align sequential tactile observations with interaction forces, the central component of our approach is the Tactile-Force Adapter (TaF-Adapter), a tactile sensor encoder that extracts discretized latent information for encoding tactile observations. This mechanism ensures that the learned representations capture history-dependent, noise-insensitive physical dynamics rather than static visual textures. Finally, we integrate this force-aligned encoder into a VLA backbone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that TaF-VLA policy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tactile-vision-aligned and vision-only baselines on contact-rich tasks, verifying its ability to achieve robust, force-aware manipulation through cross-modal physical reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20321v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MARE: Multimodal Alignment and Reinforcement for Explainable Deepfake Detection via Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20433</link><description>arXiv:2601.20433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deepfake detection is a widely researched topic that is crucial for combating the spread of malicious content, with existing methods mainly modeling the problem as classification or spatial localization. The rapid advancements in generative models impose new demands on Deepfake detection. In this paper, we propose multimodal alignment and reinforcement for explainable Deepfake detection via vision-language models, termed MARE, which aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in Deepfake detection and reasoning. Specifically, MARE designs comprehensive reward functions, incorporating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to incentivize the generation of text-spatially aligned reasoning content that adheres to human preferences. Besides, MARE introduces a forgery disentanglement module to capture intrinsic forgery traces from high-level facial semantics, thereby improving its authenticity detection capability. We conduct thorough evaluations on the reasoning content generated by MARE. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that MARE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and reliability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20433v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Piloting Planetarium Visualizations with LLMs during Live Events in Science Centers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20466</link><description>arXiv:2601.20466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We designed and evaluated an AI pilot in a planetarium visualization software, OpenSpace, for public shows in science centers. The piloting role is usually given to a human working in close collaboration with the guide on stage. We recruited 7 professional guides with extensive experience in giving shows to the public to study the impact of the AI-piloting on the overall experience. The AI-pilot is a conversational AI-agent listening to the guide and interpreting the verbal statements as commands to execute camera motions, change simulation time, or toggle visual assets. Our results show that, while AI pilots lack several critical skills for live shows, they could become useful as co-pilots to reduce workload of human pilots and allow multitasking. We propose research directions toward implementing visualization pilots and co-pilots in live settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20466v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Practical Framework of Key Performance Indicators for Multi-Robot Lunar and Planetary Field Tests</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20529</link><description>arXiv:2601.20529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic prospecting for critical resources on the Moon, such as ilmenite, rare earth elements, and water ice, requires robust exploration methods given the diverse terrain and harsh environmental conditions. Although numerous analog field trials address these goals, comparing their results remains challenging because of differences in robot platforms and experimental setups. These missions typically assess performance using selected, scenario-specific engineering metrics that fail to establish a clear link between field performance and science-driven objectives. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving a structured framework of KPI from three realistic multi-robot lunar scenarios reflecting scientific objectives and operational constraints. Our framework emphasizes scenario-dependent priorities in efficiency, robustness, and precision, and is explicitly designed for practical applicability in field deployments. We validated the framework in a multi-robot field test and found it practical and easy to apply for efficiency- and robustness-related KPI, whereas precision-oriented KPI require reliable ground-truth data that is not always feasible to obtain in outdoor analog environments. Overall, we propose this framework as a common evaluation standard enabling consistent, goal-oriented comparison of multi-robot field trials and supporting systematic development of robotic systems for future planetary exploration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20529v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inequality in Congestion Games with Learning Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20578</link><description>arXiv:2601.20578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Who benefits from expanding transport networks? While designed to improve mobility, such interventions can also create inequality. In this paper, we show that disparities arise not only from the structure of the network itself but also from differences in how commuters adapt to it. We model commuters as reinforcement learning agents who adapt their travel choices at different learning rates, reflecting unequal access to resources and information. To capture potential efficiency-fairness tradeoffs, we introduce the Price of Learning (PoL), a measure of inefficiency during learning. We analyze both a stylized network -- inspired in the well-known Braess's paradox, yet with two-source nodes -- and an abstraction of a real-world metro system (Amsterdam). Our simulations show that network expansions can simultaneously increase efficiency and amplify inequality, especially when faster learners disproportionately benefit from new routes before others adapt. These results highlight that transport policies must account not only for equilibrium outcomes but also for the heterogeneous ways commuters adapt, since both shape the balance between efficiency and fairness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20578v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgentIF-OneDay: A Task-level Instruction-Following Benchmark for General AI Agents in Daily Scenarios</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20613</link><description>arXiv:2601.20613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capacity of AI agents to effectively handle tasks of increasing duration and complexity continues to grow, demonstrating exceptional performance in coding, deep research, and complex problem-solving evaluations. However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20613v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgentLongBench: A Controllable Long Benchmark For Long-Contexts Agents via Environment Rollouts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20730</link><description>arXiv:2601.20730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20730v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ScaleFree: Dynamic KDE for Multiscale Point Cloud Exploration in VR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20758</link><description>arXiv:2601.20758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ScaleFree, a GPU-accelerated adaptive Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) algorithm for scalable, interactive multiscale point cloud exploration. With this technique, we cater to the massive datasets and complex multiscale structures in advanced scientific computing, such as cosmological simulations with billions of particles. Effective exploration of such data requires a full 3D understanding of spatial structures, a capability for which immersive environments such as VR are particularly well suited. However, simultaneously supporting global multiscale context and fine-grained local detail remains a significant challenge. A key difficulty lies in dynamically generating continuous density fields from point clouds to facilitate the seamless scale transitions: while KDE is widely used, precomputed fields restrict the accuracy of interaction and omit fine-scale structures, while dynamic computation is often too costly for real-time VR interaction. We address this challenge by leveraging GPU acceleration with k-d-tree-based spatial queries and parallel reduction within a thread group for on-the-fly density estimation. With this approach, we can recalculate scalar fields dynamically as users shift their focus across scales. We demonstrate the benefits of adaptive density estimation through two data exploration tasks: adaptive selection and progressive navigation. Through performance experiments, we demonstrate that ScaleFree with GPU-parallel implementation achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over sequential and multi-core CPU baselines. In a controlled experiment, we further confirm that our adaptive selection technique improves accuracy and efficiency in multiscale selection tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20758v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GNN Explanations that do not Explain and How to find Them</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20815</link><description>arXiv:2601.20815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explanations provided by Self-explainable Graph Neural Networks (SE-GNNs) are fundamental for understanding the model's inner workings and for identifying potential misuse of sensitive attributes. Although recent works have highlighted that these explanations can be suboptimal and potentially misleading, a characterization of their failure cases is unavailable. In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings. Our code is available in the supplemental.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20815v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Open-Vocabulary Functional 3D Human-Scene Interaction Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20835</link><description>arXiv:2601.20835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating 3D humans that functionally interact with 3D scenes remains an open problem with applications in embodied AI, robotics, and interactive content creation. The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as "sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., "increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20835v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IDE-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models as IDE Agents on Real-World Software Engineering Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20886</link><description>arXiv:2601.20886v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Adapting automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on large language models (LLMs) to new domains using text-only data is a significant yet underexplored challenge. Standard fine-tuning of the LLM on target-domain text often disrupts the critical alignment between speech and text modalities learned by the projector, degrading performance. We introduce a novel text-only adaptation method that emulates the audio projection task by treating it as a text denoising task. Our approach thus trains the LLM to recover clean transcripts from noisy inputs. This process effectively adapts the model to a target domain while preserving cross-modal alignment. Our solution is lightweight, requiring no architectural changes or additional parameters. Extensive evaluation on two datasets demonstrates up to 22.1% relative improvement, outperforming recent state-of-the-art text-only adaptation methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20900v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NEXUS: Bit-Exact ANN-to-SNN Equivalence via Neuromorphic Gate Circuits with Surrogate-Free Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21279</link><description>arXiv:2601.21279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient computing through event-driven sparsity, yet all existing approaches sacrifice accuracy by approximating continuous values with discrete spikes. We propose NEXUS, a framework that achieves bit-exact ANN-to-SNN equivalence -- not approximate, but mathematically identical outputs. Our key insight is constructing all arithmetic operations, both linear and nonlinear, from pure IF neuron logic gates that implement IEEE-754 compliant floating-point arithmetic. Through spatial bit encoding (zero encoding error by construction), hierarchical neuromorphic gate circuits (from basic logic gates to complete transformer layers), and surrogate-free STE training (exact identity mapping rather than heuristic approximation), NEXUS produces outputs identical to standard ANNs up to machine precision. Experiments on models up to LLaMA-2 70B demonstrate identical task accuracy (0.00% degradation) with mean ULP error of only 6.19, while achieving 27-168,000$\times$ energy reduction on neuromorphic hardware. Crucially, spatial bit encoding's single-timestep design renders the framework inherently immune to membrane potential leakage (100% accuracy across all decay factors $\beta\in[0.1,1.0]$), while tolerating synaptic noise up to $\sigma=0.2$ with &gt;98% gate-level accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21279v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Token Entropy Regularization for Multi-modal Antenna Affiliation Identification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21280</link><description>arXiv:2601.21280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate antenna affiliation identification is crucial for optimizing and maintaining communication networks. Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Qwen3-ASR family, which includes two powerful all-in-one speech recognition models and a novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21337v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generation Enhances Understanding in Unified Multimodal Models via Multi-Representation Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21406</link><description>arXiv:2601.21406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21406v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] L$^3$: Large Lookup Layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21461</link><description>arXiv:2601.21461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern sparse language models typically achieve sparsity through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, which dynamically route tokens to dense MLP "experts." However, dynamic hard routing has a number of drawbacks, such as potentially poor hardware efficiency and needing auxiliary losses for stable training. In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21461v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver for Accelerating Generative Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21542</link><description>arXiv:2601.21542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) models have emerged as a leading paradigm for high-fidelity synthesis. However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21542v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ASTRA: Automated Synthesis of agentic Trajectories and Reinforcement Arenas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21558</link><description>arXiv:2601.21558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as tool-augmented agents for multi-step decision making, yet training robust tool-using agents remains challenging. Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability.

Abstract: Predicting spatial gene expression from H&amp;amp;E histology offers a scalable and clinically accessible alternative to sequencing, but realizing clinical impact requires models that generalize across cancer types and capture biologically coherent signals. Prior work is often limited to per-cancer settings and variance-based evaluation, leaving functional relevance underexplored. We introduce HistoPrism, an efficient transformer-based architecture for pan-cancer prediction of gene expression from histology. To evaluate biological meaning, we introduce a pathway-level benchmark, shifting assessment from isolated gene-level variance to coherent functional pathways. HistoPrism not only surpasses prior state-of-the-art models on highly variable genes , but also more importantly, achieves substantial gains on pathway-level prediction, demonstrating its ability to recover biologically coherent transcriptomic patterns. With strong pan-cancer generalization and improved efficiency, HistoPrism establishes a new standard for clinically relevant transcriptomic modeling from routinely available histology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21560v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TabClustPFN: A Prior-Fitted Network for Tabular Data Clustering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21656</link><description>arXiv:2601.21656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering tabular data is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to heterogeneous feature types, diverse data-generating mechanisms, and the absence of transferable inductive biases across datasets. Prior-fitted networks (PFNs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization in supervised tabular learning by amortizing Bayesian inference under a broad synthetic prior. Extending this paradigm to clustering is nontrivial: clustering is unsupervised, admits a combinatorial and permutation-invariant output space, and requires inferring the number of clusters. We introduce TabClustPFN, a prior-fitted network for tabular data clustering that performs amortized Bayesian inference over both cluster assignments and cluster cardinality. Pretrained on synthetic datasets drawn from a flexible clustering prior, TabClustPFN clusters unseen datasets in a single forward pass, without dataset-specific retraining or hyperparameter tuning. The model naturally handles heterogeneous numerical and categorical features and adapts to a wide range of clustering structures. Experiments on synthetic data and curated real-world tabular benchmarks show that TabClustPFN outperforms classical, deep, and amortized clustering baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness in out-of-the-box exploratory settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21700v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SmartMeterFM: Unifying Smart Meter Data Generative Tasks Using Flow Matching Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21706</link><description>arXiv:2601.21706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart meter data is the foundation for planning and operating the distribution network. Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21706v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mixed-Precision Training and Compilation for RRAM-based Computing-in-Memory Accelerators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21737</link><description>arXiv:2601.21737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) accelerators are a promising solution for accelerating Machine Learning (ML) workloads, as they perform Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs) on crossbar arrays directly in memory. Although the bit widths of the crossbar inputs and cells are very limited, most CIM compilers do not support quantization below 8 bit. As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy. In the best case, our approach achieves up to a 2.48x speedup over existing state-of-the-art solutions, with an accuracy loss of only 0.086 %.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21737v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoFrGeNet: Continued Fraction Architectures for Language Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21766</link><description>arXiv:2601.21766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers are arguably the preferred architecture for language generation. In this paper, inspired by continued fractions, we introduce a new function class for generative modeling. The architecture family implementing this function class is named CoFrGeNets - Continued Fraction Generative Networks. We design novel architectural components based on this function class that can replace Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer blocks while requiring much fewer parameters. We derive custom gradient formulations to optimize the proposed components more accurately and efficiently than using standard PyTorch-based gradients. Our components are a plug-in replacement requiring little change in training or inference procedures that have already been put in place for Transformer-based models thus making our approach easy to incorporate in large industrial workflows. We experiment on two very different transformer architectures GPT2-xl (1.5B) and Llama3 (3.2B), where the former we pre-train on OpenWebText and GneissWeb, while the latter we pre-train on the docling data mix which consists of nine different datasets. Results show that the performance on downstream classification, Q\&amp; A, reasoning and text understanding tasks of our models is competitive and sometimes even superior to the original models with $\frac{2}{3}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ the parameters and shorter pre-training time. We believe that future implementations customized to hardware will further bring out the true potential of our architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21766v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Effective LoRA Adapter Routing using Task Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21795</link><description>arXiv:2601.21795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter efficient specialization of large language models (LLMs) through modular adapters, resulting in rapidly growing public adapter pools spanning diverse tasks. Effectively using these adapters requires routing: selecting and composing the appropriate adapters for a query. We introduce LORAUTER, a novel routing framework that selects and composes LoRA adapters using task representations rather than adapter characteristics. Unlike existing approaches that map queries directly to adapters, LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets and does not require adapter training data. By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21795v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Moral Outrage Shapes Commitments Beyond Attention: Multimodal Moral Emotions on YouTube in Korea and the US</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21815</link><description>arXiv:2601.21815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how media rhetoric shapes audience engagement is crucial in the attention economy. This study examines how moral emotional framing by mainstream news channels on YouTube influences user behavior across Korea and the United States. To capture the platform's multimodal nature, combining thumbnail images and video titles, we develop a multimodal moral emotion classifier by fine tuning a vision language model. The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting. These findings suggest that moral outrage is a particularly effective emotional strategy, attracting not only attention but also active participation. We discuss concerns about the potential misuse of other condemning rhetoric, as such practices may deepen polarization by reinforcing in group and out group divisions. To facilitate future research and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21815v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal Software Pipelining using an SMT-Solver</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21842</link><description>arXiv:2601.21842v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21937v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Tokens to Blocks: A Block-Diffusion Perspective on Molecular Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21964</link><description>arXiv:2601.21964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drug discovery can be viewed as a combinatorial search over an immense chemical space, motivating the development of deep generative models for de novo molecular design. Among these, GPT-based molecular language models (MLM) have shown strong molecular design performance by learning chemical syntax and semantics from large-scale data. However, existing MLMs face two fundamental limitations: they inadequately capture the graph-structured nature of molecules when formulated as next-token prediction problems, and they typically lack explicit mechanisms for target-aware generation. Here, we propose SoftMol, a unified framework that co-designs molecular representation, model architecture, and search strategy for target-aware molecular generation. SoftMol introduces soft fragments, a rule-free block representation of SMILES that enables diffusion-native modeling, and develops SoftBD, the first block-diffusion molecular language model that combines local bidirectional diffusion with autoregressive generation under molecular structural constraints. To favor generated molecules with high drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, SoftBD is trained on a carefully curated dataset named ZINC-Curated. SoftMol further integrates a gated Monte Carlo tree search to assemble fragments in a target-aware manner. Experimental results show that, compared with current state-of-the-art models, SoftMol achieves 100% chemical validity, improves binding affinity by 9.7%, yields a 2-3x increase in molecular diversity, and delivers a 6.6x speedup in inference efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating content inconsistent with the input. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can mitigate hallucinations but require resource-intensive retrieval or large-scale fine-tuning. Decoding-based methods are lighter yet lack explicit hallucination control. To address this, we present Token-Guard, a token-level hallucination control method based on self-checking decoding. Token-Guard performs internal verification at each reasoning step to detect hallucinated tokens before they propagate. Candidate fragments are further evaluated in a latent space with explicit hallucination risk scoring, while iterative pruning and regeneration dynamically correct detected errors. Experiments on HALU datasets show Token-Guard substantially reduces hallucinations and improves generation accuracy, offering a scalable, modular solution for reliable LLM outputs.

Abstract: Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology. SPICE simulations confirm average absolute efficiency gains of 10% across 8 modes and up to 17% at a single mode.

Abstract: Streaming reconstruction from monocular image sequences remains challenging, as existing methods typically favor either high-quality rendering or accurate geometry, but rarely both. We present PLANING, an efficient on-the-fly reconstruction framework built on a hybrid representation that loosely couples explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians, enabling geometry and appearance to be modeled in a decoupled manner. This decoupling supports an online initialization and optimization strategy that separates geometry and appearance updates, yielding stable streaming reconstruction with substantially reduced structural redundancy. PLANING improves dense mesh Chamfer-L2 by 18.52% over PGSR, surpasses ARTDECO by 1.31 dB PSNR, and reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, over 5x faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching the quality of offline per-scene optimization. Beyond reconstruction quality, the structural clarity and computational efficiency of PLANING make it well suited for a broad range of downstream applications, such as enabling large-scale scene modeling and simulation-ready environments for embodied AI.

Abstract: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22076v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Hamiltonian Flow Maps: Mean Flow Consistency for Large-Timestep Molecular Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22123</link><description>arXiv:2601.22123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22123v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Iterative execution of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms with applications for signal denoising via sparsification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09284</link><description>arXiv:2211.09284v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a family of iterative algorithms that involve the repeated execution of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms. One interesting member of this family is motivated by the discrete Fourier transform uncertainty principle and involves the application of a sparsification operation to both the real domain and frequency domain data with convergence obtained when real domain sparsity hits a stable pattern. This sparsification variant has practical utility for signal denoising, in particular the recovery of a periodic spike signal in the presence of Gaussian noise. General convergence properties and denoising performance relative to existing methods are demonstrated using simulation studies.

Abstract: Generating accurate extremes from an observational data set is crucial when seeking to estimate risks associated with the occurrence of future extremes which could be larger than those already observed. Applications range from the occurrence of natural disasters to financial crashes. Generative approaches from the machine learning community do not apply to extreme samples without careful adaptation. Besides, asymptotic results from extreme value theory (EVT) give a theoretical framework to model multivariate extreme events, especially through the notion of multivariate regular variation. Bridging these two fields, this paper details a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach for sampling multivariate heavy-tailed distributions, i.e., distributions likely to have extremes of particularly large intensities. We illustrate the relevance of our approach on a synthetic data set and on a real data set of discharge measurements along the Danube river network. The latter shows the potential of our approach for flood risks' assessment. In addition to outperforming the standard VAE for the tested data sets, we also provide a comparison with a competing EVT-based generative approach. On the tested cases, our approach improves the learning of the dependency structure between extremes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2306.10987v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Frank--Wolfe algorithms for piecewise star-convex functions with a nonsmooth difference-of-convex structure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16444</link><description>arXiv:2308.16444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we formulate two versions of Frank--Wolfe algorithm or conditional gradient method to solve the DC optimization problem with an adaptive step size. The DC objective function consists of two components; the first is thought to be differentiable with a continuous Lipschitz gradient, while the second is only thought to be convex. The second version is based on the first and employs finite differences to approximate the gradient of the first component of the objective function. In contrast to past formulations that used the curvature/Lipschitz-type constant of the objective function, the step size computed does not require any constant associated with the components. For the first version, we established that the algorithm is well-defined of the algorithm and that every limit point of the generated sequence is a stationary point of the problem. We also introduce the class of weak-star-convex functions and show that, despite the fact that these functions are non-convex in general, the rate of convergence of the first version of the algorithm to minimize these functions is ${\cal O}(1/k)$. The finite difference used to approximate the gradient in the second version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is computed with the step-size adaptively updated using two previous iterations. Unlike previous applications of finite difference in the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which provided approximate gradients with absolute error, the one used here provides us with a relative error, simplifying the algorithm analysis. In this case, we show that all limit points of the generated sequence for the second version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm are stationary points for the problem under consideration, and we establish that the rate of convergence for the duality gap is ${\cal O}(1/\sqrt{k})$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2308.16444v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative quantum machine learning via denoising diffusion probabilistic models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05866</link><description>arXiv:2310.05866v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models are key-enabling technology to computer vision, text generation, and large language models. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently gained much attention due to their ability to generate diverse and high-quality samples in many computer vision tasks, as well as to incorporate flexible model architectures and a relatively simple training scheme. Quantum generative models, empowered by entanglement and superposition, have brought new insight to learning classical and quantum data. Inspired by the classical counterpart, we propose the quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM) to enable efficiently trainable generative learning of quantum data. QuDDPM adopts sufficient layers of circuits to guarantee expressivity, while it introduces multiple intermediate training tasks as interpolation between the target distribution and noise to avoid barren plateau and guarantee efficient training. We provide bounds on the learning error and demonstrate QuDDPM's capability in learning correlated quantum noise model, quantum many-body phases, and topological structure of quantum data. The results provide a paradigm for versatile and efficient quantum generative learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2310.05866v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum speedups for linear programming via interior point methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03215</link><description>arXiv:2311.03215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a quantum algorithm based on an interior point method for solving a linear program with $n$ inequality constraints on $d$ variables. The algorithm explicitly returns a feasible solution that is $\varepsilon$-close to optimal, and runs in time $\sqrt{n} \cdot \mathrm{poly}(d,\log(n),\log(1/\varepsilon))$ which is sublinear for tall linear programs (i.e., $n \gg d$). Our algorithm speeds up the Newton step in the state-of-the-art interior point method of Lee and Sidford [FOCS '14]. This requires us to efficiently approximate the Hessian and gradient of the barrier function, and these are our main contributions.
  To approximate the Hessian, we describe a quantum algorithm for the \emph{spectral approximation} of $A^T A$ for a tall matrix $A \in \mathbb R^{n \times d}$. The algorithm uses leverage score sampling in combination with Grover search, and returns a $\delta$-approximation by making $O(\sqrt{nd}/\delta)$ row queries to $A$. This generalizes an earlier quantum speedup for graph sparsification by Apers and de Wolf [FOCS '20]. To approximate the gradient, we use a recent quantum algorithm for multivariate mean estimation by Cornelissen, Hamoudi and Jerbi [STOC '22]. While a naive implementation introduces a dependence on the condition number of the Hessian, we avoid this by pre-conditioning our random variable using our quantum algorithm for spectral approximation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2311.03215v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multivariate Bayesian Last Layer for Regression with Uncertainty Quantification and Decomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01761</link><description>arXiv:2405.01761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating all minimal transversals (also called minimal hitting sets) of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$. An equivalent formulation of this problem known as the \emph{transversal hypergraph} problem (or \emph{hypergraph dualization} problem) is to decide, given two hypergraphs, whether one corresponds to the set of minimal transversals of the other. The existence of a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem is a long standing open question. In \cite{fredman_complexity_1996}, the authors present the first sub-exponential algorithm to solve the transversal hypergraph problem which runs in quasi-polynomial time, making it unlikely that the problem is (co)NP-complete.
  In this paper, we show that when one of the two hypergraphs is of bounded VC-dimension, the transversal hypergraph problem can be solved in polynomial time, or equivalently that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a hypergraph of bounded VC-dimension, then there exists an incremental polynomial time algorithm to enumerate its minimal transversals. This result generalizes most of the previously known polynomial cases in the literature since they almost all consider classes of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension. As a consequence, the hypergraph transversal problem is solvable in polynomial time for any class of hypergraphs closed under partial subhypergraphs. We also show that the proposed algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time in general hypergraphs and runs in polynomial time if the conformality of the hypergraph is bounded, which is one of the few known polynomial cases where the VC-dimension is unbounded.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.00694v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vision Calorimeter for Anti-neutron Reconstruction: A Baseline</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10599</link><description>arXiv:2408.10599v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, anti-neutrons ($\bar{n}$) are fundamental particles that frequently appear as final-state particles, and the reconstruction of their kinematic properties provides an important probe for understanding the governing principles. However, this confronts significant challenges instrumentally with the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), a typical experimental sensor but recovering the information of incident $\bar{n}$ insufficiently. In this study, we introduce Vision Calorimeter (ViC), a baseline method for anti-neutron reconstruction that leverages deep learning detectors to analyze the implicit relationships between EMC responses and incident $\bar{n}$ characteristics. Our motivation lies in that energy distributions of $\bar{n}$ samples deposited in the EMC cell arrays embody rich contextual information. Converted to 2-D images, such contextual energy distributions can be used to predict the status of $\bar{n}$ ($i.e.$, incident position and momentum) through a deep learning detector along with pseudo bounding boxes and a specified training objective. Experimental results demonstrate that ViC substantially outperforms the conventional reconstruction approach, reducing the prediction error of incident position by 42.81% (from 17.31$^{\circ}$ to 9.90$^{\circ}$). More importantly, this study for the first time realizes the measurement of incident $\bar{n}$ momentum, underscoring the potential of deep learning detectors for particle reconstruction.

Abstract: Many spatial models exhibit locality structures that effectively reduce their intrinsic dimensionality, enabling efficient approximation and sampling of high-dimensional distributions. However, existing approximation techniques primarily focus on joint distributions and do not provide precise accuracy control for low-dimensional marginals, which are of primary interest in many practical scenarios. By leveraging the locality structures, we establish a dimension independent uniform error bound for the marginals of approximate distributions. Inspired by the Stein's method, we introduce a novel $\delta$-locality condition that quantifies the locality in distributions, and link it to the structural assumptions such as the sparse graphical models. The theoretical guarantee motivates the localization of existing sampling methods, as we illustrate through the localized likelihood-informed subspace method and localized score matching. We show that by leveraging the locality structure, these methods greatly reduce the sample complexity and computational cost via localized and parallel implementations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.11771v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15982</link><description>arXiv:2410.15982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) was recently proposed for state estimation in dynamical systems when only a sparse subset of the state variables can be observed. The S-DEIM estimate involves a kernel vector whose optimal value is inferred through a data assimilation algorithm. This data assimilation step suffers from two drawbacks: (i) It requires the knowledge of the governing equations of the dynamical system, and (ii) It is not generally guaranteed to converge to the optimal kernel vector. To address these issues, here we introduce an equation-free S-DEIM framework that estimates the optimal kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We show that the recurrent architecture is necessary since the kernel vector cannot be estimated from instantaneous observations. But RNNs, which incorporate the past history of the observations in the learning process, lead to nearly optimal estimations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on three numerical examples with increasing degree of spatiotemporal complexity: a conceptual model of atmospheric flow known as the Lorenz-96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Rayleigh-Benard convection. In each case, the resulting S-DEIM estimates are satisfactory even when a relatively simple RNN architecture, namely the reservoir computing network, is used. More specifically, our RNN-based S-DEIM state estimations reduce the relative error between 42% and 58% when compared to Q-DEIM which ignores the kernel vector by setting it equal to zero.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.15982v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On uniqueness in structured model learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22009</link><description>arXiv:2410.22009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of uniqueness in learning physical laws for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Contrary to most existing approaches, it considers a framework of structured model learning, where existing, approximately correct physical models are augmented with components that are learned from data. The main results of the paper are a uniqueness and a convergence result that cover a large class of PDEs and a suitable class of neural networks used for approximating the unknown model components. The uniqueness result shows that, in the limit of full, noiseless measurements, a unique identification of the unknown model components as functions is possible as classical regularization-minimizing solutions of the PDE system. This result is complemented by a convergence result showing that model components learned as parameterized neural networks from incomplete, noisy measurements approximate the regularization-minimizing solutions of the PDE system in the limit. These results are possible under specific properties of the approximating neural networks and due to a dedicated choice of regularization. With this, a practical contribution of this analytic paper is to provide a class of model learning frameworks different to standard settings where uniqueness can be expected in the limit of full measurements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.22009v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The effect of priors on Learning with Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02623</link><description>arXiv:2412.02623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are generative models designed to learn from data with a rich underlying structure. In this work, we explore a teacher-student setting where a student RBM learns from examples generated by a teacher RBM, with a focus on the effect of the unit priors on learning efficiency. We consider a parametric class of priors that interpolate between continuous (Gaussian) and binary variables. This approach models various possible choices of visible units, hidden units, and weights for both the teacher and student RBMs.
  By analyzing the phase diagram of the posterior distribution in both the Bayes optimal and mismatched regimes, we demonstrate the existence of a triple point that defines the critical dataset size necessary for learning through generalization. The critical size is strongly influenced by the properties of the teacher, and thus the data, but is unaffected by the properties of the student RBM. Nevertheless, a prudent choice of student priors can facilitate training by expanding the so-called signal retrieval region, where the machine generalizes effectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.02623v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Well-Posedness of the Linear Regularized 13-Moment Equations Using Tensor-Valued Korn Inequalities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14108</link><description>arXiv:2501.14108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we finally prove the well-posedness of the linearized R13 moment model, which describes, e.g., rarefied gas flows. As an extension of the classical fluid equations, moment models are robust and have been frequently used, yet they are challenging to analyze due to their additional equations. By effectively grouping variables, we identify a 2-by-2 block structure, allowing us to analyze well-posedness within the abstract LBB framework for saddle point problems. Due to the unique tensorial structure of the equations, in addition to an interesting combination of tools from Stokes' and linear elasticity theory, we also need new coercivity estimates for tensor fields. These Korn-type inequalities are established by analyzing the symbol map of the symmetric and trace-free part of tensor derivative fields. Together with the corresponding right inverse of the tensorial divergence, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. This result also serves as the basis for future numerical analysis of corresponding discretization schemes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.14108v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evidence for Phenotype-Driven Disparities in Freezing of Gait Detection and Approaches to Bias Mitigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09626</link><description>arXiv:2502.09626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and a common cause of injurious falls. Recent advances in wearable-based human activity recognition (HAR) enable FOG detection, but bias and fairness in these models remain understudied. Bias refers to systematic errors leading to unequal outcomes, while fairness refers to consistent performance across subject groups. Biased models could systematically underserve patients with specific FOG phenotypes or demographics, potentially widening care disparities. We systematically evaluated bias and fairness of state-of-the-art HAR models for FOG detection across phenotypes and demographics using multi-site datasets. We assessed four mitigation approaches: conventional methods (threshold optimization and adversarial debiasing) and transfer learning approaches (multi-site transfer and fine-tuning large pretrained models). Fairness was quantified using demographic parity ratio (DPR) and equalized odds ratio (EOR). HAR models exhibited substantial bias (DPR &amp; EOR &lt; 0.8) across age, sex, disease duration, and critically, FOG phenotype. Phenotype-specific bias is particularly concerning as tremulous and akinetic FOG require different clinical management. Conventional bias mitigation methods failed: threshold optimization (DPR=-0.126, EOR=+0.063) and adversarial debiasing (DPR=-0.008, EOR=-0.001) showed minimal improvement. In contrast, transfer learning from multi-site datasets significantly improved fairness (DPR=+0.037, p&lt;0.01; EOR=+0.045, p&lt;0.01) and performance (F1-score=+0.020, p&lt;0.05). Transfer learning across diverse datasets is essential for developing equitable HAR models that reliably detect FOG across all patient phenotypes, ensuring wearable-based monitoring benefits all individuals with PD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.09626v2</guid></item></channel></rss>
