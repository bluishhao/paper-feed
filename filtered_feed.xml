Abstract: ECG-Language Models (ELMs) extend recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to automated ECG interpretation. However, most ELMs follow Vision-Language Model (VLM) designs and depend on pretrained ECG encoders, adding architectural and training complexity. Inspired by encoder-free VLMs, we introduce ELF, an encoder-free ELM that replaces the ECG encoder with a single projection layer trained jointly with the LLM. Across five datasets, ELF matches or exceeds state-of-the-art ELMs that use far more complex encoders and training pipelines. We also test whether adding architectural biases to ELF improves performance and find that the single linear projection remains competitive. Finally, we show that ELF, and potentially other ELMs, often rely more on benchmark artifacts and language priors than ECG-derived information, highlighting limitations in current evaluation practices and ELM design. All data and code is available at https://github.com/willxxy/ECG-Bench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18798v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Digital Twins: A Taxonomy of Capabilities for Understanding Possible Futures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18799</link><description>arXiv:2601.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As digital twins (DTs) evolve to become more agentic through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), they acquire capabilities that extend beyond dynamic representation of their target systems. This paper presents a taxonomy of agentic DTs organised around three fundamental dimensions: the locus of agency (external, internal, distributed), the tightness of coupling (loose, tight, constitutive), and model evolution (static, adaptive, reconstructive). From the resulting 27-configuration space, we identify nine illustrative configurations grouped into three clusters: "The Present" (existing tools and emerging steering systems), "The Threshold" (where emergent properties appear and coupling becomes constitutive), and "The Frontier" (where systems gain reconstructive capabilities).
  Our analysis explores how agentic DTs exercise performative power--not merely representing physical systems but actively participating in constituting them. Using traffic navigation systems as examples, we show how even passive tools can exhibit emergent performativity, while advanced configurations risk performative lock-in. Drawing on performative prediction theory, we trace a progression from passive tools through active steering to ontological reconstruction, examining how constitutive coupling enables systems to create self-validating realities. Understanding these configurations is essential for navigating the transformation from DTs as mirror worlds to DTs as architects of new ontologies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18799v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-Powered Augmented Reality as a Threat Vector for Human Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18802</link><description>arXiv:2601.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) is a powerful perceptual technology that can alter what users see, hear, feel, and experience throughout their daily lives. When combined with the speed and flexibility of context-aware generative AI, the power is greatly expanded, allowing individual users to be targeted with custom-generated AR experiences that are instantly tailored to who they are, where they are, and what they are doing. This can transform the physical world into a magical place, but only if the augmentation of a user's environment is enacted for their personal benefit and best interests. Instead, if AI-powered AR systems are controlled by unregulated third parties, such as large corporations or state actors, individually adaptive AR experiences could be deployed as a dangerous form of targeted influence. In fact, if the industry adopts an advertising business model for AI-powered AR devices, context-aware generative influence could become a widely used manipulative path for promotion of products and services in the physical world. Worse, similar techniques could be used for political influence, propaganda, and disinformation. This chapter reviews the power and flexibility of AI-generated augmented reality, explores the risks that emerge when used for persuasion, manipulation, or influence, and proposes policy directions to mitigate these risks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18802v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Latent Structural Similarity Networks for Unsupervised Discovery in Multivariate Time Series</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18803</link><description>arXiv:2601.18803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a task-agnostic discovery layer for multivariate time series that constructs a relational hypothesis graph over entities without assuming linearity, stationarity, or a downstream objective. The method learns window-level sequence representations using an unsupervised sequence-to-sequence autoencoder, aggregates these representations into entity-level embeddings, and induces a sparse similarity network by thresholding a latent-space similarity measure. This network is intended as an analyzable abstraction that compresses the pairwise search space and exposes candidate relationships for further investigation, rather than as a model optimized for prediction, trading, or any decision rule. The framework is demonstrated on a challenging real-world dataset of hourly cryptocurrency returns, illustrating how latent similarity induces coherent network structure; a classical econometric relation is also reported as an external diagnostic lens to contextualize discovered edges.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18803v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Hybrid Discretize-then-Project Reduced Order Model for Turbulent Flows on Collocated Grids with Data-Driven Closure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18817</link><description>arXiv:2601.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for turbulent incompressible flows on collocated finite volume grids. The methodology employs the "discretize-then-project" consistent flux strategy, which ensures mass conservation and pressure-velocity coupling without requiring auxiliary stabilization like boundary control or pressure stabilization techniques. However, because standard Galerkin projection fails to yield physically consistent results for the turbulent viscosity field, a hybrid strategy is adopted: velocity and pressure are resolved via intrusive projection, while the turbulent viscosity is reconstructed using a non-intrusive data-driven closure. We evaluate three neural network architectures, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Transformers, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to model the temporal evolution of the viscosity coefficients. Validated against a 3D Large Eddy Simulation of a lid-driven cavity, the LSTM-based closure demonstrates superior performance in capturing transient dynamics, achieving relative errors of 0.7\% for velocity and 4\% for turbulent viscosity. The resulting framework effectively combines the mathematical rigor of the consistent flux formulation with the adaptability of deep learning for turbulence modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18817v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VAE with Hyperspherical Coordinates: Improving Anomaly Detection from Hypervolume-Compressed Latent Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18823</link><description>arXiv:2601.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and OOD modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18823v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differential Voting: Loss Functions For Axiomatically Diverse Aggregation of Heterogeneous Preferences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18824</link><description>arXiv:2601.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) implicitly aggregates heterogeneous human preferences into a single utility function, even though the underlying utilities of the participants are in practice diverse. Hence, RLHF can be viewed as a form of voting, where the aggregation mechanism is defined by the loss function. Although Arrow's Impossibility Theorem suggests that different mechanisms satisfy different sets of desirable axioms, most existing methods rely on a single aggregation principle, typically the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, which corresponds to Borda count voting. This restricts the axiomatic properties of the learned reward and obscures the normative assumptions embedded in optimization. In this work, we introduce Differential Voting, a unifying framework that constructs instance-wise, differentiable loss functions whose population-level optima provably correspond to distinct classical voting rules. We develop differentiable surrogates for majority-based aggregation (BTL), Copeland, and Kemeny rules, and formally analyze their calibration properties, gradient fields, and limiting behavior as smoothing parameters vanish. For each loss, we establish consistency with the corresponding social choice rule and characterize the axioms it satisfies or violates. Our analysis shows how design choices in loss geometry-such as margin sensitivity and boundary concentration-directly translate into normative aggregation behavior. Differential Voting makes preference aggregation an explicit and controllable design choice in RLHF, enabling principled trade-offs between axiomatic guarantees and optimization stability. Code to reproduce our experiments is open-sourced.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18824v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated structural testing of LLM-based agents: methods, framework, and case studies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18827</link><description>arXiv:2601.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are rapidly being adopted across diverse domains. Since they interact with users without supervision, they must be tested extensively. Current testing approaches focus on acceptance-level evaluation from the user's perspective. While intuitive, these tests require manual evaluation, are difficult to automate, do not facilitate root cause analysis, and incur expensive test environments. In this paper, we present methods to enable structural testing of LLM-based agents. Our approach utilizes traces (based on OpenTelemetry) to capture agent trajectories, employs mocking to enforce reproducible LLM behavior, and adds assertions to automate test verification. This enables testing agent components and interactions at a deeper technical level within automated workflows. We demonstrate how structural testing enables the adaptation of software engineering best practices to agents, including the test automation pyramid, regression testing, test-driven development, and multi-language testing. In representative case studies, we demonstrate automated execution and faster root-cause analysis. Collectively, these methods reduce testing costs and improve agent quality through higher coverage, reusability, and earlier defect detection. We provide an open source reference implementation on GitHub.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IPBC: An Interactive Projection-Based Framework for Human-in-the-Loop Semi-Supervised Clustering of High-Dimensional Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18828</link><description>arXiv:2601.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common across scientific and industrial domains, yet they remain difficult to cluster effectively due to the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics and the tendency of clusters to collapse or overlap when projected into lower dimensions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18828v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Much Temporal Modeling is Enough? A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18830</link><description>arXiv:2601.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18830v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Geometric Reasoner: Manifold-Informed Latent Foresight Search for Long-Context Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18832</link><description>arXiv:2601.18832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling test-time compute enhances long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between computational cost and coverage quality: either incurring high training expense or yielding redundant trajectories. We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18832v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Business Process Management Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18833</link><description>arXiv:2601.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the early 90s, the evolution of the Business Process Management (BPM) discipline has been punctuated by successive waves of automation technologies. Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18833v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CanaryBench: Stress Testing Privacy Leakage in Cluster-Level Conversation Summaries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18834</link><description>arXiv:2601.18834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregate analytics over conversational data are increasingly used for safety monitoring, governance, and product analysis in large language model systems. A common practice is to embed conversations, cluster them, and publish short textual summaries describing each cluster. While raw conversations may never be exposed, these derived summaries can still pose privacy risks if they contain personally identifying information (PII) or uniquely traceable strings copied from individual conversations.
  We introduce CanaryBench, a simple and reproducible stress test for privacy leakage in cluster-level conversation summaries. CanaryBench generates synthetic conversations with planted secret strings ("canaries") that simulate sensitive identifiers. Because canaries are known a priori, any appearance of these strings in published summaries constitutes a measurable leak.
  Using TF-IDF embeddings and k-means clustering on 3,000 synthetic conversations (24 topics) with a canary injection rate of 0.60, we evaluate an intentionally extractive example snippet summarizer that models quote-like reporting. In this configuration, we observe canary leakage in 50 of 52 canary-containing clusters (cluster-level leakage rate 0.961538), along with nonzero regex-based PII indicator counts. A minimal defense combining a minimum cluster-size publication threshold (k-min = 25) and regex-based redaction eliminates measured canary leakage and PII indicator hits in the reported run while maintaining a similar cluster-coherence proxy. We position this work as a societal impacts contribution centered on privacy risk measurement for published analytics artifacts rather than raw user data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18834v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Time series forecasting with Hahn Kolmogorov-Arnold networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18837</link><description>arXiv:2601.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Transformer- and MLP-based models have demonstrated strong performance in long-term time series forecasting, yet Transformers remain limited by their quadratic complexity and permutation-equivariant attention, while MLPs exhibit spectral bias. We propose HaKAN, a versatile model based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), leveraging Hahn polynomial-based learnable activation functions and providing a lightweight and interpretable alternative for multivariate time series forecasting. Our model integrates channel independence, patching, a stack of Hahn-KAN blocks with residual connections, and a bottleneck structure comprised of two fully connected layers. The Hahn-KAN block consists of inter- and intra-patch KAN layers to effectively capture both global and local temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on various forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its core components.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18837v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analysis of Control Bellman Residual Minimization for Markov Decision Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18840</link><description>arXiv:2601.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18840v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GUIGuard: Toward a General Framework for Privacy-Preserving GUI Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18842</link><description>arXiv:2601.18842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GUI agents enable end-to-end automation through direct perception of and interaction with on-screen interfaces. However, these agents frequently access interfaces containing sensitive personal information, and screenshots are often transmitted to remote models, creating substantial privacy risks. These risks are particularly severe in GUI workflows: GUIs expose richer, more accessible private information, and privacy risks depend on interaction trajectories across sequential scenes. We propose GUIGuard, a three-stage framework for privacy-preserving GUI agents: (1) privacy recognition, (2) privacy protection, and (3) task execution under protection. We further construct GUIGuard-Bench, a cross-platform benchmark with 630 trajectories and 13,830 screenshots, annotated with region-level privacy grounding and fine-grained labels of risk level, privacy category, and task necessity. Evaluations reveal that existing agents exhibit limited privacy recognition, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 13.3% accuracy on Android and 1.4% on PC. Under privacy protection, task-planning semantics can still be maintained, with closed-source models showing stronger semantic consistency than open-source ones. Case studies on MobileWorld show that carefully designed protection strategies achieve higher task accuracy while preserving privacy. Our results highlight privacy recognition as a critical bottleneck for practical GUI agents.

Abstract: Static analysis tools (SATs) are widely adopted in both academia and industry for improving software quality, yet their practical use is often hindered by high false positive rates, especially in large-scale enterprise systems. These false alarms demand substantial manual inspection, creating severe inefficiencies in industrial code review. While recent work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for false alarm reduction on open-source benchmarks, their effectiveness in real-world enterprise settings remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of diverse LLM-based false alarm reduction techniques in an industrial context at Tencent, one of the largest IT companies in China. Using data from Tencent's enterprise-customized SAT on its large-scale Advertising and Marketing Services software, we construct a dataset of 433 alarms (328 false positives, 105 true positives) covering three common bug types. Through interviewing developers and analyzing the data, our results highlight the prevalence of false positives, which wastes substantial manual effort (e.g., 10-20 minutes of manual inspection per alarm). Meanwhile, our results show the huge potential of LLMs for reducing false alarms in industrial settings (e.g., hybrid techniques of LLM and static analysis eliminate 94-98% of false positives with high recall). Furthermore, LLM-based techniques are cost-effective, with per-alarm costs as low as 2.1-109.5 seconds and $0.0011-$0.12, representing orders-of-magnitude savings compared to manual review. Finally, our case analysis further identifies key limitations of LLM-based false alarm reduction in industrial settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18844v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Mask-Based Backdoor Attack Against Vision AI Models: A Case Study on Mushroom Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18845</link><description>arXiv:2601.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized numerous tasks within the computer vision field, including image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. However, the increasing deployment of deep learning models has exposed them to various adversarial attacks, including backdoor attacks. This paper presents a novel dynamic mask-based backdoor attack method, specifically designed for object detection models. We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples. Our approach surpasses traditional methods for backdoor injection, which are based on static and consistent patterns. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect deep learning models from these evolving adversarial threats.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM Driven Design of Continuous Optimization Problems with Controllable High-level Properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18846</link><description>arXiv:2601.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18846v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MulVul: Retrieval-augmented Multi-Agent Code Vulnerability Detection via Cross-Model Prompt Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18847</link><description>arXiv:2601.18847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to automate real-world vulnerability detection due to two key limitations: the heterogeneity of vulnerability patterns undermines the effectiveness of a single unified model, and manual prompt engineering for massive weakness categories is unscalable.
  To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MulVul}, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for precise and broad-coverage vulnerability detection. MulVul adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy: a \emph{Router} agent first predicts the top-$k$ coarse categories and then forwards the input to specialized \emph{Detector} agents, which identify the exact vulnerability types. Both agents are equipped with retrieval tools to actively source evidence from vulnerability knowledge bases to mitigate hallucinations.
  Crucially, to automate the generation of specialized prompts, we design \emph{Cross-Model Prompt Evolution}, a prompt optimization mechanism where a generator LLM iteratively refines candidate prompts while a distinct executor LLM validates their effectiveness. This decoupling mitigates the self-correction bias inherent in single-model optimization.
  Evaluated on 130 CWE types, MulVul achieves 34.79\% Macro-F1, outperforming the best baseline by 41.5\%. Ablation studies validate cross-model prompt evolution, which boosts performance by 51.6\% over manual prompts by effectively handling diverse vulnerability patterns.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18847v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation with Blink Embedding and Hash Grid Landmarks Encoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18849</link><description>arXiv:2601.18849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated considerable success in generating high-fidelity 3D models of talking portraits. Despite significant advancements in the rendering speed and generation quality, challenges persist in accurately and efficiently capturing mouth movements in talking portraits. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic method based on blink embedding and hash grid landmarks encoding in this study, which can substantially enhance the fidelity of talking faces. Specifically, we leverage facial features encoded as conditional features and integrate audio features as residual terms into our model through a Dynamic Landmark Transformer. Furthermore, we employ neural radiance fields to model the entire face, resulting in a lifelike face representation. Experimental evaluations have validated the superiority of our approach to existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Safety-Compliant Transformer Architectures for Automotive Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18850</link><description>arXiv:2601.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have shown remarkable performance in vision and language tasks but pose unique challenges for safety-critical applications. This paper presents a conceptual framework for integrating Transformers into automotive systems from a safety perspective. We outline how multimodal Foundation Models can leverage sensor diversity and redundancy to improve fault tolerance and robustness. Our proposed architecture combines multiple independent modality-specific encoders that fuse their representations into a shared latent space, supporting fail-operational behavior if one modality degrades. We demonstrate how different input modalities could be fused in order to maintain consistent scene understanding. By structurally embedding redundancy and diversity at the representational level, this approach bridges the gap between modern deep learning and established functional safety practices, paving the way for certifiable AI systems in autonomous driving.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18850v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SelfieAvatar: Real-time Head Avatar reenactment from a Selfie Video</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18851</link><description>arXiv:2601.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Head avatar reenactment focuses on creating animatable personal avatars from monocular videos, serving as a foundational element for applications like social signal understanding, gaming, human-machine interaction, and computer vision. Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on self-reenactment and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior head avatar reconstruction with rich and intricate textures compared to existing approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18851v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Representational Homomorphism Predicts and Improves Compositional Generalization In Transformer Language Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18858</link><description>arXiv:2601.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositional generalization-the ability to interpret novel combinations of familiar components-remains a persistent challenge for neural networks. Behavioral evaluations reveal when models fail but offer limited insight into why failures arise at the representational level. We introduce Homomorphism Error (HE), a structural metric that quantifies deviations from approximate homomorphisms between the expression algebra and a model's hidden-state space. We instantiate HE for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks: modifier HE for unary composition and sequence HE for binary composition, measured by learning representation-level operators that predict composed representations from their parts. Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy. Experiment shows that explicitly enforcing low modifier HE during training significantly reduces modifier HE (p = 1.1x10-4) and sequence HE (p = 0.001) and yields a statistically significant improvement in OOD accuracy (p = 0.023). Together, these results indicate the potential of HE to be both a diagnostic and an actionable training signal for improving compositional generalization. Code to reproduce our experiments is open-sourced.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18858v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] XProvence: Zero-Cost Multilingual Context Pruning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18886</link><description>arXiv:2601.18886v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Caribou across the Arctic has declined in recent decades, motivating scalable and accurate monitoring approaches to guide evidence-based conservation actions and policy decisions. Manual interpretation from this imagery is labor-intensive and error-prone, underscoring the need for automatic and reliable detection across varying scenes. Yet, such automatic detection is challenging due to severe background heterogeneity, dominant empty terrain (class imbalance), small or occluded targets, and wide variation in density and scale. To make the detection model (HerdNet) more robust to these challenges, a weakly supervised patch-level pretraining based on a detection network's architecture is proposed. The detection dataset includes five caribou herds distributed across Alaska. By learning from empty vs. non-empty labels in this dataset, the approach produces early weakly supervised knowledge for enhanced detection compared to HerdNet, which is initialized from generic weights. Accordingly, the patch-based pretrain network attained high accuracy on multi-herd imagery (2017) and on an independent year's (2019) test sets (F1: 93.7%/92.6%, respectively), enabling reliable mapping of regions containing animals to facilitate manual counting on large aerial imagery. Transferred to detection, initialization from weakly supervised pretraining yielded consistent gains over ImageNet weights on both positive patches (F1: 92.6%/93.5% vs. 89.3%/88.6%), and full-image counting (F1: 95.5%/93.3% vs. 91.5%/90.4%). Remaining limitations are false positives from animal-like background clutter and false negatives related to low animal density occlusions. Overall, pretraining on coarse labels prior to detection makes it possible to rely on weakly-supervised pretrained weights even when labeled data are limited, achieving results comparable to generic-weight initialization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18891v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explainable Uncertainty Quantification for Wastewater Treatment Energy Prediction via Interval Type-2 Neuro-Fuzzy System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18897</link><description>arXiv:2601.18897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18897v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language Family Matters: Evaluating LLM-Based ASR Across Linguistic Boundaries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18899</link><description>arXiv:2601.18899v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: As generative models continue to evolve, detecting AI-generated images remains a critical challenge. While effective detection methods exist, they often lack formal interpretability and may rely on implicit assumptions about fake content, potentially limiting robustness to distributional shifts. In this work, we introduce a rigorous, statistically grounded framework for fake image detection that focuses on producing a probability score interpretable with respect to the real-image population. Our method leverages the strengths of multiple existing detectors by combining training-free statistics. We compute p-values over a range of test statistics and aggregate them using classical statistical ensembling to assess alignment with the unified real-image distribution. This framework is generic, flexible, and training-free, making it well-suited for robust fake image detection across diverse and evolving settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18900v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Flatter Tokens are More Valuable for Speculative Draft Model Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18902</link><description>arXiv:2601.18902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a key technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference, but it typically requires training a draft model on a large dataset. We approach this problem from a data-centric perspective, finding that not all training samples contribute equally to the SD acceptance rate. Specifically, our theoretical analysis and empirical validation reveals that tokens inducing flatter predictive distributions from the target model are more valuable than those yielding sharply peaked distributions. Based on this insight, we propose flatness, a new metric to quantify this property, and develop the Sample-level-flatness-based Dataset Distillation (SFDD) approach, which filters the training data to retain only the most valuable samples. Experiments on the EAGLE framework demonstrate that SFDD can achieve over 2$\times$ training speedup using only 50% of the data, while keeping the final model's inference speedup within 4% of the full-dataset baseline. This work introduces an effective, data-centric approach that substantially improves the training efficiency for Speculative Decoding.

Abstract: Auditory Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of speech and audio understanding tasks. Nevertheless, they often struggle when applied to low-resource or unfamiliar tasks. In case of labeled in-domain data is scarce or mismatched to the true test distribution, direct fine-tuning can be brittle. In-Context Learning (ICL) provides a training-free, inference-time solution by adapting auditory LLMs through conditioning on a few in-domain demonstrations. In this work, we first show that \emph{Vanilla ICL}, improves zero-shot performance across diverse speech and audio tasks for selected models which suggest this ICL adaptation capability can be generalized to multimodal setting. Building on this, we propose \textbf{Speech In-Context Learning Adaptation Training (SICL-AT)}, a post-training recipe utilizes only high resource speech data intending to strengthen model's in-context learning capability. The enhancement can generalize to audio understanding/reasoning task. Experiments indicate our proposed method consistently outperforms direct fine-tuning in low-resource scenario.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18904v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition using Dynamic Spectral Features and Kalman Smoothing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18908</link><description>arXiv:2601.18908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition systems often use static features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), and Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE). Because of this, they can misclassify emotions when there is acoustic noise in vocal signals. To address this, we added dynamic features using Dynamic Spectral features (Deltas and Delta-Deltas) along with the Kalman Smoothing algorithm. This approach reduces noise and improves emotion classification. Since emotion changes over time, the Kalman Smoothing filter also helped make the classifier outputs more stable. Tests on the RAVDESS dataset showed that this method achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 87\% and reduced misclassification between emotions with similar acoustic features</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18908v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Is Uncertainty Propagated in Knowledge Distillation?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18909</link><description>arXiv:2601.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation transfers behavior from a teacher to a student model, but the process is inherently stochastic: teacher outputs, student training, and student inference can all be random. Collapsing these uncertainties to a single point estimate can distort what is learned. We systematically study how uncertainty propagates through knowledge distillation across three representative model classes--linear regression, feed-forward neural networks, and large language models (LLMs)--and propose simple corrections. We distinguish inter-student uncertainty (variance across independently distilled students) from intra-student uncertainty (variance of a single student's predictive distribution), showing that standard single-response knowledge distillation suppresses intra-student variance while leaving substantial inter-student variability. To address these mismatches, we introduce two variance-aware strategies: averaging multiple teacher responses, which reduces noise at rate $O(1/k)$, and variance-weighting, which combines teacher and student estimates via inverse-variance weighting to yield a minimum-variance estimator. We provide formal guarantees in linear regression, validate the methods in neural networks, and demonstrate empirical gains in LLM distillation, including reduced systematic noise and hallucination. These results reframe knowledge distillation as an uncertainty transformation and show that variance-aware distillation produces more stable students that better reflect teacher uncertainty.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18909v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ASEHybrid: When Geometry Matters Beyond Homophily in Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18912</link><description>arXiv:2601.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle on graphs with low homophily, yet homophily alone does not explain this behavior, as graphs with similar homophily levels can exhibit markedly different performance and some heterophilous graphs remain easy for vanilla GCNs. Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18912v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning the Pareto Space of Multi-Objective Autonomous Driving: A Modular, Data-Driven Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18913</link><description>arXiv:2601.18913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing safety, efficiency, and interaction is fundamental to designing autonomous driving agents and to understanding autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior in real-world operation. This study introduces an empirical learning framework that derives these trade-offs directly from naturalistic trajectory data. A unified objective space represents each AV timestep through composite scores of safety, efficiency, and interaction. Pareto dominance is applied to identify non-dominated states, forming an empirical frontier that defines the attainable region of balanced performance.
  The proposed framework was demonstrated using the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) datasets from Foggy Bottom and I-395. Results showed that only 0.23\% of AV driving instances were Pareto-optimal, underscoring the rarity of simultaneous optimization across objectives. Pareto-optimal states showed notably higher mean scores for safety, efficiency, and interaction compared to non-optimal cases, with interaction showing the greatest potential for improvement.

Abstract: A wide range of graph learning tasks, such as structure discovery, temporal graph analysis, and combinatorial optimization, focus on inferring graph structures from data, rather than making predictions on given graphs. However, the respective methods to solve such problems are often developed in an isolated, task-specific manner and thus lack a unifying theoretical foundation. Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them. Overall, our unifying perspective bridges seemingly disparate applications and provides a principled approach to structural learning in constrained and combinatorial settings while encouraging cross-pollination of existing methods across graph inverse problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18917v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One Global Model, Many Behaviors: Stockout-Aware Feature Engineering and Dynamic Scaling for Multi-Horizon Retail Demand Forecasting with a Cost-Aware Ordering Policy (VN2 Winner Report)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18919</link><description>arXiv:2601.18919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy. Although developed for the VN2 setting, the proposed approach can be extended to real-world applications and additional operational constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18919v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Belief-Combining Framework for Multi-Trace Reconstruction over Channels with Insertions, Deletions, and Substitutions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18920</link><description>arXiv:2601.18920v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The integration of large-scale chemical databases represents a critical bottleneck in modern cheminformatics research, particularly for machine learning applications requiring high-quality, multi-source validated datasets. This paper presents a case study of integrating three major public chemical repositories: PubChem (176 million compounds), ChEMBL, and eMolecules, to construct a curated dataset for molecular property prediction. We investigate whether byte-offset indexing can practically overcome brute-force scalability limits while preserving data integrity at hundred-million scale. Our results document the progression from an intractable brute-force search algorithm with projected 100-day runtime to a byte-offset indexing architecture achieving 3.2-hour completion-a 740-fold performance improvement through algorithmic complexity reduction from O(NxM) to O(N+M). Systematic validation of 176 million database entries revealed hash collisions in InChIKey molecular identifiers, necessitating pipeline reconstruction using collision-free full InChI strings. We present performance benchmarks, quantify trade-offs between storage overhead and scientific rigor, and compare our approach with alternative large-scale integration strategies. The resulting system successfully extracted 435,413 validated compounds and demonstrates generalizable principles for large-scale scientific data integration where uniqueness constraints exceed hash-based identifier capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18921v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeFM: Learning Foundation Representations from Depth for Robotics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18923</link><description>arXiv:2601.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth sensors are widely deployed across robotic platforms, and advances in fast, high-fidelity depth simulation have enabled robotic policies trained on depth observations to achieve robust sim-to-real transfer for a wide range of tasks. Despite this, representation learning for depth modality remains underexplored compared to RGB, where large-scale foundation models now define the state of the art. To address this gap, we present DeFM, a self-supervised foundation model trained entirely on depth images for robotic applications. Using a DINO-style self-distillation objective on a curated dataset of 60M depth images, DeFM learns geometric and semantic representations that generalize to diverse environments, tasks, and sensors. To retain metric awareness across multiple scales, we introduce a novel input normalization strategy. We further distill DeFM into compact models suitable for resource-constrained robotic systems. When evaluated on depth-based classification, segmentation, navigation, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks, DeFM achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization from simulation to real-world environments. We release all our pretrained models, which can be adopted off-the-shelf for depth-based robotic learning without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for complex workflows, yet their ability to maintain flow of instructions remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18924v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Role of Depth in Surgical Vision Foundation Models: An Empirical Study of RGB-D Pre-training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18929</link><description>arXiv:2601.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for surgical scene understanding. However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward. These findings suggest that multimodal pre-training offers a viable path towards building more capable surgical vision systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18929v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Learning POMDPs Beyond Full-Rank Actions and State Observability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18930</link><description>arXiv:2601.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in enabling autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states, such as furniture with hidden locking mechanisms. We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18930v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BabyReasoningBench: Generating Developmentally-Inspired Reasoning Tasks for Evaluating Baby Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18933</link><description>arXiv:2601.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional evaluations of reasoning capabilities of language models are dominated by adult-centric benchmarks that presuppose broad world knowledge, complex instruction following, and mature pragmatic competence. These assumptions are mismatched to baby language models trained on developmentally plausible input such as child-directed speech and early-childhood narratives, and they obscure which reasoning abilities (if any) emerge under such constraints. We introduce BabyReasoningBench, a GPT-5.2 generated benchmark of 19 reasoning tasks grounded in classic paradigms from developmental psychology, spanning theory of mind, analogical and relational reasoning, causal inference and intervention selection, and core reasoning primitives that are known to be confounded by memory and pragmatics. We find that two GPT-2 based baby language models (pretrained on 10M and 100M of child-directed speech text) show overall low but uneven performance, with dissociations across task families: scaling improves several causal and physical reasoning tasks, while belief attribution and pragmatics-sensitive tasks remain challenging. BabyReasoningBench provides a developmentally grounded lens for analyzing what kinds of reasoning are supported by child-like training distributions, and for testing mechanistic hypotheses about how such abilities emerge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Whispering Water: Materializing Human-AI Dialogue as Interactive Ripples</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18934</link><description>arXiv:2601.18934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across cultures, water has served as a recipient of human confession, a yielding medium that receives vulnerability where rigid surfaces cannot. We present Whispering Water, an interactive installation that materializes human-AI dialogue through cymatic patterns on water. Participants confess secrets to a water surface, triggering a four-phase ritual: confession, contemplation, response, and release. The user's speech sentiment is directly transmitted into the water to prime its state, while semantic content enters a multi-agent system, initiating ripples of conversation where agent identities are situated through discourse and voice profiles are chosen based on what they say. We propose a novel algorithm that decomposes speech into component waves and reconstructs them in water, establishing a translation between speech and the physics of material form. By rendering machine reasoning as emergent physical phenomena, the installation explores possibilities for emotional self-exploration through ambiguous, sensory-rich interfaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18934v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bi-Level Online Provisioning and Scheduling with Switching Costs and Cross-Level Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18936</link><description>arXiv:2601.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a bi-level online provisioning and scheduling problem motivated by network resource allocation, where provisioning decisions are made at a slow time scale while queue-/state-dependent scheduling is performed at a fast time scale. We model this two-time-scale interaction using an upper-level online convex optimization (OCO) problem and a lower-level constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Existing OCO typically assumes stateless decisions and thus cannot capture MDP network dynamics such as queue evolution. Meanwhile, CMDP algorithms typically assume a fixed constraint threshold, whereas in provisioning-and-scheduling systems, the threshold varies with online budget decisions. To address these gaps, we study bi-level OCO-CMDP learning under switching costs (budget reprovisioning/system reconfiguration) and cross-level constraints that couple budgets to scheduling decisions. Our new algorithm solves this learning problem via several non-trivial developments, including a carefully designed dual feedback that returns the budget multiplier as sensitivity information for the upper-level update and a lower level that solves a budget-adaptive safe exploration problem via an extended occupancy-measure linear program. We establish near-optimal regret and high-probability satisfaction of the cross-level constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18936v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FSD-CAP: Fractional Subgraph Diffusion with Class-Aware Propagation for Graph Feature Imputation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18938</link><description>arXiv:2601.18938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imputing missing node features in graphs is challenging, particularly under high missing rates. Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Few Bad Neurons: Isolating and Surgically Correcting Sycophancy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18939</link><description>arXiv:2601.18939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioral alignment in large language models (LLMs) is often achieved through broad fine-tuning, which can result in undesired side effects like distributional shift and low interpretability. We propose a method for alignment that identifies and updates only the neurons most responsible for a given behavior, a targeted approach that allows for fine-tuning with significantly less data. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes, we isolate the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of a target behavior, decode them into residual space, and fine-tune only those neurons using gradient masking. We demonstrate this approach on the task of reducing sycophantic behavior, where our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models. Our results show that sparse, neuron-level updates offer a scalable and precise alternative to full-model fine-tuning, remaining effective even in situations when little data is available</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18939v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Configurable p-Neurons Using Modular p-Bits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18943</link><description>arXiv:2601.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) have recently been employed in neural networks (NNs) as stochastic neurons with sigmoidal probabilistic activation functions. Nonetheless, there remain a wealth of other probabilistic activation functions that are yet to be explored. Here we re-engineer the p-bit by decoupling its stochastic signal path from its input data path, giving rise to a modular p-bit that enables the realization of probabilistic neurons (p-neurons) with a range of configurable probabilistic activation functions, including a probabilistic version of the widely used Logistic Sigmoid, Tanh and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. We present spintronic (CMOS + sMTJ) designs that show wide and tunable probabilistic ranges of operation. Finally, we experimentally implement digital-CMOS versions on an FPGA, with stochastic unit sharing, and demonstrate an order of magnitude (10x) saving in required hardware resources compared to conventional digital p-bit implementations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions: A Real-World Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18944</link><description>arXiv:2601.18944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theorem proving is fundamental to program verification, where the automated proof of Verification Conditions (VCs) remains a primary bottleneck. Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18944v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Models for Departmental Expert Review Quality Scores</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18945</link><description>arXiv:2601.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presumably, peer reviewers and Large Language Models (LLMs) do very different things when asked to assess research. Still, recent evidence has shown that LLMs have a moderate ability to predict quality scores of published academic journal articles. One untested potential application of LLMs is for internal departmental review, which may be used to support appointment and promotion decisions or to select outputs for national assessments. This study assesses for the first time the extent to which (1) LLM quality scores align with internal departmental quality ratings and (2) LLM reports differ from expert reports. Using a private dataset of 58 published journal articles from the School of Information at the University of Sheffield, together with internal departmental quality ratings and reports, ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4o mini, and Gemini 2.0 Flash scores correlate positively and moderately with internal departmental ratings, whether the input is just title/abstract or the full text. Whilst departmental reviews tended to be more specific and showing field-level knowledge, ChatGPT reports tended to be standardised, more general, repetitive, and with unsolicited suggestions for improvement. The results therefore (a) confirm the ability of LLMs to guess the quality scores of published academic research moderately well, (b) confirm that this ability is a guess rather than an evaluation (because it can be made based on title/abstract alone), (c) extend this ability to internal departmental expert review, and (d) show that LLM reports are less insightful than human expert reports for published academic journal articles.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18945v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Strong Stability Preserving Property of Runge-Kutta Methods for Hyperbolic Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18947</link><description>arXiv:2601.18947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) time integration schemes maintain stability of the forward Euler method for any initial value problem. However, only a small subset of Runge-Kutta (RK) methods are SSP, and many efficient high-order time integration schemes do not formally belong to this class. In this work, we introduce a mathematical strategy to analyze the nonlinear stability of RK schemes that may not necessarily belong to the SSP class. With this approach, we mathematically demonstrate that there are time integration schemes outside the class of SSP schemes that can maintain entropy stability and positivity of density and pressure for the Lax-Friedrichs discretization, and Total Variation Diminishing stability for the first-order upwind and the second-order MUSCL schemes. As a result, for these problems, a broader range of RK methods, including the classical fourth-order, four-stage RK scheme, can be used while the numerical integration remains stable. Numerical experiments confirm these theoretical findings, and additional experiments demonstrate similar observations for a wider class of space discretizatins.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18947v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smart Split-Federated Learning over Noisy Channels for Embryo Image Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18948</link><description>arXiv:2601.18948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split-Federated (SplitFed) learning is an extension of federated learning that places minimal requirements on the clients computing infrastructure, since only a small portion of the overall model is deployed on the clients hardware. In SplitFed learning, feature values, gradient updates, and model updates are transferred across communication channels. In this paper, we study the effects of noise in the communication channels on the learning process and the quality of the final model. We propose a smart averaging strategy for SplitFed learning with the goal of improving resilience against channel noise. Experiments on a segmentation model for embryo images shows that the proposed smart averaging strategy is able to tolerate two orders of magnitude stronger noise in the communication channels compared to conventional averaging, while still maintaining the accuracy of the final model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18948v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tricky$^2$: Towards a Benchmark for Evaluating Human and LLM Error Interactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18949</link><description>arXiv:2601.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, yet they often introduce subtle logic or data-misuse errors that differ from human bugs. To study how these two error types interact, we construct Tricky$^2$, a hybrid dataset that augments the existing TrickyBugs corpus of human-written defects with errors injected by both GPT-5 and OpenAI-oss-20b across C++, Python, and Java programs. Our approach uses a taxonomy-guided prompting framework to generate machine-originated bugs while preserving original human defects and program structure. The resulting corpus spans human-only, LLM-only, and human+LLM splits, enabling analysis of mixed-origin error behavior, multi-bug repair robustness, and reliability in hybrid human-machine code. This paper outlines the dataset construction pipeline and illustrates its use through small-scale baseline evaluations of classification, localization, and repair tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18949v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vector-Valued Distributional Reinforcement Learning Policy Evaluation: A Hilbert Space Embedding Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18952</link><description>arXiv:2601.18952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an (offline) multi-dimensional distributional reinforcement learning framework (KE-DRL) that leverages Hilbert space mappings to estimate the kernel mean embedding of the multi-dimensional value distribution under a proposed target policy. In our setting, the state-action variables are multi-dimensional and continuous. By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees. Simulations and empirical results demonstrate robust off-policy evaluation and recovery of the kernel mean embedding under mild assumptions, namely, Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the kernels, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches in complex real-world decision-making scenarios and risk evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18952v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] 3D-Printed Hybrid Liquid-CPCM Cooling Modules for High-Performance Thermal Management of Lithium-Ion Pouch Cells</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18959</link><description>arXiv:2601.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient thermal management is critical for ensuring the safety, performance, and durability of lithium ion pouch cells (LIPCs), particularly under high power operating conditions where conventional battery thermal management systems (BTMS) struggle to balance cooling effectiveness, structural simplicity, and weight. Here, we report a lightweight hybrid BTMS that synergistically integrates active liquid cooling with composite phase change material (CPCM) based thermal buffering through a 3D printed hexagonal architecture. The system is fabricated via a two step additive manufacturing process that enables sealed CPCM encapsulation and isolated liquid cooling pathways within a single carbon fiber reinforced nylon module, effectively eliminating leakage risks while allowing precise geometric control. Hexagonally partitioned CPCM cavities maximize the CPCM wall interfacial area and shorten internal conduction paths, accelerating latent heat absorption, while embedded serpentine liquid channels provide continuous convective heat removal and prevent CPCM saturation. A nanocarbon enhanced CPCM is employed to overcome the intrinsic low thermal conductivity of conventional paraffin based materials.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fauna Sprout: A lightweight, approachable, developer-ready humanoid robot</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18963</link><description>arXiv:2601.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in learned control, large-scale simulation, and generative models have accelerated progress toward general-purpose robotic controllers, yet the field still lacks platforms suitable for safe, expressive, long-term deployment in human environments. Most existing humanoids are either closed industrial systems or academic prototypes that are difficult to deploy and operate around people, limiting progress in robotics. We introduce Sprout, a developer platform designed to address these limitations through an emphasis on safety, expressivity, and developer accessibility. Sprout adopts a lightweight form factor with compliant control, limited joint torques, and soft exteriors to support safe operation in shared human spaces. The platform integrates whole-body control, manipulation with integrated grippers, and virtual-reality-based teleoperation within a unified hardware-software stack. An expressive head further enables social interaction -- a domain that remains underexplored on most utilitarian humanoids. By lowering physical and technical barriers to deployment, Sprout expands access to capable humanoid platforms and provides a practical basis for developing embodied intelligence in real human environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18963v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] People Can Accurately Predict Behavior of Complex Algorithms That Are Available, Compact, and Aligned</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18966</link><description>arXiv:2601.18966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users trust algorithms more when they can predict the algorithms' behavior. Simple algorithms trivially yield predictively accurate mental models, but modern AI algorithms have often been assumed too complex for people to build predictive mental models, especially in the social media domain. In this paper, we describe conditions under which even complex algorithms can yield predictive mental models, opening up opportunities for a broader set of human-centered algorithms. We theorize that users will form an accurate predictive mental model of an algorithm's behavior if and only if the algorithm simultaneously satisfies three criteria: (1) cognitive availability of the underlying concepts being modeled, (2) concept compactness (does it form a single cognitive construct?), and (3) high alignment between the person's and algorithm's execution of the concept. We evaluate this theory through a pre-registered experiment (N=1250) where users predict behavior of 25 social media feed ranking algorithms that vary on these criteria. We find that even complex (e.g., LLM-based) algorithms enjoy accurate prediction rates when they meet all criteria, and even simple (e.g., basic term count) algorithms fail to be predictable when a single criterion fails. We also find that these criteria determine outcomes beyond prediction accuracy, such as which mental models users deploy to make their predictions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18966v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pay Attention to Where You Look</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18970</link><description>arXiv:2601.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) has advanced with generative modeling, enabling photorealistic image generation. In few-shot NVS, where only a few input views are available, existing methods often assume equal importance for all input views relative to the target, leading to suboptimal results.
  We address this limitation by introducing a camera-weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of source views based on their relevance to the target. We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting. Additionally, models can be further trained with our camera-weighting scheme to refine their understanding of view relevance and enhance synthesis quality. This mechanism is adaptable and can be integrated into various NVS algorithms, improving their ability to synthesize high-quality novel views. Our results demonstrate that adaptive view weighting enhances accuracy and realism, offering a promising direction for improving NVS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18970v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Self-Optimizing Electron Microscope: Robust Tuning of Aberration Coefficients via Physics-Aware Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18972</link><description>arXiv:2601.18972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18972v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Does Adaptation Win?

Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $&gt;40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics.

These tasks often rely on low-level traffic control settings, which require manual setup and technical expertise. This paper presents an automated framework that converts high-level traffic shaping intents in natural or declarative language into valid and correct traffic control rules. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\. A thorough sensitivity study demonstrates that AQM-guided prompting reduces variability threefold compared to zero-shot baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18974v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Attention-Enhanced Graph Filtering for False Data Injection Attack Detection and Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18981</link><description>arXiv:2601.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled measurement devices in modern power systems has expanded the cyberattack surface of the grid. As a result, this critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to cyberattacks, including false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that compromise measurement integrity and threaten reliable system operation. Existing FDIA detection methods primarily exploit spatial correlations and network topology using graph-based learning; however, these approaches often rely on high-dimensional representations and shallow classifiers, limiting their ability to capture local structural dependencies and global contextual relationships. Moreover, naively incorporating Transformer architectures can result in overly deep models that struggle to model localized grid dynamics. This paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework that integrates auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph convolutional filters with an Encoder-Only Transformer architecture. The ARMA-based graph filters provide robust, topology-aware feature extraction and adaptability to abrupt spectral changes, while the Transformer encoder leverages self-attention to capture long-range dependencies among grid elements without sacrificing essential local context. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world load data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) applied to the IEEE 14- and 300-bus systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively exploits both the state and topology of the power grid, achieving high accuracy in detecting FDIA events and localizing compromised nodes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18981v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trustworthy Scheduling for Big Data Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18983</link><description>arXiv:2601.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in modern containerized execution environments have resulted in substantial benefits in terms of elasticity and more efficient utilization of computing resources. Although existing schedulers strive to optimize performance metrics like task execution times and resource utilization, they provide limited transparency into their decision-making processes or the specific actions developers must take to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs). In this work, we propose X-Sched, a middleware that uses explainability techniques to generate actionable guidance on resource configurations that makes task execution in containerized environments feasible, under resource and time constraints. X-Sched addresses this gap by integrating counterfactual explanations with advanced machine learning models, such as Random Forests, to efficiently identify optimal configurations. This approach not only ensures that tasks are executed in line with performance goals but also gives users clear, actionable insights into the rationale behind scheduling decisions. Our experimental results validated with data from real-world execution environments, illustrate the efficiency, benefits and practicality of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18983v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Save the Good Prefix: Precise Error Penalization via Process-Supervised RL to Enhance LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18984</link><description>arXiv:2601.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18984v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMs versus the Halting Problem: Revisiting Program Termination Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18987</link><description>arXiv:2601.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18987v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FreeOrbit4D: Training-Free Arbitrary Camera Redirection for Monocular Videos via Geometry-Complete 4D Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18993</link><description>arXiv:2601.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera redirection aims to replay a dynamic scene from a single monocular video under a user-specified camera trajectory. However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation. Project page and code will be released soon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18993v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Anatomically-aware conformal prediction for medical image segmentation with random walks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18997</link><description>arXiv:2601.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable deployment of deep learning in medical imaging requires uncertainty quantification that provides rigorous error guarantees while remaining anatomically meaningful. Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing statistically valid prediction intervals. However, standard applications in segmentation often ignore anatomical context, resulting in fragmented, spatially incoherent, and over-segmented prediction sets that limit clinical utility. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Random-Walk Conformal Prediction (RW-CP), a model-agnostic framework which can be added on top of any segmentation method. RW-CP enforces spatial coherence to generate anatomically valid sets. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbour graph from pre-trained vision foundation model features and applies a random walk to diffuse uncertainty. The random walk diffusion regularizes the non-conformity scores, making the prediction sets less sensitive to the conformal calibration parameter $\lambda$, ensuring more stable and continuous anatomical boundaries. RW-CP maintains rigorous marginal coverage while significantly improving segmentation quality. Evaluations on multi-modal public datasets show improvements of up to $35.4\%$ compared to standard CP baselines, given an allowable error rate of $\alpha=0.1$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18997v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Malicious Repurposing of Open Science Artefacts by Using Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18998</link><description>arXiv:2601.18998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has fuelled enthusiasm about their role in advancing scientific discovery, with studies exploring LLMs that autonomously generate and evaluate novel research ideas. However, little attention has been given to the possibility that such models could be exploited to produce harmful research by repurposing open science artefacts for malicious ends. We fill the gap by introducing an end-to-end pipeline that first bypasses LLM safeguards through persuasion-based jailbreaking, then reinterprets NLP papers to identify and repurpose their artefacts (datasets, methods, and tools) by exploiting their vulnerabilities, and finally assesses the safety of these proposals using our evaluation framework across three dimensions: harmfulness, feasibility of misuse, and soundness of technicality. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate harmful proposals by repurposing ethically designed open artefacts; however, we find that LLMs acting as evaluators strongly disagree with one another on evaluation outcomes: GPT-4.1 assigns higher scores (indicating greater potential harms, higher soundness and feasibility of misuse), Gemini-2.5-pro is markedly stricter, and Grok-3 falls between these extremes. This indicates that LLMs cannot yet serve as reliable judges in a malicious evaluation setup, making human evaluation essential for credible dual-use risk assessment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18998v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Randomization Boosts KV Caching, Learning Balances Query Load: A Joint Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18999</link><description>arXiv:2601.18999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose FROST, an attention-aware method for efficient reasoning. Unlike traditional approaches, FROST leverages attention weights to prune uncritical reasoning paths, yielding shorter and more reliable reasoning trajectories. Methodologically, we introduce the concept of reasoning outliers and design an attention-based mechanism to remove them. Theoretically, FROST preserves and enhances the model's reasoning capacity while eliminating outliers at the sentence level. Empirically, we validate FROST on four benchmarks using two strong reasoning models (Phi-4-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B), outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as TALE and ThinkLess. Notably, FROST achieves an average 69.68% reduction in token usage and a 26.70% improvement in accuracy over the base model. Furthermore, in evaluations of attention outlier metrics, FROST reduces the maximum infinity norm by 15.97% and the average kurtosis by 91.09% compared to the base model.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to computationally efficient GP training based on the observation that square-exponential (SE) covariance matrices contain several off-diagonal entries extremely close to zero.

We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method to preserve the structure of the original covariance in the 1D setting with SE kernel, and validate its computational efficiency against the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Non-Invasive 3D Wound Measurement with RGB-D Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19014</link><description>arXiv:2601.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic wound monitoring and management require accurate and efficient wound measurement methods. This paper presents a fast, non-invasive 3D wound measurement algorithm based on RGB-D imaging. The method combines RGB-D odometry with B-spline surface reconstruction to generate detailed 3D wound meshes, enabling automatic computation of clinically relevant wound measurements such as perimeter, surface area, and dimensions. We evaluated our system on realistic silicone wound phantoms and measured sub-millimetre 3D reconstruction accuracy compared with high-resolution ground-truth scans. The extracted measurements demonstrated low variability across repeated captures and strong agreement with manual assessments. The proposed pipeline also outperformed a state-of-the-art object-centric RGB-D reconstruction method while maintaining runtimes suitable for real-time clinical deployment. Our approach offers a promising tool for automated wound assessment in both clinical and remote healthcare settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Average-Case Reductions for $k$-XOR and Tensor PCA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19016</link><description>arXiv:2601.19016v1 Announce Type: new

We introduce two \emph{densifying} reductions that increase the number of observed entries while controlling the decrease in signal, and, in particular, reduce any $k\mathsf{\text{-}XOR}$ instance at the computational threshold to Tensor PCA at the computational threshold. Additionally, we give new order-reducing maps (e.g., $5\to 4$ $k\mathsf{\text{-}XOR}$ and $7\to 4$ Tensor PCA) at fixed entry density.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19016v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Framework for Evaluating Faithfulness in Explainable AI for Machine Anomalous Sound Detection Using Frequency-Band Perturbation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19017</link><description>arXiv:2601.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is commonly applied to anomalous sound detection (ASD) models to identify which time-frequency regions of an audio signal contribute to an anomaly decision. However, most audio explanations rely on qualitative inspection of saliency maps, leaving open the question of whether these attributions accurately reflect the spectral cues the model uses. In this work, we introduce a new quantitative framework for evaluating XAI faithfulness in machine-sound analysis by directly linking attribution relevance to model behaviour through systematic frequency-band removal. This approach provides an objective measure of whether an XAI method for machine ASD correctly identifies frequency regions that influence an ASD model's predictions. By using four widely adopted methods, namely Integrated Gradients, Occlusion, Grad-CAM and SmoothGrad, we show that XAI techniques differ in reliability, with Occlusion demonstrating the strongest alignment with true model sensitivity and gradient-+based methods often failing to accurately capture spectral dependencies. The proposed framework offers a reproducible way to benchmark audio explanations and enables more trustworthy interpretation of spectrogram-based ASD systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19017v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AAA least squares solution of Helmholtz problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19020</link><description>arXiv:2601.19020v1 Announce Type: new

Furthermore, we establish a formal connection between the Helmholtz and Laplace problems, providing a theoretical justification for the "double poles" technique. The approach offers a robust, meshless alternative to heuristic source placement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19020v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Listening before Asking: Lived-Experience Advisors as Methodological Partners in Dementia Caregiving Studies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19021</link><description>arXiv:2601.19021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research with dementia caregivers poses persistent methodological and ethical challenges, particularly when interview-based studies are designed without sufficient grounding in lived caregiving realities. Questions framed through clinical or deficit-oriented assumptions risk alienating participants, undermining rapport, and producing shallow or ethically fraught data. While human-computer interaction (HCI) research increasingly adopts participatory approaches in technology design, participation rarely extends to the design of research methods themselves. This paper examines the role of lived-experience advisors as methodological partners in caregiver interview research. We report on a qualitative study in which two advisors with extensive dementia caregiving experience were engaged prior to fieldwork as methodological partners, extending participatory principles beyond technology design into the design of research methods themselves. Drawing on transcripts of advisor consultations and subsequent interviews with ten caregivers and one person living with dementia, we identify two key methodological contributions of advisor involvement. First, advisors enabled anticipatory validity by surfacing caregiving challenges, ethical sensitivities, and interpretive concerns that later appeared in caregiver interviews, allowing the researcher to enter the field with grounded awareness under constrained recruitment and fieldwork conditions. Second, advisors provided cultural, emotional, and systemic context that improved interpretive sensitivity and helped avoid misreadings. We argue that lived experience functions as methodological infrastructure, extending participatory principles into the design and conduct of research itself, and constituting a generalizable methodological pattern for HCI research with caregivers and other vulnerable or marginalized populations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19021v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EVEREST: An Evidential, Tail-Aware Transformer for Rare-Event Time-Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19022</link><description>arXiv:2601.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty. We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19022v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Is Finer Better? The Limits of Microscaling Formats in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19026</link><description>arXiv:2601.19026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Design and Evaluation of Next-Generation Cellular Networks through Digital and Physical Open and Programmable Platforms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19027</link><description>arXiv:2601.19027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the Radio Access Network (RAN) in 5G and 6G technologies marks a shift toward open, programmable, and softwarized architectures, driven by the Open RAN paradigm. This approach emphasizes open interfaces for telemetry sharing, intelligent data-driven control loops for network optimization, and virtualization and disaggregation of multi-vendor RAN components. While promising, this transition introduces significant challenges, including the need to design interoperable solutions, acquire datasets to train and test AI/ML algorithms for inference and control, and develop testbeds to benchmark these solutions. Experimental wireless platforms and private 5G deployments play a key role, providing architectures comparable to real-world systems and enabling prototyping and testing in realistic environments. This dissertation focuses on the development and evaluation of complementary experimental platforms: Colosseum, the world's largest Open RAN digital twin, and X5G, an open, programmable, multi-vendor private 5G O-RAN testbed with GPU acceleration. The main contributions include: (i) CaST, enabling automated creation and validation of digital twin wireless scenarios through 3D modeling, ray-tracing, and channel sounding; (ii) validation of Colosseum digital twins at scale, demonstrating that emulated environments closely reproduce real-world setups; (iii) X5G, integrating NVIDIA Aerial GPU-accelerated PHY processing with OpenAirInterface higher layers; (iv) a GPU-accelerated dApp framework for real-time RAN inference, enabling sub-millisecond control loops for AI-native applications including ISAC; and (v) intelligent RAN applications spanning spectrum sharing, interference detection, network slicing, security, and CSI-based sensing.

Abstract: Automated piano performance evaluation traditionally relies on symbolic (MIDI) representations, which capture note-level information but miss the acoustic nuances that characterize expressive playing. I propose using pre-trained audio foundation models, specifically MuQ and MERT, to predict 19 perceptual dimensions of piano performance quality. Using synthesized audio from PercePiano MIDI files (rendered via Pianoteq), I compare audio and symbolic approaches under controlled conditions where both derive from identical source data. The best model, MuQ layers 9-12 with Pianoteq soundfont augmentation, achieves R^2 = 0.537 (95% CI: [0.465, 0.575]), representing a 55% improvement over the symbolic baseline (R^2 = 0.347). Statistical analysis confirms significance (p &lt; 10^-25) with audio outperforming symbolic on all 19 dimensions. I validate the approach through cross-soundfont generalization (R^2 = 0.534 +/- 0.075), difficulty correlation with an external dataset (rho = 0.623), and multi-performer consistency analysis. Analysis of audio-symbolic fusion reveals high error correlation (r = 0.738), explaining why fusion provides minimal benefit: audio representations alone are sufficient.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^\pi, d, 1/n,\log(1/\delta)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^\pi$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.
  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19030v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] XIMP: Cross Graph Inter-Message Passing for Molecular Property Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19037</link><description>arXiv:2601.19037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is central to drug discovery, yet graph neural networks often underperform in data-scarce regimes and fail to surpass traditional fingerprints. We introduce cross-graph inter-message passing (XIMP), which performs message passing both within and across multiple related graph representations. For small molecules, we combine the molecular graph with scaffold-aware junction trees and pharmacophore-encoding extended reduced graphs, integrating complementary abstractions. While prior work is either limited to a single abstraction or non-iterative communication across graphs, XIMP supports an arbitrary number of abstractions and both direct and indirect communication between them in each layer. Across ten diverse molecular property prediction tasks, XIMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most cases, leveraging interpretable abstractions as an inductive bias that guides learning toward established chemical concepts, enhancing generalization in low-data settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OATS: Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19040</link><description>arXiv:2601.19040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are a powerful paradigm for time series analysis and are often enhanced by synthetic data augmentation to improve the training data quality. Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

Abstract: Heatmap-based non-autoregressive solvers for large-scale Travelling Salesman Problems output dense edge-probability scores, yet final performance largely hinges on the decoder that must satisfy degree-2 constraints and form a single Hamiltonian tour. Greedy commitment can cascade into irreparable mistakes at large $N$, whereas MCTS-guided local search is accurate but compute-heavy and highly engineered. We instead treat the heatmap as a soft edge prior and cast decoding as probabilistic tour construction under feasibility constraints, where the key is to correct local mis-rankings via inexpensive global coordination. Based on this view, we introduce HeatACO, a plug-and-play Max-Min Ant System decoder whose transition policy is softly biased by the heatmap while pheromone updates provide lightweight, instance-specific feedback to resolve global conflicts; optional 2-opt/3-opt post-processing further improves tour quality. On TSP500/1K/10K, using heatmaps produced by four pretrained predictors, HeatACO+2opt achieves gaps down to 0.11%/0.23%/1.15% with seconds-to-minutes CPU decoding for fixed heatmaps, offering a better quality--time trade-off than greedy decoding and published MCTS-based decoders. Finally, we find the gains track heatmap reliability: under distribution shift, miscalibration and confidence collapse bound decoding improvements, suggesting heatmap generalisation is a primary lever for further progress.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NC-Reg : Neural Cortical Maps for Rigid Registration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19042</link><description>arXiv:2601.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce neural cortical maps, a continuous and compact neural representation for cortical feature maps, as an alternative to traditional discrete structures such as grids and meshes. It can learn from meshes of arbitrary size and provide learnt features at any resolution. Neural cortical maps enable efficient optimization on the sphere and achieve runtimes up to 30 times faster than classic barycentric interpolation (for the same number of iterations). As a proof of concept, we investigate rigid registration of cortical surfaces and propose NC-Reg, a novel iterative algorithm that involves the use of neural cortical feature maps, gradient descent optimization and a simulated annealing strategy. Through ablation studies and subject-to-template experiments, our method demonstrates sub-degree accuracy ($&lt;1^\circ$ from the global optimum), and serves as a promising robust pre-alignment strategy, which is critical in clinical settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19042v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning-Based Evaluation of Attitude Sensor Characteristics Using Microsatellite Flight Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19047</link><description>arXiv:2601.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using actual flight data from a 50-cm-class microsatellite whose mission and operations have already been completed, this study re-evaluates satellite attitude determination performance and the error characteristics of onboard attitude sensors. While conventional approaches rely on batch estimation or Kalman filtering based on predefined physical models and white-noise assumptions, this research introduces a machine-learning-based approach to extract and correct structural and nonlinear error patterns embedded in real observational data. In this study, high-quality attitude determination results obtained from star sensors and a fiber optical gyro (FOG) are treated as ground truth, and machine learning is applied to coarse attitude sensor data consisting of Sun sensors and magnetic field sensors. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D) is employed to regressively predict attitude from short sequences of time-series sensor measurements. The model is trained and evaluated using five sets of on-orbit observation logs, with four passes used for training and one independent pass used for testing. The results show that, while conventional coarse attitude determination using the TRIAD method yields attitude errors on the order of 7 deg RMS, the proposed machine-learning approach achieves RMS errors of approximately 0.7 deg for the training data and 2-3 deg for the test data, depending on the sensor combination.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NuiWorld: Exploring a Scalable Framework for End-to-End Controllable World Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19048</link><description>arXiv:2601.19048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World generation is a fundamental capability for applications like video games, simulation, and robotics. However, existing approaches face three main obstacles: controllability, scalability, and efficiency. End-to-end scene generation models have been limited by data scarcity. While object-centric generation approaches rely on fixed resolution representations, degrading fidelity for larger scenes. Training-free approaches, while flexible, are often slow and computationally expensive at inference time. We present NuiWorld, a framework that attempts to address these challenges. To overcome data scarcity, we propose a generative bootstrapping strategy that starts from a few input images. Leveraging recent 3D reconstruction and expandable scene generation techniques, we synthesize scenes of varying sizes and layouts, producing enough data to train an end-to-end model. Furthermore, our framework enables controllability through pseudo sketch labels, and demonstrates a degree of generalization to previously unseen sketches. Our approach represents scenes as a collection of variable scene chunks, which are compressed into a flattened vector-set representation. This significantly reduces the token length for large scenes, enabling consistent geometric fidelity across scenes sizes while improving training and inference efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Proactive Hardening of LLM Defenses with HASTE</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19051</link><description>arXiv:2601.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt-based attack techniques are one of the primary challenges in securely deploying and protecting LLM-based AI systems. LLM inputs are an unbounded, unstructured space. Consequently, effectively defending against these attacks requires proactive hardening strategies capable of continuously generating adaptive attack vectors to optimize LLM defense at runtime. We present HASTE (Hard-negative Attack Sample Training Engine): a systematic framework that iteratively engineers highly evasive prompts, within a modular optimization process, to continuously enhance detection efficacy for prompt-based attack techniques. The framework is agnostic to synthetic data generation methods, and can be generalized to evaluate prompt-injection detection efficacy, with and without fuzzing, for any hard-negative or hard-positive iteration strategy. Experimental evaluation of HASTE shows that hard negative mining successfully evades baseline detectors, reducing malicious prompt detection for baseline detectors by approximately 64%. However, when integrated with detection model re-training, it optimizes the efficacy of prompt detection models with significantly fewer iteration loops compared to relative baseline strategies. The HASTE framework supports both proactive and reactive hardening of LLM defenses and guardrails. Proactively, developers can leverage HASTE to dynamically stress-test prompt injection detection systems; efficiently identifying weaknesses and strengthening defensive posture. Reactively, HASTE can mimic newly observed attack types and rapidly bridge detection coverage by teaching HASTE-optimized detection models to identify them.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19051v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Answer Givers to Design Mentors: Guiding LLMs with the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19053</link><description>arXiv:2601.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design feedback helps practitioners improve their artifacts while also fostering reflection and design reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can support design work, but often provide generic, one-off suggestions that limit reflective engagement. We investigate how to guide LLMs to act as design mentors by applying the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model, which emphasizes demonstrating reasoning through six methods: modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration. We operationalize these instructional methods through structured prompting and evaluate them in a within-subjects study with data visualization practitioners. Participants interacted with both a baseline LLM and an instructional LLM designed with cognitive apprenticeship prompts. Surveys, interviews, and conversational log analyses compared experiences across conditions. Our findings show that cognitively informed prompts elicit deeper design reasoning and more reflective feedback exchanges, though the baseline is sometimes preferred depending on task types or experience levels. We distill design considerations for AI-assisted feedback systems that foster reflective practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19053v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Principled Fine-tuning of LLMs from User-Edits: A Medley of Preference, Supervision, and Reward</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19055</link><description>arXiv:2601.19055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit deployment data consisting of a set of context, an agent's response, and user edits. This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19055v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pixel-Grounded Retrieval for Knowledgeable Large Multimodal Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19060</link><description>arXiv:2601.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) often requires coupling fine-grained perception with factual knowledge beyond the input image. Prior multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) systems improve factual grounding but lack an internal policy for when and how to retrieve. We propose PixSearch, the first end-to-end Segmenting Large Multimodal Model (LMM) that unifies region-level perception and retrieval-augmented reasoning. During encoding, PixSearch emits  tokens to trigger retrieval, selects query modalities (text, image, or region), and generates pixel-level masks that directly serve as visual queries, eliminating the reliance on modular pipelines (detectors, segmenters, captioners, etc.). A two-stage supervised fine-tuning regimen with search-interleaved supervision teaches retrieval timing and query selection while preserving segmentation ability. On egocentric and entity-centric VQA benchmarks, PixSearch substantially improves factual consistency and generalization, yielding a 19.7% relative gain in accuracy on CRAG-MM compared to whole image retrieval, while retaining competitive reasoning performance on various VQA and text-only QA tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19060v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Thought-Transfer: Indirect Targeted Poisoning Attacks on Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19061</link><description>arXiv:2601.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing large language models' capabilities by generating intermediate reasoning steps for complex tasks. A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our "Thought-Transfer" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset. Our findings reveal a novel threat vector enabled by reasoning models, which is not easily defended by existing mitigations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19061v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who's in Charge?

Abstract: Although AI assistants are now deeply embedded in society, there has been limited empirical study of how their usage affects human empowerment. We present the first large-scale empirical analysis of disempowerment patterns in real-world AI assistant interactions, analyzing 1.5 million consumer Claude.ai conversations using a privacy-preserving approach. We focus on situational disempowerment potential, which occurs when AI assistant interactions risk leading users to form distorted perceptions of reality, make inauthentic value judgments, or act in ways misaligned with their values. Quantitatively, we find that severe forms of disempowerment potential occur in fewer than one in a thousand conversations, though rates are substantially higher in personal domains like relationships and lifestyle. Qualitatively, we uncover several concerning patterns, such as validation of persecution narratives and grandiose identities with emphatic sycophantic language, definitive moral judgments about third parties, and complete scripting of value-laden personal communications that users appear to implement verbatim. Analysis of historical trends reveals an increase in the prevalence of disempowerment potential over time. We also find that interactions with greater disempowerment potential receive higher user approval ratings, possibly suggesting a tension between short-term user preferences and long-term human empowerment. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems designed to robustly support human autonomy and flourishing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19062v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimizing Conversational Quality in Spoken Dialogue Systems with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19063</link><description>arXiv:2601.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) for speech-in/speech-out dialogue systems (SDS) remains underexplored, with prior work largely limited to single semantic rewards applied at the utterance level. Such setups overlook the multi-dimensional and multi-modal nature of conversational quality, which encompasses semantic coherence, audio naturalness, speaker consistency, emotion alignment, and turn-taking behavior. Moreover, they are fundamentally mismatched with duplex spoken dialogue systems that generate responses incrementally, where agents must make decisions based on partial utterances. We address these limitations with the first multi-reward RLAIF framework for SDS, combining semantic, audio-quality, and emotion-consistency rewards. To align utterance-level preferences with incremental, blockwise decoding in duplex models, we apply turn-level preference sampling and aggregate per-block log-probabilities within a single DPO objective. We present the first systematic study of preference learning for improving SDS quality in both multi-turn Chain-of-Thought and blockwise duplex models, and release a multi-reward DPO dataset to support reproducible research. Experiments show that single-reward RLAIF selectively improves its targeted metric, while joint multi-reward training yields consistent gains across semantic quality and audio naturalness. These results highlight the importance of holistic, multi-reward alignment for practical conversational SDS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19063v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Cogeneration of Bug Reproduction Test in Agentic Program Repair</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19066</link><description>arXiv:2601.19066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs) have been used in many agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) systems, primarily for validating promising fixes and aiding fix generation. In practice, when developers submit a patch, they often implement the BRT alongside the fix. Our experience deploying agentic APR reveals that developers similarly desire a BRT within AI-generated patches to increase their confidence. However, canonical APR systems tend to generate BRTs and fixes separately, or focus on producing only the fix in the final patch. In this paper, we study agentic APR in the context of cogeneration, where the APR agent is instructed to generate both a fix and a BRT in the same patch. We evaluate the effectiveness of different cogeneration strategies on 120 human-reported bugs at Google and characterize different cogeneration strategies by their influence on APR agent behavior. We develop and evaluate patch selectors that account for test change information to select patches with plausible fixes (and plausible BRTs). Finally, we analyze the root causes of failed cogeneration trajectories. Importantly, we show that cogeneration allows the APR agent to generate BRTs for at least as many bugs as a dedicated BRT agent, without compromising the generation rate of plausible fixes, thereby reducing engineering effort in maintaining and coordinating separate generation pipelines for fix and BRT at scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19066v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Critical Organization of Deep Neural Networks, and p-Adic Statistical Field Theories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19070</link><description>arXiv:2601.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously study the thermodynamic limit of deep neural networks (DNNS) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), assuming that the activation functions are sigmoids. A thermodynamic limit is a continuous neural network, where the neurons form a continuous space with infinitely many points. We show that such a network admits a unique state in a certain region of the parameter space, which depends continuously on the parameters. This state breaks into an infinite number of states outside the mentioned region of parameter space. Then, the critical organization is a bifurcation in the parameter space, where a network transitions from a unique state to infinitely many states. We use p-adic integers to codify hierarchical structures. Indeed, we present an algorithm that recasts the hierarchical topologies used in DNNs and RNNs as p-adic tree-like structures. In this framework, the hierarchical and the critical organizations are connected. We study rigorously the critical organization of a toy model, a hierarchical edge detector for grayscale images based on p-adic cellular neural networks. The critical organization of such a network can be described as a strange attractor. In the second part, we study random versions of DNNs and RNNs. In this case, the network parameters are generalized Gaussian random variables in a space of quadratic integrable functions. We compute the probability distribution of the output given the input, in the infinite-width case. We show that it admits a power-type expansion, where the constant term is a Gaussian distribution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19070v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HalluJudge: A Reference-Free Hallucination Detection for Context Misalignment in Code Review Automation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19072</link><description>arXiv:2601.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code review automation, such as review comment generation, yet they suffer from hallucinations -- where the generated review comments are ungrounded in the actual code -- poses a significant challenge to the adoption of LLMs in code review workflows. To address this, we explore effective and scalable methods for a hallucination detection in LLM-generated code review comments without the reference. In this work, we design HalluJudge that aims to assess the grounding of generated review comments based on the context alignment. HalluJudge includes four key strategies ranging from direct assessment to structured multi-branch reasoning (e.g., Tree-of-Thoughts). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these assessment strategies across Atlassian's enterprise-scale software projects to examine the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of HalluJudge. Furthermore, we analyze the alignment between HalluJudge's judgment and developer preference of the actual LLM-generated code review comments in the real-world production. Our results show that the hallucination assessment in HalluJudge is cost-effective with an F1 score of 0.85 and an average cost of $0.009. On average, 67% of the HalluJudge assessments are aligned with the developer preference of the actual LLM-generated review comments in the online production. Our results suggest that HalluJudge can serve as a practical safeguard to reduce developers' exposure to hallucinated comments, fostering trust in AI-assisted code reviews.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19072v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FTA-NTN: Fairness and Throughput Assurance in Non-Terrestrial Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19078</link><description>arXiv:2601.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing optimal non-terrestrial network (NTN) constellations is essential for maximizing throughput and ensuring fair resource distribution. This paper presents FTA-NTN (Fairness and Throughput Assurance in Non-Terrestrial Networks), a multi-objective optimization framework that jointly maximizes throughput and fairness under realistic system constraints. The framework integrates multi-layer Walker Delta constellations, a parametric mobility model for user distributions across Canadian land regions, adaptive K-Means clustering for beamforming and user association, and Bayesian optimization for parameter tuning. Simulation results with 500 users show that FTA-NTN achieves over 9.88 Gbps of aggregate throughput with an average fairness of 0.42, corresponding to an optimal configuration of 9 planes with 15 satellites per plane in LEO and 7 planes with 3 satellites per plane in MEO. These values align with 3GPP NTN evaluation scenarios and representative system assumptions, confirming their relevance for realistic deployments. Overall, FTA-NTN demonstrates that throughput and fairness can be jointly optimized under practical constraints, advancing beyond throughput-centric designs in the literature and offering a scalable methodology for next-generation NTN deployments that supports efficient and equitable global connectivity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19078v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neuromorphic BrailleNet: Accurate and Generalizable Braille Reading Beyond Single Characters through Event-Based Optical Tactile Sensing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19079</link><description>arXiv:2601.19079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional robotic Braille readers typically rely on discrete, character-by-character scanning, limiting reading speed and disrupting natural flow. Vision-based alternatives often require substantial computation, introduce latency, and degrade in real-world conditions. In this work, we present a high accuracy, real-time pipeline for continuous Braille recognition using Evetac, an open-source neuromorphic event-based tactile sensor. Unlike frame-based vision systems, the neuromorphic tactile modality directly encodes dynamic contact events during continuous sliding, closely emulating human finger-scanning strategies. Our approach combines spatiotemporal segmentation with a lightweight ResNet-based classifier to process sparse event streams, enabling robust character recognition across varying indentation depths and scanning speeds. The proposed system achieves near-perfect accuracy (&gt;=98%) at standard depths, generalizes across multiple Braille board layouts, and maintains strong performance under fast scanning. On a physical Braille board containing daily-living vocabulary, the system attains over 90% word-level accuracy, demonstrating robustness to temporal compression effects that challenge conventional methods.

We investigate how payoff magnitude and linguistic context shape LLM strategies in repeated social dilemmas, using a payoff-scaled Prisoner's Dilemma to isolate sensitivity to incentive strength. Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects. Our results provide a unified framework for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and highlight cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance and multi-agent system design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19082v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Speed is Confidence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19085</link><description>arXiv:2601.19085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological neural systems must be fast but are energy-constrained. Evolution's solution: act on the first signal. Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss "winner," a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min). Higher accuracy requires 36k steps: 1.5 hours for K = 1, 6 hours for K = 4.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19085v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] 3D-Printed Passive Reflectors for mmWave Beam Steering via Binary Aperture Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19087</link><description>arXiv:2601.19087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theory-to-hardware framework for fully passive millimeter-wave beam control aimed at extending indoor coverage. The reflecting aperture is modeled using an equivalent array-factor formulation in which each passive element contributes a reradiated field determined by the incident and desired departure angles. Building on this model, we develop two implementation-friendly passive design approaches: (i) binary (1-bit) spatial masking, which enables beam steering and multi-beam synthesis by selecting element participation on a dense lattice via an ON/OFF metallization pattern, and (ii) diffraction-order (periodic) steering, which exploits controlled aperture periodicity to place selected diffraction orders at prescribed angles. Theoretical analysis characterizes the asymptotic activation behavior of the binary mask and establishes a distribution-free lower-bound on the achievable gain. Prototypes are realized using a copper-backed 3D-printed substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements in single- and multi-beam configurations validate the predicted steering behavior. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that fully passive, binary-coded apertures can provide deterministic beam control and offer a scalable alternative to power-consuming reconfigurable surfaces for static indoor links.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19087v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid Fault-Driven Mutation Testing for Python</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19088</link><description>arXiv:2601.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutation testing is an effective technique for assessing the effectiveness of test suites by systematically injecting artificial faults into programs. However, existing mutation testing techniques fall short in capturing many types of common faults in dynamically typed languages like Python. In this paper, we introduce a novel set of seven mutation operators that are inspired by prevalent anti-patterns in Python programs, designed to complement the existing general-purpose operators and broaden the spectrum of simulated faults. We propose a mutation testing technique that utilizes a hybrid of static and dynamic analyses to mutate Python programs based on these operators while minimizing equivalent mutants. We implement our approach in a tool called PyTation and evaluate it on 13 open-source Python applications. Our results show that PyTation generates mutants that complement those from general-purpose tools, exhibiting distinct behaviour under test execution and uncovering inadequacies in high-coverage test suites. We further demonstrate that PyTation produces a high proportion of unique mutants, a low cross-kill rate, and a low test overlap ratio relative to baseline tools, highlighting its novel fault model. PyTation also incurs few equivalent mutants, aided by dynamic analysis heuristics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19088v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EPAS: Efficient Training with Progressive Activation Sharing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19089</link><description>arXiv:2601.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for Efficient training with Progressive Activation Sharing (EPAS). This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19089v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privacy-Preserving Model Transcription with Differentially Private Synthetic Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19090</link><description>arXiv:2601.19090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19090v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Neural Physics Solvers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19091</link><description>arXiv:2601.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural physics solvers are increasingly used in scientific discovery, given their potential for rapid in silico insights into physical, materials, or biological systems and their long-time evolution. However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Axe: A Simple Unified Layout Abstraction for Machine Learning Compilers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19092</link><description>arXiv:2601.19092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling modern deep learning workloads demands coordinated placement of data and compute across device meshes, memory hierarchies, and heterogeneous accelerators. We present Axe Layout, a hardware-aware abstraction that maps logical tensor coordinates to a multi-axis physical space via named axes. Axe unifies tiling, sharding, replication, and offsets across inter-device distribution and on-device layouts, enabling collective primitives to be expressed consistently from device meshes to threads. Building on Axe, we design a multi-granularity, distribution-aware DSL and compiler that composes thread-local control with collective operators in a single kernel. Experiments show that our unified approach can bring performance close to hand-tuned kernels on across latest GPU devices and multi-device environments and accelerator backends.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19092v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FloydNet: A Learning Paradigm for Global Relational Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19094</link><description>arXiv:2601.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often &gt;99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19094v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dual Analysis of Continuous-time Economic Dispatch and Its Price Implications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19095</link><description>arXiv:2601.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As load varies continuously over time, it is essential to provide continuous-time price signals that accurately reflect supply-demand balance. However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations. The proposed methodology is validated on an illustrative 5-bus system and a modified IEEE RTS-2019.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19095v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PsyProbe: Proactive and Interpretable Dialogue through User State Modeling for Exploratory Counseling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19096</link><description>arXiv:2601.19096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled mental health dialogue systems, yet existing approaches remain predominantly reactive, lacking systematic user state modeling for proactive therapeutic exploration. We introduce PsyProbe, a dialogue system designed for the exploration phase of counseling that systematically tracks user psychological states through the PPPPPI framework (Presenting, Predisposing, Precipitating, Perpetuating, Protective, Impact) augmented with cognitive error detection. PsyProbe combines State Builder for extracting structured psychological profiles, Memory Construction for tracking information gaps, Strategy Planner for Motivational Interviewing behavioral codes, and Response Generator with Question Ideation and Critic/Revision modules to generate contextually appropriate, proactive questions. We evaluate PsyProbe with 27 participants in real-world Korean counseling scenarios, including automatic evaluation across ablation modes, user evaluation, and expert evaluation by a certified counselor. The full PsyProbe model consistently outperforms baseline and ablation modes in automatic evaluation. User evaluation demonstrates significantly increased engagement intention and improved naturalness compared to baseline. Expert evaluation shows that PsyProbe substantially improves core issue understanding and achieves question rates comparable to professional counselors, validating the effectiveness of systematic state modeling and proactive questioning for therapeutic exploration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19096v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SimTO: A simulation-based topology optimization framework for bespoke soft robotic grippers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19098</link><description>arXiv:2601.19098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robotic grippers are essential for grasping delicate, geometrically complex objects in manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture. However, existing grippers struggle to grasp feature-rich objects with high topological variability, including gears with sharp tooth profiles on automotive assembly lines, corals with fragile protrusions, or vegetables with irregular branching structures like broccoli. Unlike simple geometric primitives such as cubes or spheres, feature-rich objects lack a clear "optimal" contact surface, making them both difficult to grasp and susceptible to damage when grasped by existing gripper designs. Safe handling of such objects therefore requires specialized soft grippers whose morphology is tailored to the object's features. Topology optimization offers a promising approach for producing specialized grippers, but its utility is limited by the requirement for pre-defined load cases. For soft grippers interacting with feature-rich objects, these loads arise from hundreds of unpredictable gripper-object contact forces during grasping and are unknown a priori. To address this problem, we introduce SimTO, a framework that enables high-resolution topology optimization by automatically extracting load cases from a contact-based physics simulator, eliminating the need for manual load specification. Given an arbitrary feature-rich object, SimTO produces highly customized soft grippers with fine-grained morphological features tailored to the object geometry. Numerical results show our designs are not only highly specialized to feature-rich objects, but also generalize to unseen objects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19098v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] m2sv: A Scalable Benchmark for Map-to-Street-View Spatial Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19099</link><description>arXiv:2601.19099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many multimodal benchmarks but remain brittle on spatial reasoning tasks that require aligning abstract overhead representations with egocentric views. We introduce m2sv, a scalable benchmark for map-to-street-view spatial reasoning that asks models to infer camera viewing direction by aligning a north-up overhead map with a Street View image captured at the same real-world intersection. We release m2sv-20k, a geographically diverse benchmark with controlled ambiguity, along with m2sv-sft-11k, a curated set of structured reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning.
  Despite strong performance on existing multimodal benchmarks, the best evaluated VLM achieves only 65.2% accuracy on m2sv, far below the human baseline of 95%. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield consistent gains, cross-benchmark evaluations reveal limited transfer. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we systematically analyze difficulty in map-to-street-view reasoning using both structural signals and human effort, and conduct an extensive failure analysis of adapted open models. Our findings highlight persistent gaps in geometric alignment, evidence aggregation, and reasoning consistency, motivating future work on grounded spatial reasoning across viewpoints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19099v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reward Engineering for Reinforcement Learning in Software Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19100</link><description>arXiv:2601.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is increasingly used for code-centric tasks. These tasks include code generation, summarization, understanding, repair, testing, and optimization. This trend is growing faster with large language models and autonomous agents. A key challenge is how to design reward signals that make sense for software. In many RL problems, the reward is a clear number. In software, this is often not possible. The goal is rarely a single numeric objective. Instead, rewards are usually proxies. Common proxies check if the code compiles, passes tests, or satisfies quality metrics. Many reward designs have been proposed for code-related tasks. However, the work is scattered across areas and papers. There is no single survey that brings these approaches together and shows the full landscape of reward design for RL in software. In this survey, we provide the first systematic and comprehensive review of reward engineering for RL in software tasks. We focus on existing methods and techniques. We structure the literature along three complementary dimensions, summarizing the reward-design choices within each. We conclude with challenges and recommendations in the reward design space for SE tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19100v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OWLEYE: Zero-Shot Learner for Cross-Domain Graph Data Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19102</link><description>arXiv:2601.19102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph data is informative to represent complex relationships such as transactions between accounts, communications between devices, and dependencies among machines or processes. Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19102v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Glance and Focus Reinforcement for Pan-cancer Screening</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19103</link><description>arXiv:2601.19103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Detecting and Correcting Hallucinations in LLM-Generated Code via Deterministic AST Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19106</link><description>arXiv:2601.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation boost productivity but frequently introduce Knowledge Conflicting Hallucinations (KCHs), subtle, semantic errors, such as non-existent API parameters, that evade linters and cause runtime failures. Existing mitigations like constrained decoding or non-deterministic LLM-in-the-loop repair are often unreliable for these errors. This paper investigates whether a deterministic, static-analysis framework can reliably detect \textit{and} auto-correct KCHs. We propose a post-processing framework that parses generated code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and validates it against a dynamically-generated Knowledge Base (KB) built via library introspection. This non-executing approach uses deterministic rules to find and fix both API and identifier-level conflicts. On a manually-curated dataset of 200 Python snippets, our framework detected KCHs with 100\% precision and 87.6\% recall (0.934 F1-score), and successfully auto-corrected 77.0\% of all identified hallucinations. Our findings demonstrate that this deterministic post-processing approach is a viable and reliable alternative to probabilistic repair, offering a clear path toward trustworthy code generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19106v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TinyTorch: Building Machine Learning Systems from First Principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19107</link><description>arXiv:2601.19107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning systems engineering requires a deep understanding of framework internals. Yet most current education separates algorithms from systems. Students learn gradient descent without measuring memory usage, and attention mechanisms without profiling computational cost. This split leaves graduates unprepared to debug real production failures and widens the gap between machine learning research and reliable deployment. We present TinyTorch, a 20 module curriculum in which students implement the core components of PyTorch, including tensors, autograd, optimizers, and neural networks, entirely in pure Python. The curriculum is built around three pedagogical principles. Progressive disclosure gradually introduces complexity as students build confidence. Systems first integration embeds memory and performance awareness from the very beginning. Historical milestone validation guides students to recreate key breakthroughs, from the Perceptron in 1958 to modern Transformers, using only code they have written themselves. TinyTorch requires only a laptop with 4GB of RAM and no GPU, making machine learning systems education accessible worldwide. Its goal is to prepare the next generation of AI engineers, practitioners who understand not only what machine learning systems do, but why they work and how to make them scale. The curriculum is available as open source at mlsysbook.ai slash tinytorch.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19107v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpretable and Perceptually-Aligned Music Similarity with Pretrained Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19109</link><description>arXiv:2601.19109v1 Announce Type: new

To surpass this baseline, we introduce a novel method to perceptually align pretrained embeddings with source separation and linear optimization on ABX preference data from listening tests. Our model provides interpretable and controllable instrument-wise weights, allowing music producers to retrieve stem-level loops and samples based on mixed reference songs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19109v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with Emotion Prior Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19112</link><description>arXiv:2601.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

Abstract: Universal speech enhancement aims at handling inputs with various speech distortions and recording conditions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid architecture that synergizes the signal fidelity of discriminative modeling with the reconstruction capabilities of generative modeling. Our system utilizes the discriminative TF-GridNet model with the Sampling-Frequency-Independent strategy to handle variable sampling rates universally. In parallel, an autoregressive model combined with spectral mapping modeling generates detail-rich speech while effectively suppressing generative artifacts. Finally, a fusion network learns adaptive weights of the two outputs under the optimization of signal-level losses and the comprehensive Speech Quality Assessment (SQA) loss. Our proposed system is evaluated in the ICASSP 2026 URGENT Challenge (Track 1) and ranks the third place.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19113v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reg-TTR, Test-Time Refinement for Fast, Robust and Accurate Image Registration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19114</link><description>arXiv:2601.19114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional image registration methods are robust but slow due to their iterative nature. While deep learning has accelerated inference, it often struggles with domain shifts. Emerging registration foundation models offer a balance of speed and robustness, yet typically cannot match the peak accuracy of specialized models trained on specific datasets. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Reg-TTR, a test-time refinement framework that synergizes the complementary strengths of both deep learning and conventional registration techniques. By refining the predictions of pre-trained models at inference, our method delivers significantly improved registration accuracy at a modest computational cost, requiring only 21% additional inference time (0.56s). We evaluate Reg-TTR on two distinct tasks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining inference speeds close to previous deep learning methods. As foundation models continue to emerge, our framework offers an efficient strategy to narrow the performance gap between registration foundation models and SOTA methods trained on specialized datasets. The source code will be publicly available following the acceptance of this work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FBSDiff++: Improved Frequency Band Substitution of Diffusion Features for Efficient and Highly Controllable Text-Driven Image-to-Image Translation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19115</link><description>arXiv:2601.19115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieving significant advancements in open-domain image creation, increasing attention has been focused on their natural extension to the realm of text-driven image-to-image (I2I) translation, where a source image acts as visual guidance to the generated image in addition to the textual guidance provided by the text prompt. We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of FBSDiff++ in I2I translation visual quality, efficiency, versatility, and controllability compared to related advanced approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19115v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agree to Disagree: Consensus-Free Flocking under Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19119</link><description>arXiv:2601.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots sometimes have to work together with a mixture of partially-aligned or conflicting goals. Flocking - coordinated motion through cohesion, alignment, and separation - traditionally assumes uniform desired inter-agent distances. Many practical applications demand greater flexibility, as the diversity of types and configurations grows with the popularity of multi-agent systems in society. Moreover, agents often operate without guarantees of trust or secure communication. Motivated by these challenges we update well-established frameworks by relaxing this assumption of shared inter-agent distances and constraints. Through a new form of constrained collective potential function, we introduce a solution that permits negotiation of these parameters. In the spirit of the traditional flocking control canon, this negotiation is achieved purely through local observations and does not require any global information or inter-agent communication. The approach is robust to semi-trust scenarios, where neighbouring agents pursue conflicting goals. We validate the effectiveness of the approach through a series of simulations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19119v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RobustExplain: Evaluating Robustness of LLM-Based Explanation Agents for Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19120</link><description>arXiv:2601.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate natural-language explanations in recommender systems, acting as explanation agents that reason over user behavior histories. While prior work has focused on explanation fluency and relevance under fixed inputs, the robustness of LLM-generated explanations to realistic user behavior noise remains largely unexplored. In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability. Our results establish the first robustness benchmarks for explanation agents and highlight robustness as a critical dimension for trustworthy, agent-driven recommender systems at web scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19120v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMs as Orchestrators: Constraint-Compliant Multi-Agent Optimization for Recommendation Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19121</link><description>arXiv:2601.19121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems must optimize multiple objectives while satisfying hard business constraints such as fairness and coverage. For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19121v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Weaknesses in Function Call Models via Reinforcement Learning: An Adversarial Data Augmentation Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19122</link><description>arXiv:2601.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function call capabilities have become crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interact more effectively with external tools and APIs. Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19122v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging Sentence-oriented Augmentation and Transformer-Based Architecture for Vietnamese-Bahnaric Translation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19124</link><description>arXiv:2601.19124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bahnar people, an ethnic minority in Vietnam with a rich ancestral heritage, possess a language of immense cultural and historical significance. The government places a strong emphasis on preserving and promoting the Bahnaric language by making it accessible online and encouraging communication across generations. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), have brought about a transformation in translation by improving accuracy and fluency. This, in turn, contributes to the revival of the language through educational efforts, communication, and documentation. Specifically, NMT is pivotal in enhancing accessibility for Bahnaric speakers, making information and content more readily available. Nevertheless, the translation of Vietnamese into Bahnaric faces practical challenges due to resource constraints, especially given the limited resources available for the Bahnaric language. To address this, we employ state-of-the-art techniques in NMT along with two augmentation strategies for domain-specific Vietnamese-Bahnaric translation task. Importantly, both approaches are flexible and can be used with various neural machine translation models. Additionally, they do not require complex data preprocessing steps, the training of additional systems, or the acquisition of extra data beyond the existing training parallel corpora.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Entanglement Reshapes the Geometry of Quantum Differential Privacy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19126</link><description>arXiv:2601.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum differential privacy provides a rigorous framework for quantifying privacy guarantees in quantum information processing. While classical correlations are typically regarded as adversarial to privacy, the role of their quantum analogue, entanglement, is not well understood. In this work, we investigate how quantum entanglement fundamentally shapes quantum local differential privacy (QLDP). We consider a bipartite quantum system whose input state has a prescribed level of entanglement, characterized by a lower bound on the entanglement entropy. Each subsystem is then processed by a local quantum mechanism and measured using local operations only, ensuring that no additional entanglement is generated during the process. Our main result reveals a sharp phase-transition phenomenon in the relation between entanglement and QLDP: below a mechanism-dependent entropy threshold, the optimal privacy leakage level mirrors that of unentangled inputs; beyond this threshold, the privacy leakage level decreases with the entropy, which strictly improves privacy guarantees and can even turn some non-private mechanisms into private ones. The phase-transition phenomenon gives rise to a nonlinear dependence of the privacy leakage level on the entanglement entropy, even though the underlying quantum mechanisms and measurements are linear. We show that the transition is governed by the intrinsic non-convex geometry of the set of entanglement-constrained quantum states, which we parametrize as a smooth manifold and analyze via Riemannian optimization. Our findings demonstrate that entanglement serves as a genuine privacy-enhancing resource, offering a geometric and operational foundation for designing robust privacy-preserving quantum protocols.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19126v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Implicit Non-Causal Factors are Out via Dataset Splitting for Domain Generalization Object Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19127</link><description>arXiv:2601.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open world object detection faces a significant challenge in domain-invariant representation, i.e., implicit non-causal factors. Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL. Comparative experiments on numerous benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better generalization performance in novel circumstances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19127v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Resolving Primitive-Sharing Ambiguity in Long-Tailed Industrial Point Cloud Segmentation via Spatial Context Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19128</link><description>arXiv:2601.19128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial point cloud segmentation for Digital Twin construction faces a persistent challenge: safety-critical components such as reducers and valves are systematically misclassified. These failures stem from two compounding factors: such components are rare in training data, yet they share identical local geometry with dominant structures like pipes. This work identifies a dual crisis unique to industrial 3D data extreme class imbalance 215:1 ratio compounded by geometric ambiguity where most tail classes share cylindrical primitives with head classes. Existing frequency-based re-weighting methods address statistical imbalance but cannot resolve geometric ambiguity. We propose spatial context constraints that leverage neighborhood prediction consistency to disambiguate locally similar structures. Our approach extends the Class-Balanced (CB) Loss framework with two architecture-agnostic mechanisms: (1) Boundary-CB, an entropy-based constraint that emphasizes ambiguous boundaries, and (2) Density-CB, a density-based constraint that compensates for scan-dependent variations. Both integrate as plug-and-play modules without network modifications, requiring only loss function replacement. On the Industrial3D dataset (610M points from water treatment facilities), our method achieves 55.74% mIoU with 21.7% relative improvement on tail-class performance (29.59% vs. 24.32% baseline) while preserving head-class accuracy (88.14%). Components with primitive-sharing ambiguity show dramatic gains: reducer improves from 0% to 21.12% IoU; valve improves by 24.3% relative. This resolves geometric ambiguity without the typical head-tail trade-off, enabling reliable identification of safety-critical components for automated knowledge extraction in Digital Twin applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19128v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CLIP-Guided Unsupervised Semantic-Aware Exposure Correction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19129</link><description>arXiv:2601.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improper exposure often leads to severe loss of details, color distortion, and reduced contrast. Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19129v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structural Monotonicity in Transmission Scheduling for Remote State Estimation with Hidden Channel Mode</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19131</link><description>arXiv:2601.19131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study treats transmission scheduling for remote state estimation over unreliable channels with a hidden mode. A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19131v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QA-ReID: Quality-Aware Query-Adaptive Convolution Leveraging Fused Global and Structural Cues for Clothes-Changing ReID</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19133</link><description>arXiv:2601.19133v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Amazon published its Frontier Model Safety Framework (FMSF) as part of the Paris AI summit, following which we presented a report on Amazon's Premier model.

We present a comprehensive evaluation of Nova 2.0 Lite's critical risk profile under the FMSF. Evaluations target three high-risk domains-Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), Offensive Cyber Operations, and Automated AI R&amp;amp;D-and combine automated benchmarks, expert red-teaming, and uplift studies to determine whether the model exceeds release thresholds.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of retinal arteries and veins carries the diagnosis of systemic cardiovascular conditions. However, standard convolutional architectures often yield topologically disjointed segmentations, characterized by gaps and discontinuities that render reliable graph-based clinical analysis impossible despite high pixel-level accuracy. To address this, we introduce a topology-aware framework engineered to maintain vascular connectivity. Our architecture fuses a Topological Feature Fusion Module (TFFM) that maps local feature representations into a latent graph space, deploying Graph Attention Networks to capture global structural dependencies often missed by fixed receptive fields. Furthermore, we drive the learning process with a hybrid objective function, coupling Tversky loss for class imbalance with soft clDice loss to explicitly penalize topological disconnects. Evaluation on the Fundus-AVSeg dataset reveals state-of-the-art performance, achieving a combined Dice score of 90.97% and a 95% Hausdorff Distance of 3.50 pixels. Notably, our method decreases vessel fragmentation by approximately 38% relative to baselines, yielding topologically coherent vascular trees viable for automated biomarker quantification.

Abstract: Secure code review is critical at the pre-commit stage, where vulnerabilities must be caught early under tight latency and limited-context constraints. Existing SAST-based checks are noisy and often miss immature, context-dependent vulnerabilities, while standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by context windows and lack explicit tool use. Agentic AI, which combine LLMs with autonomous decision-making, tool invocation, and code navigation, offer a promising alternative, but their effectiveness for pre-commit secure code review is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce AgenticSCR, an agentic AI for secure code review for detecting immature vulnerabilities during the pre-commit stage, augmented by security-focused semantic memories. Using our own curated benchmark of immature vulnerabilities, tailored to the pre-commit secure code review, we empirically evaluate how accurate is our AgenticSCR for localizing, detecting, and explaining immature vulnerabilities. Our results show that AgenticSCR achieves at least 153% relatively higher percentage of correct code review comments than the static LLM-based baseline, and also substantially surpasses SAST tools. Moreover, AgenticSCR generates more correct comments in four out of five vulnerability types, consistently and significantly outperforming all other baselines. These findings highlight the importance of Agentic Secure Code Review, paving the way towards an emerging research area of immature vulnerability detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19138v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Native LLM and MLLM Inference at Scale on Apple Silicon</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19139</link><description>arXiv:2601.19139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19139v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Length-Adaptive Interest Network for Balancing Long and Short Sequence Modeling in CTR Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19142</link><description>arXiv:2601.19142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User behavior sequences in modern recommendation systems exhibit significant length heterogeneity, ranging from sparse short-term interactions to rich long-term histories. While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction. Notably, our method significantly improves accuracy for short-sequence users without sacrificing longsequence effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for improving the operational efficiency of automated storage systems under uncertainty. It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $\Theta(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations. Extensive experiments show that, for $k$ up to half the grid width, the proposed storage-retrieval framework essentially eliminates relocations. For $k$ values up to the full grid width, relocations are reduced by $50\%+$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19144v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Promise and Reality of Continuous Integration Caching: An Empirical Study of Travis CI Builds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19146</link><description>arXiv:2601.19146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) provides early feedback by automatically building software, but long build durations can hinder developer productivity. CI services offer caching mechanisms to speed up builds by reusing infrequently changing artifacts, yet little is known about how caching is adopted in practice and what challenges it entails. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of CI caching in Travis CI, analyzing 513,384 builds from 1,279 GitHub projects. We find that only 30% of projects adopt CI caching, and early adoption is strongly associated with project maturity, such as more dependencies, more commits, and longer CI lifespans. To understand why many projects do not adopt caching, we submitted pull requests enabling caching in non-adopting projects, and nearly half were accepted or merged. Developer feedback suggests that non- or late adoption mainly stems from limited awareness of CI caching support. We also examine cache maintenance and identify five common activities, performed by 24% of cache-enabled projects. Although one-third of projects see substantial build-time reductions, cache uploads occur in 97% of builds, and 33% of projects contain stale cached artifacts. Finally, our analysis of reported caching issues shows developers mainly struggle with corrupted or outdated caches or request broader caching features. Overall, CI caching does not help all projects, needs ongoing maintenance, and is more complex in practice than many developers expect.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal Motion Planning for Two Square Robots in a Rectilinear Environment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19147</link><description>arXiv:2601.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{W} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a rectilinear polygonal environment (that is, a rectilinear polygon potentially with holes) with a total of $n$ vertices, and let $A,B$ be two robots, each modeled as an axis-aligned unit square, that can move rectilinearly inside $\mathcal{W}$. The goal is to compute a collision-free motion plan $\boldsymbol{\pi}$, that is, a motion plan that continuously moves $A$ from $s_A$ to $t_A$ and $B$ from $s_B$ to $t_B$ so that $A$ and $B$ remain inside $\mathcal{W}$ and do not collide with each other during the motion. We study two variants of this problem which are focused additionally on the optimality of $\boldsymbol{\pi}$, and obtain the following results.
  1. Min-Sum: Here the goal is to compute a motion plan that minimizes the sum of the lengths of the paths of the robots. We present an $O(n^4\log{n})$-time algorithm for computing an optimal solution to the min-sum problem. This is the first polynomial-time algorithm to compute an optimal, collision-free motion of two robots amid obstacles in a planar polygonal environment.
  2. Min-Makespan: Here the robots can move with at most unit speed, and the goal is to compute a motion plan that minimizes the maximum time taken by a robot to reach its target location. We prove that the min-makespan variant is NP-hard.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19147v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GPCR-Filter: a deep learning framework for efficient and precise GPCR modulator discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19149</link><description>arXiv:2601.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) govern diverse physiological processes and are central to modern pharmacology. Yet discovering GPCR modulators remains challenging because receptor activation often arises from complex allosteric effects rather than direct binding affinity, and conventional assays are slow, costly, and not optimized for capturing these dynamics. Here we present GPCR-Filter, a deep learning framework specifically developed for GPCR modulator discovery. We assembled a high-quality dataset of over 90,000 experimentally validated GPCR-ligand pairs, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluation. GPCR-Filter integrates the ESM-3 protein language model for high-fidelity GPCR sequence representations with graph neural networks that encode ligand structures, coupled through an attention-based fusion mechanism that learns receptor-ligand functional relationships. Across multiple evaluation settings, GPCR-Filter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compound-protein interaction models and exhibits strong generalization to unseen receptors and ligands. Notably, the model successfully identified micromolar-level agonists of the 5-HT\textsubscript{1A} receptor with distinct chemical frameworks. These results establish GPCR-Filter as a scalable and effective computational approach for GPCR modulator discovery, advancing AI-assisted drug development for complex signaling systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19149v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TS-Debate: Multimodal Collaborative Debate for Zero-Shot Time Series Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19151</link><description>arXiv:2601.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning. Across 20 tasks spanning three public benchmarks, TS-Debate achieves consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including standard multimodal debate in which all agents observe all inputs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analysis of Shuffling Beyond Pure Local Differential Privacy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19154</link><description>arXiv:2601.19154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shuffling is a powerful way to amplify privacy of a local randomizer in private distributed data analysis, but existing analyses mostly treat the local differential privacy (DP) parameter $\varepsilon_0$ as the only knob and give generic upper bounds that can be loose and do not even characterize how shuffling amplifies privacy for basic mechanisms such as the Gaussian mechanism. We revisit the privacy blanket bound of Balle et al. (the blanket divergence) and develop an asymptotic analysis that applies to a broad class of local randomizers under mild regularity assumptions, without requiring pure local DP. Our key finding is that the leading term of the blanket divergence depends on the local mechanism only through a single scalar parameter $\chi$, which we call the shuffle index. By applying this asymptotic analysis to both upper and lower bounds, we obtain a tight band for $\delta_n$ in the shuffled mechanism's $(\varepsilon_n,\delta_n)$-DP guarantee. Moreover, we derive a simple structural necessary and sufficient condition on the local randomizer under which the blanket-divergence-based upper and lower bounds coincide asymptotically. $k$-RR families with $k\ge3$ satisfy this condition, while for generalized Gaussian mechanisms the condition may not hold but the resulting band remains tight. Finally, we complement the asymptotic theory with an FFT-based algorithm for computing the blanket divergence at finite $n$, which offers rigorously controlled relative error and near-linear running time in $n$, providing a practical numerical analysis for shuffle DP.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19154v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LocationAgent: A Hierarchical Agent for Image Geolocation via Decoupling Strategy and Evidence from Parametric Knowledge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19155</link><description>arXiv:2601.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image geolocation aims to infer capture locations based on visual content. Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LocationAgent significantly outperforms existing methods by at least 30\% in zero-shot settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19155v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating Generative Recommendation via Simple Categorical User Sequence Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19158</link><description>arXiv:2601.19158v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: FaaS platforms rely on cluster managers like Kubernetes for resource management. Kubernetes is popular due to its state-centric APIs that decouple the control plane into modular controllers. However, to scale out a burst of FaaS instances, message passing becomes the primary bottleneck as controllers have to exchange extensive state through the API Server. Existing solutions opt for a clean-slate redesign of cluster managers, but at the expense of compatibility with existing ecosystem and substantial engineering effort.
  We present KUBEDIRECT, a Kubernetes-based cluster manager for FaaS. We find that there exists a common narrow waist across FaaS platform that allows us to achieve both efficiency and external compatibility. Our insight is that the sequential structure of the narrow waist obviates the need for a single source of truth, allowing us to bypass the API Server and perform direct message passing for efficiency. However, our approach introduces a set of ephemeral states across controllers, making it challenging to enforce end-to-end semantics due to the absence of centralized coordination. KUBEDIRECT employs a novel state management scheme that leverages the narrow waist as a hierarchical write-back cache, ensuring consistency and convergence to the desired state. KUBEDIRECT can seamlessly integrate with Kubernetes, adding ~150 LoC per controller. Experiments show that KUBEDIRECT reduces serving latency by 26.7x over Knative, and has similar performance as the state-of-the-art clean-slate platform Dirigent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19160v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Educational Database Prototype: the Simplest of All</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19165</link><description>arXiv:2601.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Database Management System (DBMS) is designed to help store and process large collections of data, and is incredibly flexible to perform various kinds of optimizations as long as it achieves serializability with a high-level interface available. The current undergraduate level DBMS course in UW-Madison (i.e., CS564) involves implementing specific modules of DB architecture, including B+ tree, but students may end up spending numerous amounts of effort on corner cases and not gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the internal design. Thus, we present EduDB, a simple database prototype for educational purposes that provides students a clean, concise, and comprehensive overview of the database system. We also attempt to develop an integrative series of course projects based on EduDB, which offers a platform for students to perform any optimization learned during the semester.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19165v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nonvisual Support for Understanding and Reasoning about Data Structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19168</link><description>arXiv:2601.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind and visually impaired (BVI) computer science students face systematic barriers when learning data structures: current accessibility approaches typically translate diagrams into alternative text, focusing on visual appearance rather than preserving the underlying structure essential for conceptual understanding. More accessible alternatives often do not scale in complexity, cost to produce, or both. Motivated by a recent shift to tools for creating visual diagrams from code, we propose a solution that automatically creates accessible representations from structural information about diagrams. Based on a Wizard-of-Oz study, we derive design requirements for an automated system, Arboretum, that compiles text-based diagram specifications into three synchronized nonvisual formats$\unicode{x2013}$tabular, navigable, and tactile. Our evaluation with BVI users highlights the strength of tactile graphics for complex tasks such as binary search; the benefits of offering multiple, complementary nonvisual representations; and limitations of existing digital navigation patterns for structural reasoning. This work reframes access to data structures by preserving their structural properties. The solution is a practical system to advance accessible CS education.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19168v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Procedural Graph Extraction with Structural and Logical Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19170</link><description>arXiv:2601.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically extracting workflows as procedural graphs from natural language is promising yet underexplored, demanding both structural validity and logical alignment. While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19170v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Gulfs in UI Generation through Semantic Guidance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19171</link><description>arXiv:2601.19171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While generative AI enables high-fidelity UI generation from text prompts, users struggle to articulate design intent and evaluate or refine results-creating gulfs of execution and evaluation. To understand the information needed for UI generation, we conducted a thematic analysis of UI prompting guidelines, identifying key design semantics and discovering that they are hierarchical and interdependent. Leveraging these findings, we developed a system that enables users to specify semantics, visualize relationships, and extract how semantics are reflected in generated UIs. By making semantics serve as an intermediate representation between human intent and AI output, our system bridges both gulfs by making requirements explicit and outcomes interpretable. A comparative user study suggests that our approach enhances users' perceived control over intent expression, outcome interpretation, and facilitates more predictable, iterative refinement. Our work demonstrates how explicit semantic representation enables systematic and explainable exploration of design possibilities in AI-driven UI design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19171v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SHIELD: An Auto-Healing Agentic Defense Framework for LLM Resource Exhaustion Attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19174</link><description>arXiv:2601.19174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sponge attacks increasingly threaten LLM systems by inducing excessive computation and DoS.

We introduce SHIELD, a multi-agent, auto-healing defense framework centered on a three-stage Defense Agent that integrates semantic similarity retrieval, pattern matching, and LLM-based reasoning. Two auxiliary agents, a Knowledge Updating Agent and a Prompt Optimization Agent, form a closed self-healing loop, when an attack bypasses detection, the system updates an evolving knowledgebase, and refines defense instructions. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD consistently outperforms perplexity-based and standalone LLM defenses, achieving high F1 scores across both non-semantic and semantic sponge attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of agentic self-healing against evolving resource-exhaustion threats.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19174v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Scalable Inter-edge Correlation Modeling in CopulaGNN for Link Sign Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19175</link><description>arXiv:2601.19175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19175v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Create Benchmarks for Data Lakes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19176</link><description>arXiv:2601.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data lakes have emerged as a flexible and scalable solution for storing and analyzing large volumes of heterogeneous data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured formats. Despite their growing adoption in both industry and academia, there is a lack of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the performance of data lake systems. Existing benchmarks primarily target traditional data warehouses and focus on structured SQL workloads, making them insufficient for capturing the diverse workloads and access patterns typical of data lakes.
  In this work, we propose a new benchmarking framework for data lakes that aims to provide an objective and comparative evaluation of different data lake implementations. Our benchmark covers multiple data types and workload models, including data retrieval, aggregation, querying, and similarity search, which is a common yet underexplored operation in existing benchmarks. We measure key performance metrics such as query execution time, metadata generation time, and metadata size across different scale factors. The benchmark is designed to be extensible and reproducible, enabling users to generate datasets and evaluate data lake systems under realistic and diverse scenarios. We conduct our experiments on CloudLab and demonstrate how the proposed benchmark can be used to compare both commercial and open-source data lake platforms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19176v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CollectiveKV: Decoupling and Sharing Collaborative Information in Sequential Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19178</link><description>arXiv:2601.19178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19178v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Ordered Representations in Latent Space for Intrinsic Dimension Estimation via Principal Component Autoencoder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19179</link><description>arXiv:2601.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoencoders have long been considered a nonlinear extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint. This design serves as a natural generalization of PCA, enabling the model to preserve key advantages, such as ordered representations and variance retention, while remaining effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19179v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SNR-Edit: Structure-Aware Noise Rectification for Inversion-Free Flow-Based Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19180</link><description>arXiv:2601.19180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inversion-free image editing using flow-based generative models challenges the prevailing inversion-based pipelines. However, existing approaches rely on fixed Gaussian noise to construct the source trajectory, leading to biased trajectory dynamics and causing structural degradation or quality loss. To address this, we introduce SNR-Edit, a training-free framework achieving faithful Latent Trajectory Correction via adaptive noise control. Mechanistically, SNR-Edit uses structure-aware noise rectification to inject segmentation constraints into the initial noise, anchoring the stochastic component of the source trajectory to the real image's implicit inversion position and reducing trajectory drift during source--target transport. This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion. Across SD3 and FLUX, evaluations on PIE-Bench and SNR-Bench show that SNR-Edit delivers performance on pixel-level metrics and VLM-based scoring, while adding only about 1s overhead per image.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19180v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Information-Theoretic Secure Aggregation over Regular Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19183</link><description>arXiv:2601.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale decentralized learning frameworks such as federated learning (FL), require both communication efficiency and strong data security, motivating the study of secure aggregation (SA). While information-theoretic SA is well understood in centralized and fully connected networks, its extension to decentralized networks with limited local connectivity remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces \emph{topological secure aggregation} (TSA), which studies one-shot, information-theoretically secure aggregation of neighboring users' inputs over arbitrary network topologies. We develop a unified linear design framework that characterizes TSA achievability through the spectral properties of the communication graph, specifically the kernel of a diagonally modulated adjacency matrix. For several representative classes of $d$-regular graphs including ring, prism and complete topologies, we establish the optimal communication and secret key rate region. In particular, to securely compute one symbol of the neighborhood sum, each user must (i) store at least one key symbol, (ii) broadcast at least one message symbol, and (iii) collectively, all users must hold at least $d$ i.i.d. key symbols. Notably, this total key requirement depends only on the \emph{neighborhood size} $d$, independent of the network size, revealing a fundamental limit of SA in decentralized networks with limited local connectivity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19183v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Foresight Learning for SEC Risk Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19189</link><description>arXiv:2601.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk disclosures in SEC filings describe potential adverse events but rarely quantify their likelihood, limiting their usefulness for probabilistic analysis. A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.
  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.
  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.
  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.
  To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.

Abstract: We introduce TeMLM, a set of transparency-first release artifacts for clinical language models. TeMLM unifies provenance, data transparency, modeling transparency, and governance into a single, machine-checkable release bundle. We define an artifact suite (TeMLM-Card, TeMLM-Datasheet, TeMLM-Provenance) and a lightweight conformance checklist for repeatable auditing. We instantiate the artifacts on Technetium-I, a large-scale synthetic clinical NLP dataset with 498,000 notes, 7.74M PHI entity annotations across 10 types, and ICD-9-CM diagnosis labels, and report reference results for ProtactiniumBERT (about 100 million parameters) on PHI de-identification (token classification) and top-50 ICD-9 code extraction (multi-label classification). We emphasize that synthetic benchmarks are valuable for tooling and process validation, but models should be validated on real clinical data prior to deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19191v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoReTab: Improving Multimodal Table Understanding with Code-driven Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19193</link><description>arXiv:2601.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19193v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HELM: A Human-Centered Evaluation Framework for LLM-Powered Recommender Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19197</link><description>arXiv:2601.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommendation systems has introduced unprecedented capabilities for natural language understanding, explanation generation, and conversational interactions. However, existing evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on traditional accuracy metrics, failing to capture the multifaceted human-centered qualities that determine the real-world user experience. We introduce \framework{} (\textbf{H}uman-centered \textbf{E}valuation for \textbf{L}LM-powered reco\textbf{M}menders), a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses LLM-powered recommender systems across five human-centered dimensions: \textit{Intent Alignment}, \textit{Explanation Quality}, \textit{Interaction Naturalness}, \textit{Trust \&amp; Transparency}, and \textit{Fairness \&amp; Diversity}. Through extensive experiments involving three state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders (GPT-4, LLaMA-3.1, and P5) across three domains (movies, books, and restaurants), and rigorous evaluation by 12 domain experts using 847 recommendation scenarios, we demonstrate that \framework{} reveals critical quality dimensions invisible to traditional metrics. Our results show that while GPT-4 achieves superior explanation quality (4.21/5.0) and interaction naturalness (4.35/5.0), it exhibits a significant popularity bias (Gini coefficient 0.73) compared to traditional collaborative filtering (0.58). We release \framework{} as an open-source toolkit to advance human-centered evaluation practices in the recommender systems community.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19197v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Propagating Similarity, Mitigating Uncertainty: Similarity Propagation-enhanced Uncertainty for Multimodal Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19198</link><description>arXiv:2601.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Recommendation (MMR) systems are crucial for modern platforms but are often hampered by inherent noise and uncertainty in modal features, such as blurry images, diverse visual appearances, or ambiguous text. Existing methods often overlook this modality-specific uncertainty, leading to ineffective feature fusion. Furthermore, they fail to leverage rich similarity patterns among users and items to refine representations and their corresponding uncertainty estimates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Similarity Propagation-enhanced Uncertainty for Multimodal Recommendation (SPUMR). SPUMR explicitly models and mitigates uncertainty by first constructing the Modality Similarity Graph and the Collaborative Similarity Graph to refine representations from both content and behavioral perspectives. The Uncertainty-aware Preference Aggregation module then adaptively fuses the refined multimodal features, assigning greater weight to more reliable modalities. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPUMR achieves significant improvements over existing leading methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19198v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MAGNET: Towards Adaptive GUI Agents with Memory-Driven Knowledge Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19199</link><description>arXiv:2601.19199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile GUI agents powered by large foundation models enable autonomous task execution, but frequent updates altering UI appearance and reorganizing workflows cause agents trained on historical data to fail. Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows. We propose a dynamic memory evolution mechanism that continuously refines both memories by prioritizing frequently accessed knowledge. Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19199v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Images Speak Louder than Words?

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on Visual-Question-Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, their robustness against textual misinformation remains under-explored. While existing research has studied the effect of misinformation in text-only domains, it is not clear how VLMs arbitrate between contradictory information from different modalities. To bridge the gap, we first propose the CONTEXT-VQA (i.e., Conflicting Text) dataset, consisting of image-question pairs together with systematically generated persuasive prompts that deliberately conflict with visual evidence. Then, a thorough evaluation framework is designed and executed to benchmark the susceptibility of various models to these conflicting multimodal inputs. Comprehensive experiments over 11 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that these models are indeed vulnerable to misleading textual prompts, often overriding clear visual evidence in favor of the conflicting text, and show an average performance drop of over 48.2% after only one round of persuasive conversation. Our findings highlight a critical limitation in current VLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against textual manipulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19202v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Before Smelling the Video: A Two-Stage Pipeline for Interpretable Video-to-Scent Plans</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19203</link><description>arXiv:2601.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Olfactory cues can enhance immersion in interactive media, yet smell remains rare because it is difficult to author and synchronize with dynamic video. Prior olfactory interfaces rely on designer triggers and fixed event-to-odor mappings that do not scale to unconstrained content. This work examines whether semantic planning for smell is intelligible to people before physical scent delivery. We present a video-to-scent planning pipeline that separates visual semantic extraction using a vision-language model from semantic-to-olfactory inference using a large language model. Two survey studies compare system-generated scent plans with over-inclusive and naive baselines. Results show consistent preference for plans that prioritize perceptually salient cues and align scent changes with visible actions, supporting semantic planning as a foundation for future olfactory media systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19203v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MATA: A Trainable Hierarchical Automaton System for Multi-Agent Visual Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19204</link><description>arXiv:2601.19204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent vision-language models have strong perceptual ability but their implicit reasoning is hard to explain and easily generates hallucinations on complex queries. Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ControlNet/MATA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19204v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Refactoring and Equivalence in Rust: Expanding the REM Toolchain with a Novel Approach to Automated Equivalence Proofs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19207</link><description>arXiv:2601.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refactoring tools are central to modern development, with extract-function refactorings used heavily in day-to-day work. For Rust, however, ownership, borrowing, and advanced type features make automated extract-function refactoring challenging. Existing tools either rely on slow compiler-based analysis, support only restricted language fragments, or provide little assurance beyond "it still compiles." This paper presents REM2.0, a new extract-function and verification toolchain for Rust. REM2.0 works atop rust-analyzer as a persistent daemon, providing low-latency refactorings with a VSCode front-end. It adds a repairer that automatically adjusts lifetimes and signatures when extraction exposes borrow-checker issues, and an optional verification pipeline connecting to CHARON and AENEAS to generate Coq equivalence proofs for a supported Rust subset. The architecture is evaluated on three benchmark suites. On the original REM artefact, REM2.0 achieves 100% compatibility while reducing latency from ~1000ms to single-digit milliseconds in the daemon. On 40 feature-focused extractions from 20 highly starred GitHub repositories, REM2.0 handles most examples involving async/await, const fn, non-local control flow, generics, and higher-ranked trait bounds. On twenty verification benchmarks, the CHARON/AENEAS pipeline constructs end-to-end equivalence proofs for cases within its current subset. Overall, results show that a rust-analyzer-based design can provide fast, feature-rich extract-function refactoring for real Rust programs, while opt-in verification delivers machine-checked behaviour preservation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Do Transformers Learn to Associate Tokens: Gradient Leading Terms Bring Mechanistic Interpretability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19208</link><description>arXiv:2601.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic associations such as the link between "bird" and "flew" are foundational for language modeling as they enable models to go beyond memorization and instead generalize and generate coherent text. Understanding how these associations are learned and represented in language models is essential for connecting deep learning with linguistic theory and developing a mechanistic foundation for large language models. In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions. Experiments on real-world LLMs demonstrate that our theoretical weight characterizations closely match the learned weights, and qualitative analyses further show how our theorem shines light on interpreting the learned associations in transformers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19208v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Contrastive Spectral Rectification: Test-Time Defense towards Zero-shot Adversarial Robustness of CLIP</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19210</link><description>arXiv:2601.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization, yet remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks.

Abstract: Existing low-bit Microscaling (MX) formats, such as MXFP4, often suffer from substantial accuracy degradation due to the use of a shared scaling factor with the Power-of-Two format. In this work, we explore strategies that introduce minimal metadata to recover accuracy lost during quantization while maintaining high bit efficiency across a wide range of large language models. We propose a complete algorithm-hardware co-design based on flexible metadata, featuring an online quantization with simple encoding. To support the proposed method efficiently, we implement a lightweight hardware unit and integrate it into the accelerator. Evaluation results demonstrate that our method substantially narrows the accuracy gap, achieving on average a 70.63% reduction in accuracy loss compared to MXFP4 and a 37.30% reduction relative to the latest NVFP4 on LLM benchmarks. Furthermore, our design delivers up to 1.91$\times$ speedup and 1.75$\times$ energy savings over state-of-the-art accelerators.

Abstract: Extracting actionable suggestions from customer reviews is essential for operational decision-making, yet these directives are often embedded within mixed-intent, unstructured text. Existing approaches either classify suggestion-bearing sentences or generate high-level summaries, but rarely isolate the precise improvement instructions businesses need. We evaluate a hybrid pipeline combining a high-recall RoBERTa classifier trained with a precision-recall surrogate to reduce unrecoverable false negatives with a controlled, instruction-tuned LLM for suggestion extraction, categorization, clustering, and summarization. Across real-world hospitality and food datasets, the hybrid system outperforms prompt-only, rule-based, and classifier-only baselines in extraction accuracy and cluster coherence. Human evaluations further confirm that the resulting suggestions and summaries are clear, faithful, and interpretable. Overall, our results show that hybrid reasoning architectures achieve meaningful improvements fine-grained actionable suggestion mining while highlighting challenges in domain adaptation and efficient local deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19214v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Visual and Wireless Sensing: A Unified Radiation Field for 3D Radio Map Construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19216</link><description>arXiv:2601.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging applications of next-generation wireless networks (e.g., immersive 3D communication, low-altitude networks, and integrated sensing and communication) necessitate high-fidelity environmental intelligence. 3D radio maps have emerged as a critical tool for this purpose, enabling spectrum-aware planning and environment-aware sensing by bridging the gap between physical environments and electromagnetic signal propagation. However, constructing accurate 3D radio maps requires fine-grained 3D geometric information and a profound understanding of electromagnetic wave propagation. Existing approaches typically treat optical and wireless knowledge as distinct modalities, failing to exploit the fundamental physical principles governing both light and electromagnetic propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose URF-GS, a unified radio-optical radiation field representation framework for accurate and generalizable 3D radio map construction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) and inverse rendering. By fusing visual and wireless sensing observations, URF-GS recovers scene geometry and material properties while accurately predicting radio signal behavior at arbitrary transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that URF-GS achieves up to a 24.7% improvement in spatial spectrum prediction accuracy and a 10x increase in sample efficiency for 3D radio map construction compared with neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods. This work establishes a foundation for next-generation wireless networks by integrating perception, interaction, and communication through holistic radiation field reconstruction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19216v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SE Journals in 2036: Looking Back at the Future We Need to Have</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19217</link><description>arXiv:2601.19217v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We study multi-objective optimization over probability distributions in Wasserstein space. Recently, Nguyen et al.

Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\sqrt{\beta}t}) for $\beta$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting. We further introduce a practical kernel-based discretization for A-MWGraD and demonstrate through numerical experiments that it consistently outperforms MWGraD in convergence speed and sampling efficiency on multi-target sampling tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19220v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DREAMSTATE: Diffusing States and Parameters for Recurrent Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19221</link><description>arXiv:2601.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as RWKV, are distinguished by their powerful short-range modeling capabilities and efficient fixed-size states, which constitute a core advantage over standard Transformers. However, there is a significant lack of research into their internal state as an editable knowledge representation. To fill this gap, we first explore the representational properties of the RWKV state by proposing the DREAMSTATE framework. This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility. Our work not only opens a new research direction for RNN state representation but also provides a concrete architectural reference for future model design.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for general industrial quality inspection, but fall short in complex scenarios, such as Printed Circuit Board (PCB) inspection. PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis. We will release the instruction data, benchmark, and model to facilitate future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19222v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Movable-Antenna Empowered Backscatter ISAC: Toward Geometry-Adaptive, Low-Power Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19224</link><description>arXiv:2601.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter-based integrated sensing and communication (B-ISAC) elevates passive tags into information-bearing scatterers, offering an ultra-low-power path toward dual-function wireless systems. However, this promise is fundamentally undermined by a cascaded backscattering link that suffers from severe double fading and is exquisitely sensitive to geometric misalignment. This article tackles this geometric bottleneck by integrating movable antenna systems (MAS) at the transceiver side. MAS provides real-time, controllable spatial degrees of freedom through sub-wavelength antenna repositioning, enabling active reconfiguration of the cascaded channel without modifying passive tags or consuming additional spectrum. We position this solution within a unified ISAC-backscatter communication-B-ISAC evolution, describe the resulting MAS-assisted B-ISAC architecture and operating principles, and demonstrate its system-level gains through comparative analysis and numerical results. Finally, we showcase the potential of this geometry-adaptive paradigm across key IoT application scenarios, pointing toward future motion-aware wireless networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19224v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RPO-RAG: Aligning Small LLMs with Relation-aware Preference Optimization for Knowledge Graph Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19225</link><description>arXiv:2601.19225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet hallucinate on knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19225v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Pixel-Level VLM Perception via Simple Points Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19228</link><description>arXiv:2601.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SimpleSeg, a strikingly simple yet highly effective approach to endow Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with native pixel-level perception. Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs. This work lays out that precise spatial understanding can emerge from simple point prediction, challenging the prevailing need for auxiliary components and paving the way for more unified and capable VLMs. Homepage: https://simpleseg.github.io/</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMs Can Unlearn Refusal with Only 1,000 Benign Samples</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19231</link><description>arXiv:2601.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reveals a previously unexplored vulnerability in the safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing aligned LLMs predominantly respond to unsafe queries with refusals, which often begin with a fixed set of prefixes (I'm sorry). We demonstrate that this rigid refusal pattern is a vulnerability and introduce a novel \textbf{refusal unlearning} technique that exploits it. Specifically, we fine-tune LLMs using merely 1,000 benign samples, where each response is prepended with a refusal prefix. The underlying intuition is to disrupt the refusal completion pathway, thereby driving the model to forget how to refuse while following harmful instructions. This intuition is further supported by theoretical proofs. We apply this approach to a total of 16 LLMs, including various open-source models from Llama, Qwen, and Gemma families, as well as closed-source models such as Gemini and GPT. Experimental results show that the safety scores of previously aligned LLMs degrade both consistently and substantially. Importantly, we verify that the observed gain cannot be attributed to plain fine-tuning or random prefix effects. Our findings suggest that current safety alignment may rely heavily on token sequence memorization rather than reasoning, motivating future work beyond simple refusal mechanisms.

Abstract: RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19232v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniMGS: Unifying Mesh and 3D Gaussian Splatting with Single-Pass Rasterization and Proxy-Based Deformation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19233</link><description>arXiv:2601.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint rendering and deformation of mesh and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significant value as both representa tions offer complementary advantages for graphics applica tions. However, due to differences in representation and ren dering pipelines, existing studies render meshes and 3DGS separately, making it difficult to accurately handle occlusions and transparency. Moreover, the deformed 3DGS still suffers from visual artifacts due to the sensitivity to the topology quality of the proxy mesh. These issues pose serious obsta cles to the joint use of 3DGS and meshes, making it diffi cult to adapt 3DGS to conventional mesh-oriented graphics pipelines. We propose UniMGS, the first unified framework for rasterizing mesh and 3DGS in a single-pass anti-aliased manner, with a novel binding strategy for 3DGS deformation based on proxy mesh. Our key insight is to blend the col ors of both triangle and Gaussian fragments by anti-aliased {\alpha}-blending in a single pass, achieving visually coherent re sults with precise handling of occlusion and transparency. To improve the visual appearance of the deformed 3DGS, our Gaussian-centric binding strategy employs a proxy mesh and spatially associates Gaussians with the mesh faces, signifi cantly reducing rendering artifacts. With these two compo nents, UniMGS enables the visualization and manipulation of 3D objects represented by mesh or 3DGS within a unified framework, opening up new possibilities in embodied AI, vir tual reality, and gaming. We will release our source code to facilitate future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19233v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] iFAN Ecosystem: A Unified AI, Digital Twin, Cyber-Physical Security, and Robotics Environment for Advanced Nuclear Simulation and Operations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19234</link><description>arXiv:2601.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As nuclear facilities experience digital transformation and advanced reactor development, AI integration, cyber-physical security, and other emerging technologies such as autonomous robot operations are increasingly developed. However, evaluation and deployment is challenged by the lack of dedicated virtual testbeds. The Immersive Framework for Advanced Nuclear (iFAN) ecosystem is developed, a comprehensive digital twin framework with a realistic 3D environment with physics-based simulations. The iFAN ecosystem serves as a high-fidelity virtual testbed for plant operation, cybersecurity, physical security, and robotic operation, as it provides real-time data exchange for pre-deployment verification. Core features include virtual reality, reinforcement learning, radiation simulation, and cyber-physical security. In addition, the paper investigates various applications through potential operational scenarios. The iFAN ecosystem provides a versatile and secure architecture for validating the next generation of autonomous and cyber-resilient nuclear operations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19234v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VC-Bench: Pioneering the Video Connecting Benchmark with a Dataset and Evaluation Metrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19236</link><description>arXiv:2601.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While current video generation focuses on text or image conditions, practical applications like video editing and vlogging often need to seamlessly connect separate clips. In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity. We expect that VC-Bench will serve as a pioneering benchmark to inspire and guide future research in video connecting.

Abstract: Formal representations of the visualization design space, such as knowledge bases and graphs, consolidate design practices into a shared resource and enable automated reasoning and interpretable design recommendations. However, prior approaches typically depend on fixed, manually authored rules, making it difficult to build novel representations or extend them for different visualization domains. Instead, we propose data-driven methods that automatically synthesize visualization design knowledge bases. Specifically, our methods (1) extract candidate design features from a visualization corpus, (2) select features forward and backward, and (3) render the final knowledge base. In our benchmark evaluation compared to Draco 2, our synthesized knowledge base offers general and interpretable design features and improves the accuracy of predicting effective designs by 1-15% in varied training and test sets. When we apply our approach to genomics visualization, the synthesized knowledge base includes sensible features with accuracy up to 97%, demonstrating the applicability of our approach to other visualization domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19237v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Hybrid BLE-Wi-Fi Communication Architecture for Adaptive Imaging in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19238</link><description>arXiv:2601.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is fundamentally constrained by limited wireless bandwidth, resulting in low imaging resolution and frame rate, which can cause motion blur and missed lesions. Although adaptive frame-rate schemes have been explored to accommodate transient gastrointestinal (GI) motility, these approaches typically require sacrificing image resolution. The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions. Experimental results show that the switching latency from BLE to WiFi is approximately 92.66 ms, which is longer than the WiFi-to-BLE switching latency of 15.49 ms when transmitting 10 kB image payloads. Overall, the proposed hybrid BLE and WiFi system enables robust, lossless, and energy-efficient mode switching, supports adaptive imaging, and advances the development of next-generation autonomous WCE platforms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19238v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-based Vulnerability Detection at Project Scale: An Empirical Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19239</link><description>arXiv:2601.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of specialized LLM-based detectors and compare them with traditional static analyzers at the project scale. Specifically, our study evaluates five latest and representative LLM-based methods and two traditional tools using: 1) an in-house benchmark of 222 known real-world vulnerabilities (C/C++ and Java) to assess detection capability, and 2) 24 active open-source projects, where we manually inspected 385 warnings to assess their practical usability and underlying root causes of failures. Our evaluation yields three key findings: First, while LLM-based detectors exhibit low recall on the in-house benchmark, they still uncover more unique vulnerabilities than traditional tools. Second, in open-source projects, both LLM-based and traditional tools generate substantial warnings but suffer from very high false discovery rates, hindering practical use. Our manual analysis further reveals shallow interprocedural reasoning and misidentified source/sink pairs as primary failure causes, with LLM-based tools exhibiting additional unique failures. Finally, LLM-based methods incurs substantial computational costs-hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of tokens and multi-hour to multi-day runtimes. Overall, our findings underscore critical limitations in the robustness, reliability, and scalability of current LLM-based detectors. We ultimately summarize a set of implications for future research toward more effective and practical project-scale vulnerability detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19239v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reevaluating Bluetooth Low Energy for Ingestible Electronics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19241</link><description>arXiv:2601.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been widely adopted in wearable devices; however, it has not been widely used in ingestible electronics, primarily due to concerns regarding severe tissue attenuation at the 2.4 GHz band. In this work, we systematically reevaluate the feasibility of BLE for ingestible applications by benchmarking its performance against representative sub-GHz communication schemes across power consumption, throughput, tissue-induced attenuation, latency, and system-level integration constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating an RF amplifier enables BLE to maintain robust communication links through tissue-mimicking media while preserving favorable energy efficiency. We further quantify the relationship between throughput and energy consumption over a wide operating range and demonstrate that, for the majority of ingestible sensing applications with throughput requirements below 100 kbps, BLE achieves substantially lower power consumption than sub-GHz alternatives. End-to-end latency measurements show that BLE offers significantly lower latency than sub-GHz solutions due to its native compatibility with modern computing infrastructure. Finally, we analyze antenna form factor and ecosystem integration, highlighting the mechanical and translational advantages of BLE in ingestible system design. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BLE, when appropriately configured, represents a compelling and scalable wireless communication solution for next-generation ingestible electronics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19241v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Contrast-Source-Based Physics-Driven Neural Network for Inverse Scattering Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19243</link><description>arXiv:2601.19243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been applied to inverse scattering problems (ISPs) due to their strong nonlinear mapping capabilities. However, supervised DNN solvers require large-scale datasets, which limits their generalization in practical applications. Untrained neural networks (UNNs) address this issue by updating weights from measured electric fields and prior physical knowledge, but existing UNN solvers suffer from long inference time. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a contrast-source-based physics-driven neural network (CSPDNN), which predicts the induced current distribution to improve efficiency and incorporates an adaptive total variation loss for robust reconstruction under varying contrast and noise conditions. The improved imaging performance is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19243v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Informed Neuro-Symbolic Recommender System: A Dual-Physics Approach for Personalized Nutrition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19244</link><description>arXiv:2601.19244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional e-commerce recommender systems primarily optimize for user engagement and purchase likelihood, often neglecting the rigid physiological constraints required for human health. Standard collaborative filtering algorithms are structurally blind to these hard limits, frequently suggesting bundles that fail to meet specific total daily energy expenditure and macronutrient balance requirements. To address this disconnect, this paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neuro-Symbolic Recommender System that integrates nutritional science directly into the recommendation pipeline via a dual-layer architecture. The framework begins by constructing a semantic knowledge graph using sentence-level encoders to strictly align commercial products with authoritative nutritional data. During the training phase, an implicit physics regularizer applies a differentiable thermodynamic loss function, ensuring that learned latent embeddings reflect nutritional plausibility rather than simple popularity. Subsequently, during the inference phase, an explicit physics optimizer employs simulated annealing and elastic quantity optimization to generate discrete grocery bundles that strictly adhere to the user's protein and caloric targets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19244v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond In-Domain Detection: SpikeScore for Cross-Domain Hallucination Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19245</link><description>arXiv:2601.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19245v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TIGaussian: Disentangle Gaussians for Spatial-Awared Text-Image-3D Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19247</link><description>arXiv:2601.19247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While visual-language models have profoundly linked features between texts and images, the incorporation of 3D modality data, such as point clouds and 3D Gaussians, further enables pretraining for 3D-related tasks, e.g., cross-modal retrieval, zero-shot classification, and scene recognition. As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TIGaussian in multiple tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19247v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GLOVE: Global Verifier for LLM Memory-Environment Realignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19249</link><description>arXiv:2601.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing memory-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) approaches implicitly assume that memory validity can be established either through external evaluators that provide task-specific success signals or through internal model cognition, such as reflection, for editing memory entries. However, these assumptions often break down in practical environments with dynamic drifts. We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19249v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-Assisted Logic Rule Learning: Scaling Human Expertise for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19255</link><description>arXiv:2601.19255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for supply chain management to take proactive operations, but faces challenges: classical unsupervised anomaly detection based on exploiting data patterns often yields results misaligned with business requirements and domain knowledge, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of products in the supply chain. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19255v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] E-QRGMM: Efficient Generative Metamodeling for Covariate-Dependent Uncertainty Quantification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19256</link><description>arXiv:2601.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification in simulation-based inference is crucial for high-stakes decision-making but remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods such as conformal prediction and classical bootstrap, which struggle with covariate-specific conditioning. We propose Efficient Quantile-Regression-Based Generative Metamodeling (E-QRGMM), a novel framework that accelerates the quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) approach by integrating cubic Hermite interpolation with gradient estimation. Theoretically, we show that E-QRGMM preserves the convergence rate of the original QRGMM while reducing grid complexity from $O(n^{1/2})$ to $O(n^{1/5})$ for the majority of quantile levels, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency. Empirically, E-QRGMM achieves a superior trade-off between distributional accuracy and training speed compared to both QRGMM and other advanced deep generative models on synthetic and practical datasets. Moreover, by enabling bootstrap-based construction of confidence intervals for arbitrary estimands of interest, E-QRGMM provides a practical solution for covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19256v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GhostUI: Unveiling Hidden Interactions in Mobile UI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19258</link><description>arXiv:2601.19258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern mobile applications rely on hidden interactions--gestures without visual cues like long presses and swipes--to provide functionality without cluttering interfaces. While experienced users may discover these interactions through prior use or onboarding tutorials, their implicit nature makes them difficult for most users to uncover. Similarly, mobile agents--systems designed to automate tasks on mobile user interfaces, powered by vision language models (VLMs)--struggle to detect veiled interactions or determine actions for completing tasks. To address this challenge, we present GhostUI, a new dataset designed to enable the detection of hidden interactions in mobile applications. GhostUI provides before-and-after screenshots, simplified view hierarchies, gesture metadata, and task descriptions, allowing VLMs to better recognize concealed gestures and anticipate post-interaction states. Quantitative evaluations with VLMs show that models fine-tuned on GhostUI outperform baseline VLMs, particularly in predicting hidden interactions and inferring post-interaction screens, underscoring GhostUI's potential as a foundation for advancing mobile task automation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19258v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Collective Medication Effects via Multi-level Abstraction for Medication Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19259</link><description>arXiv:2601.19259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historical prescriptions and selected candidate drugs relevant to the current visit serve as important references for medication recommendation. However, in the absence of explicit intrinsic principles for semantic composition, existing methods treat synergistic drugs as independent entities and fail to capture their collective therapeutic effects, resulting in a mismatch between medication-level references and longitudinal patient representations. In this paper, we propose MSAM, a novel medication recommendation model that bridges the gap via multi-level medication abstraction. The model introduces a multi-head graph reasoning mechanism to organize flat daily medication sets into clinically meaningful semantic units, serving as intermediate abstraction results to propagate features from individual drugs to higher-level representations. Building on these units, MSAM performs two-stage abstraction over historical prescriptions and selected candidates via intra- and inter-level feature propagation across heterogeneous clinical structures, capturing collective therapeutic effects aligned with patient conditions. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets show that MSAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of structural medication abstraction for recommendation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19259v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "ENERGY STAR" LLM-Enabled Software Engineering Tools</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19260</link><description>arXiv:2601.19260v1 Announce Type: new

As AI becomes seamlessly available in these tools and, in many cases, is active by default, we are entering a new era with significant implications for energy consumption patterns throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). We focus on advanced Machine Learning (ML) capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our proposed approach combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Prompt Engineering Techniques (PETs) to enhance both the quality and energy efficiency of LLM-based code generation. We present a comprehensive framework that measures real-time energy consumption and inference time across diverse model architectures ranging from 125M to 7B parameters, including GPT-2, CodeLlama, Qwen 2.5, and DeepSeek Coder. These LLMs, chosen for practical reasons, are sufficient to validate the core ideas and provide a proof of concept for more in-depth future analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19260v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoupled Split Learning via Auxiliary Loss</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19261</link><description>arXiv:2601.19261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split learning is a distributed training paradigm where a neural network is partitioned between clients and a server, which allows data to remain at the client while only intermediate activations are shared. Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19261v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Handcrafted Feature Fusion for Reliable Detection of AI-Generated Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19262</link><description>arXiv:2601.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising concerns about authenticity and trust in digital media. Detecting such fake content reliably is an urgent challenge. While deep learning approaches dominate current literature, handcrafted features remain attractive for their interpretability, efficiency, and generalizability. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of handcrafted descriptors, including raw pixels, color histograms, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and wavelet features, on the CIFAKE dataset of real versus synthetic images. Using 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples, we benchmark seven classifiers ranging from Logistic Regression to advanced gradient-boosted ensembles (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost). Results demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms alternatives, achieving PR-AUC 0.9879, ROC-AUC 0.9878, F1 0.9447, and a Brier score of 0.0414 with mixed features, representing strong gains in calibration and discrimination over simpler descriptors. Across three configurations (baseline, advanced, mixed), performance improves monotonically, confirming that combining diverse handcrafted features yields substantial benefit. These findings highlight the continued relevance of carefully engineered features and ensemble learning for detecting synthetic images, particularly in contexts where interpretability and computational efficiency are critical.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19262v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Reconfigurable Framework for AI-FPGA Agent Integration and Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19263</link><description>arXiv:2601.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly deployed in real-time and energy-constrained environments, driving demand for hardware platforms that can deliver high performance and power efficiency. While central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) have traditionally served as the primary inference engines, their general-purpose nature often leads to inefficiencies under strict latency or power budgets. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer a promising alternative by enabling custom-tailored parallelism and hardware-level optimizations. However, mapping AI workloads to FPGAs remains challenging due to the complexity of hardware-software co-design and data orchestration. This paper presents AI FPGA Agent, an agent-driven framework that simplifies the integration and acceleration of deep neural network inference on FPGAs. The proposed system employs a runtime software agent that dynamically partitions AI models, schedules compute-intensive layers for hardware offload, and manages data transfers with minimal developer intervention. The hardware component includes a parameterizable accelerator core optimized for high-throughput inference using quantized arithmetic. Experimental results demonstrate that the AI FPGA Agent achieves over 10x latency reduction compared to CPU baselines and 2-3x higher energy efficiency than GPU implementations, all while preserving classification accuracy within 0.2% of full-precision references. These findings underscore the potential of AI-FPGA co-design for scalable, energy-efficient AI deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19263v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Whitespaces Don't Lie: Feature-Driven and Embedding-Based Approaches for Detecting Machine-Generated Code</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19264</link><description>arXiv:2601.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made it remarkably easy to synthesize plausible source code from natural language prompts. While this accelerates software development and supports learning, it also raises new risks for academic integrity, authorship attribution, and responsible AI use. This paper investigates the problem of distinguishing human-written from machine-generated code by comparing two complementary approaches: feature-based detectors built from lightweight, interpretable stylometric and structural properties of code, and embedding-based detectors leveraging pretrained code encoders. Using a recent large-scale benchmark dataset of 600k human-written and AI-generated code samples, we find that feature-based models achieve strong performance (ROC-AUC 0.995, PR-AUC 0.995, F1 0.971), while embedding-based models with CodeBERT embeddings are also very competitive (ROC-AUC 0.994, PR-AUC 0.994, F1 0.965). Analysis shows that features tied to indentation and whitespace provide particularly discriminative cues, whereas embeddings capture deeper semantic patterns and yield slightly higher precision. These findings underscore the trade-offs between interpretability and generalization, offering practical guidance for deploying robust code-origin detection in academic and industrial contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19264v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Multi-View Consistency Framework with Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19266</link><description>arXiv:2601.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) leverages knowledge from a fully labeled source domain to classify data in a partially labeled target domain. Due to the limited number of labeled samples in the target domain, there can be intrinsic similarity of classes in the feature space, which may result in biased predictions, even when the model is trained on a balanced dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-domain affinity learning aimed at aligning features of the same class across different domains, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing methods on two standard domain adaptation datasets, DomainNet and Office-Home. Combining unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning offers indispensable contributions to the industrial sector by enhancing model adaptability, reducing annotation costs, and improving performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiaDem: Advancing Dialogue Descriptions in Audiovisual Video Captioning for Multimodal Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19267</link><description>arXiv:2601.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate dialogue description in audiovisual video captioning is crucial for downstream understanding and generation tasks. However, existing models generally struggle to produce faithful dialogue descriptions within audiovisual captions. To mitigate this limitation, we propose DiaDem, a powerful audiovisual video captioning model capable of generating captions with more precise dialogue descriptions while maintaining strong overall performance. We first synthesize a high-quality dataset for SFT, then employ a difficulty-partitioned two-stage GRPO strategy to further enhance dialogue descriptions. To enable systematic evaluation of dialogue description capabilities, we introduce DiaDemBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate models across diverse dialogue scenarios, emphasizing both speaker attribution accuracy and utterance transcription fidelity in audiovisual captions. Extensive experiments on DiaDemBench reveal even commercial models still exhibit substantial room for improvement in dialogue-aware captioning. Notably, DiaDem not only outperforms the Gemini series in dialogue description accuracy but also achieves competitive performance on general audiovisual captioning benchmarks, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19267v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Riddle Quest : The Enigma of Words</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19273</link><description>arXiv:2601.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riddles are concise linguistic puzzles that describe an object or idea through indirect, figurative, or playful clues. They are a longstanding form of creative expression, requiring the solver to interpret hints, recognize patterns, and draw inferences to identify the answers. In this work, we introduce a simple pipeline for creating and evaluating analogy-based riddles. The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types. Our case study shows that while models often guess the main intended answer, they frequently miss other valid interpretations. This highlights the value of riddles as a lightweight tool for examining reasoning coverage and ambiguity handling in language models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19273v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tactile Memory with Soft Robot: Robust Object Insertion via Masked Encoding and Soft Wrist</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19275</link><description>arXiv:2601.19275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile memory, the ability to store and retrieve touch-based experience, is critical for contact-rich tasks such as key insertion under uncertainty. To replicate this capability, we introduce Tactile Memory with Soft Robot (TaMeSo-bot), a system that integrates a soft wrist with tactile retrieval-based control to enable safe and robust manipulation. The soft wrist allows safe contact exploration during data collection, while tactile memory reuses past demonstrations via retrieval for flexible adaptation to unseen scenarios. The core of this system is the Masked Tactile Trajectory Transformer (MAT$^\text{3}$), which jointly models spatiotemporal interactions between robot actions, distributed tactile feedback, force-torque measurements, and proprioceptive signals. Through masked-token prediction, MAT$^\text{3}$ learns rich spatiotemporal representations by inferring missing sensory information from context, autonomously extracting task-relevant features without explicit subtask segmentation. We validate our approach on peg-in-hole tasks with diverse pegs and conditions in real-robot experiments. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that MAT$^\text{3}$ achieves higher success rates than the baselines over all conditions and shows remarkable capability to adapt to unseen pegs and conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19275v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Talos: Optimizing Top-$K$ Accuracy in Recommender Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19276</link><description>arXiv:2601.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) aim to retrieve a small set of items that best match individual user preferences. Naturally, RS place primary emphasis on the quality of the Top-$K$ results rather than performance across the entire item set. However, estimating Top-$K$ accuracy (e.g., Precision@$K$, Recall@$K$) requires determining the ranking positions of items, which imposes substantial computational overhead and poses significant challenges for optimization. In addition, RS often suffer from distribution shifts due to evolving user preferences or data biases, further complicating the task.
  To address these issues, we propose Talos, a loss function that is specifically designed to optimize the Talos recommendation accuracy. Talos leverages a quantile technique that replaces the complex ranking-dependent operations into simpler comparisons between predicted scores and learned score thresholds. We further develop a sampling-based regression algorithm for efficient and accurate threshold estimation, and introduce a constraint term to maintain optimization stability by preventing score inflation. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored surrogate function to address discontinuity and enhance robustness against distribution shifts. Comprehensive theoretical analyzes and empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, convergence, and distributional robustness of Talos.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless approach for accelerating LLM inference. However, existing widely adopted model-based draft designs, such as EAGLE3, improve accuracy at the cost of multi-step autoregressive inference, resulting in high drafting latency and ultimately rendering the drafting stage itself a performance bottleneck. Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning is increasingly driven by the refinement of post-training loss functions and alignment strategies. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.
  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline. Qualitative analysis shows an emergent curriculum: the adversaries shift resources to the evolving reasoning frontier, enhancing the reasoning model's performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19280v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gazeify Then Voiceify: Physical Object Referencing Through Gaze and Voice Interaction with Displayless Smart Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19281</link><description>arXiv:2601.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart glasses enhance interactions with the environment by using head-mounted cameras to observe the user's viewpoint, but lack the visual feedback used for common interactions. We introduce Gazeify then Voiceify, a multimodal approach allowing object selection via gaze and voice using displayless smart glasses. Users can select a physical object with their gaze, and the system generates a digital mask and a voice description of the object's semantics. Users can further correct errors through free-form conversation. To demonstrate our approach, we develop an interactive system by integrating advanced object segmentation and detection with a vision-language model. User studies reveal that participants achieve correct gaze selection in 53% of the task trials and use voice disambiguation to correct 58% of the remaining errors. Participants also rated the system as likable, useful, and easy to use.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19281v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Output Feedback Stabilization of Linear Systems via Policy Gradient Methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19284</link><description>arXiv:2601.19284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizing a dynamical system is a fundamental problem that serves as a cornerstone for many complex tasks in the field of control systems. The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smoothing the Score Function for Generalization in Diffusion Models: An Optimization-based Explanation Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19285</link><description>arXiv:2601.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generation quality, yet face a fundamental challenge known as memorization, where generated samples can replicate training samples exactly. We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReToP: Learning to Rewrite Electronic Health Records for Clinical Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19286</link><description>arXiv:2601.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide crucial information for clinical decision-making. However, their high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity make clinical prediction challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) allowed progress towards addressing this challenge by leveraging parametric medical knowledge to enhance EHR data for clinical prediction tasks. Despite the significant achievements made so far, most of the existing approaches are fundamentally task-agnostic in the sense that they deploy LLMs as EHR encoders or EHR completion modules without fully integrating signals from the prediction tasks. This naturally hinders task performance accuracy. In this work, we propose Rewrite-To-Predict (ReToP), an LLM-based framework that addresses this limitation through an end-to-end training of an EHR rewriter and a clinical predictor. To cope with the lack of EHR rewrite training data, we generate synthetic pseudo-labels using clinical-driven feature selection strategies to create diverse patient rewrites for fine-tuning the EHR rewriter. ReToP aligns the rewriter with prediction objectives using a novel Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC) score that enables the EHR rewriter to generate clinically relevant rewrites that directly enhance prediction. Our ReToP framework surpasses strong baseline models across three clinical tasks on MIMIC-IV. Moreover, the analysis of ReToP shows its generalizability to unseen datasets and tasks with minimal fine-tuning while preserving faithful rewrites and emphasizing task-relevant predictive features.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19286v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Dominant Themes in Reviewing Agentic AI-authored Code</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19287</link><description>arXiv:2601.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While prior work has examined the generation capabilities of Agentic AI systems, little is known about how reviewers respond to AI-authored code in practice. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of code review dynamics in agent-generated PRs. Using a curated subset of the AIDev dataset, we analyze 19,450 inline review comments spanning 3,177 agent-authored PRs from real-world GitHub repositories. We first derive a taxonomy of 12 review comment themes using topic modeling combined with large language model (LLM)-assisted semantic clustering and consolidation. According to this taxonomy, we then investigate whether zero-shot prompts to LLM can reliably annotate review comments. Our evaluation against human annotations shows that open-source LLM achieves reasonably high exact match (78.63%), macro F1 score (0.78), and substantial agreement with human annotators at the review comment level. At the PR level, the LLM also correctly identifies the dominant review theme with 78% Top-1 accuracy and achieves an average Jaccard similarity of 0.76, indicating strong alignment with human judgments. Applying this annotation pipeline at scale, we find that apart from functional correctness and logical changes, reviews of agent-authored PRs predominantly focus on documentation gaps, refactoring needs, styling and formatting issues, with testing and security-related concerns. These findings suggest that while AI agents can accelerate code production, there remain gaps requiring targeted human review oversight.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19287v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MetaGen: Self-Evolving Roles and Topologies for Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19290</link><description>arXiv:2601.19290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed as multi-agent systems, where specialized roles communicate and collaborate through structured interactions to solve complex tasks that often exceed the capacity of a single agent. However, most existing systems still rely on a fixed role library and an execution-frozen interaction topology, a rigid design choice that frequently leads to task mismatch, prevents timely adaptation when new evidence emerges during reasoning, and further inflates inference cost. We introduce MetaGen, a training-free framework that adapts both the role space and the collaboration topology at inference time, without updating base model weights. MetaGen generates and rewrites query-conditioned role specifications to maintain a controllable dynamic role pool, then instantiates a constrained execution graph around a minimal backbone. During execution, it iteratively updates role prompts and adjusts structural decisions using lightweight feedback signals. Experiments on code generation and multi-step reasoning benchmarks show that MetaGen improves the accuracy and cost tradeoff over strong multi-agent baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19290v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Words have Weight: Comparing the use of pressure and weight as a metaphor in a User Interface in Virtual Reality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19294</link><description>arXiv:2601.19294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates how weight and pressure can function as haptic metaphors to support user interface notifications in Virtual Reality (VR). While prior research has explored ungrounded weight simulation and pneumatic feedback, their combined role in conveying information through UI elements remains underexplored. We developed a wearable haptic device that transfers liquid and air into flexible containers mounted on the back of the user's hand, allowing us to independently manipulate weight and pressure. Through an initial evaluation using three conditions-no feedback, weight only, and weight combined with pressure-we examined how these signals affect perceived heaviness, coherence with visual cues, and the perceived urgency of notifications. Our results validate that pressure amplifies the perception of weight, but this increased heaviness does not translate into higher perceived urgency. These findings suggest that while pressure___enhanced weight can enrich haptic rendering of UI elements in VR, its contribution to communicating urgency may require further investigation, alternative pressure profiles, or different types of notifications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19294v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProMist-5K: A Comprehensive Dataset for Digital Emulation of Cinematic Pro-Mist Filter Effects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19295</link><description>arXiv:2601.19295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pro-Mist filters are widely used in cinematography for their ability to create soft halation, lower contrast, and produce a distinctive, atmospheric style. These effects are difficult to reproduce digitally due to the complex behavior of light diffusion. We present ProMist-5K, a dataset designed to support cinematic style emulation. It is built using a physically inspired pipeline in a scene-referred linear space and includes 20,000 high-resolution image pairs across four configurations, covering two filter densities (1/2 and 1/8) and two focal lengths (20mm and 50mm). Unlike general style datasets, ProMist-5K focuses on realistic glow and highlight diffusion effects. Multiple blur layers and carefully tuned weighting are used to model the varying intensity and spread of optical diffusion. The dataset provides a consistent and controllable target domain that supports various image translation models and learning paradigms.

Abstract: Accurately predicting procurement lead time (PLT) remains a challenge in engineered-to-order industries such as shipbuilding and plant construction, where delays in a single key component can disrupt project timelines. In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement. Comparative experiments are conducted using real-world pipe spool procurement data from a globally renowned South Korean shipbuilding corporation. Three tasks are evaluated, which are production, post-processing, and procurement lead time prediction. The results show a 22.6% to 50.4% improvement in prediction performance in terms of mean absolute error over the best-performing existing approaches across the three tasks. These findings indicate the value of considering procurement process information for more accurate PLT prediction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19296v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Phase-Retrieval-Based Physics-Informed Neural Networks For Acoustic Magnitude Field Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19297</link><description>arXiv:2601.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for estimating the magnitude distribution of an acoustic field from spatially sparse magnitude measurements. Such a method is useful when phase measurements are unreliable or inaccessible. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise for sound field estimation by incorporating constraints derived from governing partial differential equations (PDEs) into neural networks. However, they do not extend to settings where phase measurements are unavailable, as the loss function based on the governing PDE relies on phase information. To remedy this, we propose a phase-retrieval-based PINN for magnitude field estimation. By representing the magnitude and phase distributions with separate networks, the PDE loss can be computed based on the reconstructed complex amplitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our phase-retrieval-based PINN through experimental evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19297v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Formula-One Prompting: Adaptive Reasoning Through Equations For Applied Mathematics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19302</link><description>arXiv:2601.19302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-of-Thought (PoT) improve LLM mathematical reasoning by structuring intermediate steps in natural language or code. However, applied mathematics problems in domains like finance, physics, and cryptography often require recalling or deriving governing equations, a step that current approaches do not explicitly leverage. We propose Formula-One Prompting (F-1), a two-phase approach that uses mathematical equations as an intermediate representation before adaptive solving. F-1 first formulates governing equations from problem descriptions, then selects a solving strategy among CoT, PoT, or direct computation based on the generated equations, all within a single LLM call. Results across five models and four benchmarks show F-1 outperforms CoT by +5.76% and PoT by +8.42% on average. Crucially, gains are largest in applied domains: +13.30% on FinanceMath over CoT, and within OlympiadBench, larger gains on physics (+2.55%) than pure math (+0.44%). This demonstrates that F-1 is more effective than CoT in applied mathematics problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19302v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Collaborative Extended Reality Prototype for 3D Surgical Planning and Visualization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19303</link><description>arXiv:2601.19303v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Spoken English proficiency is a powerful driver of economic mobility for low-income Indian youth, yet opportunities for spoken practice remain scarce in schools. We investigate the deployment of a voice-based chatbot for English conversation practice across four low-resource schools in Delhi. Through a six-day field study combining observations and interviews, we captured the perspectives of students, teachers, and principals. Findings confirm high demand across all groups, with notable gains in student speaking confidence. Our multi-stakeholder analysis surfaced a tension in long-term adoption vision: students favored open-ended conversational practice, while administrators emphasized curriculum-aligned assessment. We offer design recommendations for voice-enabled chatbots in low-resource multilingual contexts, highlighting the need for more intelligible speech output for non-native learners, one-tap interactions with simplified interfaces, and actionable analytics for educators. Beyond language learning, our findings inform the co-design of future AI-based educational technologies that are socially sustainable within the complex ecosystem of low-resource schools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19304v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Curiosity Driven Knowledge Retrieval for Mobile Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19306</link><description>arXiv:2601.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile agents have made progress toward reliable smartphone automation, yet performance in complex applications remains limited by incomplete knowledge and weak generalization to unseen environments. We introduce a curiosity driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes uncertainty during execution as a curiosity score. When this score exceeds a threshold, the system retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories. Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model. Case studies further confirm that AppCards reduce ambiguity, shorten exploration, and support stable execution trajectories. Task trajectories are publicly available at https://lisalsj.github.io/Droidrun-appcard/.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19306v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ClipGS-VR: Immersive and Interactive Cinematic Visualization of Volumetric Medical Data in Mobile Virtual Reality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19310</link><description>arXiv:2601.19310v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: As large language models become integral to agentic artificial intelligence systems, their energy demands during inference may pose significant sustainability challenges. This study investigates whether deploying smaller-scale language models can reduce energy consumption without compromising responsiveness and output quality in a multi-agent, real-world environments. We conduct a comparative analysis across language models of varying scales to quantify trade-offs between efficiency and performance.

Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks.

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19314v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalizable IoT Traffic Representations for Cross-Network Device Identification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19315</link><description>arXiv:2601.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying network traffic and identifying Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, enabling operators to discover and manage IoT assets at scale. However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19315v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Modeling Sampling Workflows for Code Repositories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19316</link><description>arXiv:2601.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical software engineering research often depends on datasets of code repository artifacts, where sampling strategies are employed to enable large-scale analyses. The design and evaluation of these strategies are critical, as they directly influence the generalizability of research findings. However, sampling remains an underestimated aspect in software engineering research: we identify two main challenges related to (1) the design and representativeness of sampling approaches, and (2) the ability to reason about the implications of sampling decisions on generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to explicitly describe complex sampling strategies through composable sampling operators. This formalism supports both the specification and the reasoning about the generalizability of results based on the applied sampling strategies. We implement the DSL as a Python-based fluent API, and demonstrate how it facilitates representativeness reasoning using statistical indicators extracted from sampling workflows. We validate our approach through a case study of MSR papers involving code repository sampling. Our results show that the DSL can model the sampling strategies reported in recent literature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19316v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Perception-to-Pursuit: Track-Centric Temporal Reasoning for Open-World Drone Detection and Autonomous Chasing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19318</link><description>arXiv:2601.19318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous drone pursuit requires not only detecting drones but also predicting their trajectories in a manner that enables kinematically feasible interception. Existing tracking methods optimize for prediction accuracy but ignore pursuit feasibility, resulting in trajectories that are physically impossible to intercept 99.9% of the time. We propose Perception-to-Pursuit (P2P), a track-centric temporal reasoning framework that bridges detection and actionable pursuit planning. Our method represents drone motion as compact 8-dimensional tokens capturing velocity, acceleration, scale, and smoothness, enabling a 12-frame causal transformer to reason about future behavior. We introduce the Intercept Success Rate (ISR) metric to measure pursuit feasibility under realistic interceptor constraints. Evaluated on the Anti-UAV-RGBT dataset with 226 real drone sequences, P2P achieves 28.12 pixel average displacement error and 0.597 ISR, representing a 77% improvement in trajectory prediction and 597x improvement in pursuit feasibility over tracking-only baselines, while maintaining perfect drone classification accuracy (100%). Our work demonstrates that temporal reasoning over motion patterns enables both accurate prediction and actionable pursuit planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19318v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StableQAT: Stable Quantization-Aware Training at Ultra-Low Bitwidths</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19320</link><description>arXiv:2601.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential for deploying large models under strict memory and latency constraints, yet achieving stable and robust optimization at ultra-low bitwidths remains challenging. Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

Abstract: We present Innovator-VL, a scientific multimodal large language model designed to advance understanding and reasoning across diverse scientific domains while maintaining excellent performance on general vision tasks. Contrary to the trend of relying on massive domain-specific pretraining and opaque pipelines, our work demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can yield strong scientific intelligence with substantially reduced data requirements. (i) First, we provide a fully transparent, end-to-end reproducible training pipeline, covering data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation, along with detailed optimization recipes. This facilitates systematic extension by the community. (ii) Second, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance on various scientific tasks using fewer than five million curated samples without large-scale pretraining. These results highlight that effective reasoning can be achieved through principled data selection rather than indiscriminate scaling. (iii) Third, Innovator-VL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving competitive performance on general vision, multimodal reasoning, and scientific benchmarks. This indicates that scientific alignment can be integrated into a unified model without compromising general-purpose capabilities. Our practices suggest that efficient, reproducible, and high-performing scientific multimodal models can be built even without large-scale data, providing a practical foundation for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19325v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CaseMaster: Designing and Evaluating a Probe for Oral Case Presentation Training with LLM Assistance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19332</link><description>arXiv:2601.19332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing an oral case presentation (OCP) is a crucial skill for medical students, requiring clear communication of patient information, clinical findings, and treatment plans. However, inconsistent student participation and limited guidance can make this task challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide structured content to streamline the process, their role in facilitating skill development and supporting medical education integration remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted a formative study with six medical educators and developed CaseMaster, an interactive probe that leverages LLM-generated content tailored to medical education to help users enhance their OCP skills. The controlled study suggests CaseMaster has the potential to both improve presentation quality and reduce workload compared to traditional methods, an implication reinforced by expert feedback. We propose guidelines for educators to develop adaptive, user-centered training methods using LLMs, while considering the implications of integrating advanced technologies into medical education.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19332v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Metric $k$-clustering using only Weak Comparison Oracles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19333</link><description>arXiv:2601.19333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning. However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.
  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\cdot k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19333v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Benchmarks Leak: Inference-Time Decontamination for LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19334</link><description>arXiv:2601.19334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmark-based evaluation is the de facto standard for comparing large language models (LLMs). However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Observations to Events: Event-Aware World Model for Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19336</link><description>arXiv:2601.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

Abstract: Modern AI systems increasingly comprise multiple interconnected neural networks to tackle complex inference tasks. Testing such systems for robustness and safety entails significant challenges. Current state-of-the-art robustness testing techniques, whether black-box or white-box, have been proposed and implemented for single-network models and do not scale well to multi-network pipelines. We propose a modular robustness testing framework that applies a given set of perturbations to test data. Our testing framework supports (1) a component-wise system analysis to isolate errors and (2) reasoning about error propagation across the neural network modules. The testing framework is architecture and modality agnostic and can be applied across domains. We apply the framework to a real-world autonomous rail inspection system composed of multiple deep networks and successfully demonstrate how our approach enables fine-grained robustness analysis beyond conventional end-to-end metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19337v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Psychological Science of Artificial Intelligence: A Rapidly Emerging Field of Psychology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19338</link><description>arXiv:2601.19338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The psychological science of artificial intelligence (AI) can be broadly defined as an emerging field of psychology that examines all AI-related mental and behavioral processes from the perspective of psychology. This field has been growing exponentially in the recent decade. This review synthesizes the existing literature on the psychological science of AI with a goal to provide a comprehensive conceptual framework for planning, conducting, and assessing scientific research in the field.

Abstract: This article presents an eco-driving algorithm for electric vehicles featuring multi-speed transmissions. The proposed controller is formulated as a co-optimization problem, simultaneously optimizing both vehicle longitudinal speed and powertrain operation to maximize energy efficiency. Constraints derived from a connected vehicle based traffic prediction algorithm are used to ensure traffic safety and smooth traffic flow in dynamic environments with multiple signalized intersections and mixed traffic. By simplifying the complex, nonlinear mixed integer problem, the proposed controller achieves computational efficiency, enabling real-time implementation. To evaluate its performance, traffic scenarios from both Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) and real-world road tests are employed. The results demonstrate a notable reduction in energy consumption by up to 11.36\% over an \SI{18}{\km} drive.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19340v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Uncertainty Estimation under Distribution Shift via Difference Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19341</link><description>arXiv:2601.19341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19341v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Modeling Behavioral Signals in Job Scams: A Human-Centered Security Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19342</link><description>arXiv:2601.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Job scams have emerged as a rapidly growing form of cybercrime that manipulates human decision-making processes. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on scam typologies or post-loss indicators, offering limited support for early-stage intervention. In this study, we examine how behavioral decision signals can be operationalized as computational features for identifying vulnerability-associated signals in job fraud. Using anonymous survey data collected from a university population, we analyze two dominant job scam pathways: payment-based scams that require upfront fees and task-based scams that begin with small rewards before escalating to financial demands. Drawing on behavioral economics, we operationalize sunk cost influence, urgency/time-pressure cues, and social proof as measurable behavioral signals, and analyze their association with payment behavior using exact inference under sparsity and uncertainty-aware estimation, with social proof treated as a context-dependent legitimacy cue rather than a standalone predictor. Our results show that urgency/time-pressure cues are significantly associated with payment behavior, consistent with their role as proximal compliance triggers during escalation. In contrast, opportunity-loss/FOMO cues were not reliably identifiable under the current operationalization in our encounter subset, highlighting the importance of measurement fidelity and cue-definition consistency. We further observe that emotional tone in victim narratives and selective non-response to sensitive questions vary systematically with financial loss and reporting behavior, suggesting that missingness may reflect a combination of survey fatigue and selective non-disclosure for sensitive items rather than purely random noise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19342v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-driven Intrusion Detection for UAV in Smart Urban Ecosystems: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19345</link><description>arXiv:2601.19345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UAVs have the potential to revolutionize urban management and provide valuable services to citizens. They can be deployed across diverse applications, including traffic monitoring, disaster response, environmental monitoring, and numerous other domains. However, this integration introduces novel security challenges that must be addressed to ensure safe and trustworthy urban operations. This paper provides a structured, evidence-based synthesis of UAV applications in smart cities and their associated security challenges as reported in the literature over the last decade, with particular emphasis on developments from 2019 to 2025. We categorize these challenges into two primary classes: 1) cyber-attacks targeting the communication infrastructure of UAVs and 2) unwanted or unauthorized physical intrusions by UAVs themselves. We examine the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in developing intrusion detection mechanisms to mitigate these security threats. We analyze how AI-based methods, such as machine/deep learning for anomaly detection and computer vision for object recognition, can play a pivotal role in enhancing UAV security through unified detection systems that address both cyber and physical threats. Furthermore, we consolidate publicly available UAV datasets across network traffic and vision modalities suitable for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) development and evaluation. The paper concludes by identifying ten key research directions, including scalability, robustness, explainability, data scarcity, automation, hybrid detection, large language models, multimodal approaches, federated learning, and privacy preservation. Finally, we discuss the practical challenges of implementing UAV IDS solutions in real-world smart city environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19345v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GeoSSA: Geometric Sparrow Search Algorithm for UAV Path Planning and Engineering Design Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19346</link><description>arXiv:2601.19346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), characterized by its simple structure and ease of implementation, nevertheless suffers from an insufficient balance between exploration and exploitation, making it prone to premature convergence and slow optimization progress. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a Geometric Sparrow Search Algorithm (GeoSSA). By integrating Good Nodes Set initialization, a Sine-Cosine Enhanced Producer position update strategy, and a Triangular-Walk Enhanced Edge Sparrow update strategy, GeoSSA significantly improves the global exploration ability, local exploitation efficiency, and convergence stability of the original SSA. To thoroughly validate the effectiveness of GeoSSA, we conducted ablation studies, qualitative analysis, and comparative experiments on 23 benchmark functions against state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that GeoSSA achieves the best or near-best performance in terms of average fitness, standard deviation, Wilcoxon tests, and Friedman rankings, with an Overall Effectiveness ($OE$) of 95.65\%. Its overall performance is significantly superior to all compared algorithms. In three-dimensional UAV path planning tasks, GeoSSA demonstrates excellent stability and superior path quality. In four categories of engineering design optimization problems, GeoSSA consistently attains the highest solution accuracy and strongest stability. GeoSSA not only exhibits outstanding global optimization performance on standard benchmark functions but also shows strong robustness and generalization ability in practical applications such as UAV path planning and engineering design. Therefore, GeoSSA provides an efficient and reliable solution framework for complex optimization problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CommSense: Facilitating Bias-Aware and Reflective Navigation of Online Comments for Rational Judgment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19347</link><description>arXiv:2601.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online comments significantly influence users' judgments, yet their presentation, often determined by platform algorithms, can introduce biases, such as anchoring effects, which distort reasoning. While existing research emphasizes mitigating individual cognitive biases, the evolution of user judgments during comment engagement remains overlooked. This study investigates how presentation cues impact reasoning and explores interface design strategies to mitigate bias. Through a preliminary experiment (N=18) and a co-design workshop, we identified key challenges users face across a four-stage process and distilled four design requirements: pre-engagement framing, interactive organization, reflective prompts, and synthesis support. Based on these insights, we developed CommSense, an on-the-fly plugin that enhances user engagement with online comments by providing visual overviews and lightweight prompts to guide reasoning. A between-subject evaluation (N=24) demonstrates that CommSense improves bias awareness and reflective thinking, helping users produce more comprehensive, evidence-based rationales while maintaining high usability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19347v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Examination Framework: A Task-Agnostic Diagnostic for Information Fidelity in Text-to-Text Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19350</link><description>arXiv:2601.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional metrics like BLEU and BERTScore fail to capture semantic fidelity in generative text-to-text tasks. We adapt the Cross-Examination Framework (CEF) for a reference-free, multi-dimensional evaluation by treating the source and candidate as independent knowledge bases. CEF generates verifiable questions from each text and performs a cross-examination to derive three interpretable scores: Coverage, Conformity, and Consistency. Validated across translation, summarization and clinical note-generation, our framework identifies critical errors, such as content omissions and factual contradictions, missed by standard metrics. A key contribution is a systematic robustness analysis to select a stable judge model. Crucially, the strong correlation between our reference-free and with-reference modes validates CEF's reliability without gold references. Furthermore, human expert validation demonstrates that CEF mismatching questions align with meaning-altering semantic errors higher than with non-semantic errors, particularly excelling at identifying entity-based and relational distortions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19350v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GraphSB: Boosting Imbalanced Node Classification on Graphs through Structural Balance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19352</link><description>arXiv:2601.19352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Supervised Path Planning in Unstructured Environments via Global-Guided Differentiable Hard Constraint Projection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19354</link><description>arXiv:2601.19354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying deep learning agents for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments faces critical challenges regarding safety, data scarcity, and limited computational resources. Traditional solvers often suffer from high latency, while emerging learning-based approaches struggle to ensure deterministic feasibility. To bridge the gap from embodied to embedded intelligence, we propose a self-supervised framework incorporating a differentiable hard constraint projection layer for runtime assurance. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold. Extensive benchmarks on a test set of 20,000 scenarios demonstrate an 88.75\% success rate, substantiating the enhanced operational safety. Closed-loop experiments in CARLA further validate the physical realizability of the planned paths under dynamic constraints. Furthermore, deployment verification on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX confirms an inference latency of 94 ms, showing real-time feasibility on resource-constrained embedded hardware. This framework offers a generalized paradigm for embedding physical laws into neural architectures, providing a viable direction for solving constrained optimization in mechatronics.

Abstract: This work develops a polygonal cell-based smoothed finite element method for steady-state, transient, and free-surface seepage in saturated porous media. Wachspress interpolation on convex polygonal elements is combined with cell-based gradient smoothing, so that element matrices are assembled using boundary integrals without in-element derivatives. Polygonal, quadtree, and hybrid quadtree--polygonal meshes are employed to accommodate local refinement and hanging nodes, and a solution-driven adaptive strategy further concentrates resolution near steep gradients and wet--dry transitions. Free-surface seepage is solved using a fixed-mesh iterative scheme that updates the wetted region, permeability field, and boundary conditions. Benchmark tests demonstrate accurate hydraulic-head and free-surface predictions, and show that adaptivity attains similar accuracy with substantially fewer degrees of freedom and CPU time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19357v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Binary Token-Level Classification with DeBERTa for All-Type MWE Identification: A Lightweight Approach with Linguistic Enhancement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19360</link><description>arXiv:2601.19360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive approach for multiword expression (MWE) identification that combines binary token-level classification, linguistic feature integration, and data augmentation. Our DeBERTa-v3-large model achieves 69.8% F1 on the CoAM dataset, surpassing the best results (Qwen-72B, 57.8% F1) on this dataset by 12 points while using 165x fewer parameters. We achieve this performance by (1) reformulating detection as binary token-level START/END/INSIDE classification rather than span-based prediction, (2) incorporating NP chunking and dependency features that help discontinuous and NOUN-type MWEs identification, and (3) applying oversampling that addresses severe class imbalance in the training data. We confirm the generalization of our method on the STREUSLE dataset, achieving 78.9% F1. These results demonstrate that carefully designed smaller models can substantially outperform LLMs on structured NLP tasks, with important implications for resource-constrained deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19360v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Parameter Server in LLM Post-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19362</link><description>arXiv:2601.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern data parallel (DP) training favors collective communication over parameter servers (PS) for its simplicity and efficiency under balanced workloads. However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose \textbf{On-Demand Communication (ODC)}, which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training. Our implementation of ODC and integration with FSDP is open-sourced at https://github.com/sail-sg/odc.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19362v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CHEHAB RL: Learning to Optimize Fully Homomorphic Encryption Computations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19367</link><description>arXiv:2601.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computations directly on encrypted data, but its high computational cost remains a significant barrier. Writing efficient FHE code is a complex task requiring cryptographic expertise, and finding the optimal sequence of program transformations is often intractable. In this paper, we propose CHEHAB RL, a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) to automate FHE code optimization. Instead of relying on predefined heuristics or combinatorial search, our method trains an RL agent to learn an effective policy for applying a sequence of rewriting rules to automatically vectorize scalar FHE code while reducing instruction latency and noise growth. The proposed approach supports the optimization of both structured and unstructured code. To train the agent, we synthesize a diverse dataset of computations using a large language model (LLM). We integrate our proposed approach into the CHEHAB FHE compiler and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, comparing its performance against Coyote, a state-of-the-art vectorizing FHE compiler. The results show that our approach generates code that is $5.3\times$ faster in execution, accumulates $2.54\times$ less noise, while the compilation process itself is $27.9\times$ faster than Coyote (geometric means).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19367v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Analysis of Platooned Vehicular Networks on Highways</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19370</link><description>arXiv:2601.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular platooning refers to coordinated and close movement of vehicular users (VUs) traveling together along a common route segment, offering strategic benefits such as reduced fuel costs, lower emissions, and improved traffic flow. {Highways offer a natural setting for platooning due to extended travel distances, yet their potential remains underexplored, particularly in terms of communication and connectivity. Given that effective platooning relies on robust vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, understanding connectivity dynamics on highways is essential.} In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of vehicular platooning on a highway and its impact on the performance of two forms of vehicular communications -- namely V2V and V2I communication -- compared to independent vehicle movement on a highway. The vehicular networks consists of road-side units (RSUs), modeled as a 1D Poisson point process (PPP), to provide the vehicular connectivity to the VUs. VUs are modeled as 1D PPP under the non-platooned traffic scenario (N-PTS) and as a 1D Matern cluster process (MCP) under the platooned traffic scenario (PTS). We evaluate the distribution on the per-RSU load, representing the number of VUs served, for the typical and tagged RSU. Additionally, we derive coverage probability (CP) and rate coverage (RC), which measures the probability of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable rate above a specified threshold at the typical VU along with their meta distribution (MD), providing a deeper understanding of the reliability and variability of these metrics across different spatial distributions of VUs and RSUs. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations and provide numerical insights into the impact of different traffic patterns on RSU load distribution, CP, and RC performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19370v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Selective Steering: Norm-Preserving Control Through Discriminative Layer Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19375</link><description>arXiv:2601.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification.

Abstract: Accessing high-quality, open-access dermatopathology image datasets for learning and cross-referencing is a common challenge for clinicians and dermatopathology trainees. To establish a comprehensive open-access dermatopathology dataset for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes, we employed a hybrid workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) repository. We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6\% for the deep learning approach, 61.0\% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4\% for the hybrid approach. We retrieved over 7,772 images across 166 diagnoses and released this fully annotated dataset, reviewed by board-certified dermatopathologists. Using our dataset as a challenging task, we found the current image analysis algorithm from OpenAI inadequate for analyzing dermatopathology images. In conclusion, we have developed a large, peer-reviewed, open-access dermatopathology image dataset, DermpathNet, which features a semi-automated curation workflow.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19378v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tri-Reader: An Open-Access, Multi-Stage AI Pipeline for First-Pass Lung Nodule Annotation in Screening CT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19380</link><description>arXiv:2601.19380v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Code comments serve a crucial role in software development for documenting functionality, clarifying design choices, and assisting with issue tracking. They capture developers' insights about the surrounding source code, serving as an essential resource for both human comprehension and automated analysis. Nevertheless, since comments are in natural language, they present challenges for machine-based code understanding. To address this, recent studies have applied natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to classify comments according to developers' intentions. However, existing datasets for this task suffer from size limitations and class imbalance, as they rely on manual annotations and may not accurately represent the distribution of comments in real-world codebases. To overcome this issue, we introduce new synthetic oversampling and augmentation techniques based on high-quality data generation to enhance the NLBSE'26 challenge datasets. Our Synthetic Quality Oversampling Technique and Augmentation Technique (Q-SYNTH) yield promising results, improving the base classifier by $2.56\%$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19383v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GenPairX: A Hardware-Algorithm Co-Designed Accelerator for Paired-End Read Mapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19384</link><description>arXiv:2601.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genome sequencing has become a central focus in computational biology. A genome study typically begins with sequencing, which produces millions to billions of short DNA fragments known as reads. Read mapping aligns these reads to a reference genome. Read mapping for short reads comes in two forms: single-end and paired-end, with the latter being more prevalent due to its higher accuracy and support for advanced analysis. Read mapping remains a major performance bottleneck in genome analysis due to expensive dynamic programming. Prior efforts have attempted to mitigate this cost by employing filters to identify and potentially discard computationally expensive matches and leveraging hardware accelerators to speed up the computations. While partially effective, these approaches have limitations. In particular, existing filters are often ineffective for paired-end reads, as they evaluate each read independently and exhibit relatively low filtering ratios. In this work, we propose GenPairX, a hardware-algorithm co-designed accelerator that efficiently minimizes the computational load of paired-end read mapping while enhancing the throughput of memory-intensive operations. GenPairX introduces: (1) a novel filtering algorithm that jointly considers both reads in a pair to improve filtering effectiveness, and a lightweight alignment algorithm to replace most of the computationally expensive dynamic programming operations, and (2) two specialized hardware mechanisms to support the proposed algorithms. Our evaluations show that GenPairX delivers substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art solutions, achieving 1575x and 1.43x higher throughput per watt compared to leading CPU-based and accelerator-based read mappers, respectively, all without compromising accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19384v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MIRAGE: Enabling Real-Time Automotive Mediated Reality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19385</link><description>arXiv:2601.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic is inherently dangerous, with around 1.19 million fatalities annually. Automotive Mediated Reality (AMR) can enhance driving safety by overlaying critical information (e.g., outlines, icons, text) on key objects to improve awareness, altering objects' appearance to simplify traffic situations, and diminishing their appearance to minimize distractions. However, real-world AMR evaluation remains limited due to technical challenges. To fill this sim-to-real gap, we present MIRAGE, an open-source tool that enables real-time AMR in real vehicles. MIRAGE implements 15 effects across the AMR spectrum of augmented, diminished, and modified reality using state-of-the-art computational models for object detection and segmentation, depth estimation, and inpainting. In an on-road expert user study (N=9) of MIRAGE, participants enjoyed the AMR experience while pointing out technical limitations and identifying use cases for AMR. We discuss these results in relation to prior work and outline implications for AMR ethics and interaction design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19385v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging the Socio-Emotional Gap: The Functional Dimension of Human-AI Collaboration for Software Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19387</link><description>arXiv:2601.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As GenAI models are adopted to support software engineers and their development teams, understanding effective human-AI collaboration (HAIC) is increasingly important. Socio-emotional intelligence (SEI) enhances collaboration among human teammates, but its role in HAIC remains unclear. Current AI systems lack SEI capabilities that humans bring to teamwork, creating a potential gap in collaborative dynamics. In this study, we investigate how software practitioners perceive the socio-emotional gap in HAIC and what capabilities AI systems require for effective collaboration. Through semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners, we examine how they think about collaborating with human versus AI teammates, focusing on their SEI expectations and the AI capabilities they envision. Results indicate that practitioners currently view AI models as intellectual teammates rather than social partners and expect fewer SEI attributes from them than from human teammates. However, they see the socio-emotional gap not as AIs failure to exhibit SEI traits, but as a functional gap in collaborative capabilities (AIs inability to negotiate responsibilities, adapt contextually, or maintain sustained partnerships). We introduce the concept of functional equivalents: technical capabilities (internal cognition, contextual intelligence, adaptive learning, and collaborative intelligence) that achieve collaborative outcomes comparable to human SEI attributes. Our findings suggest that effective collaboration with AI for SE tasks may benefit from functional design rather than replicating human SEI traits for SE tasks, thereby redefining collaboration as functional alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19387v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Judgelight: Trajectory-Level Post-Optimization for Multi-Agent Path Finding via Closed-Subwalk Collapsing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19388</link><description>arXiv:2601.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is an NP-hard problem with applications in warehouse automation and multi-robot coordination. Learning-based MAPF solvers offer fast and scalable planning but often produce feasible trajectories that contain unnecessary or oscillatory movements. We propose Judgelight, a post-optimization method that improves trajectory quality after a MAPF solver generates a feasible schedule. Judgelight collapses closed subwalks in agents' trajectories to remove redundant movements while preserving all feasibility constraints. We formalize this process as MAPF-Collapse, prove that it is NP-hard, and present an exact optimization approach by formulating it as integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Experimental results show Judgelight consistently reduces solution cost by around 20%, particularly for learning-based solvers, producing trajectories that are better suited for real-world deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19388v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constructing self-referential instances for the clique problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19393</link><description>arXiv:2601.19393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose constructing self-referential instances to reveal the inherent algorithmic hardness of the clique problem. First, we prove the existence of a phase transition phenomenon for the clique problem in the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph model and derive an exact location for the transition point. Subsequently, at the transition point, we construct a family of graphs. In this family, each graph shares the same number of vertices, number of edges, and degree sequence, yet both instances containing a $k$-clique and instances without any $k$-clique are included. These two states can be transformed into each other through a symmetric transformation that preserves the degree of every vertex. This property explains why exhaustive search is required in the critical region: an algorithm must search nearly the entire solution space to determine the existence of a solution; otherwise, a counterinstance can be constructed from the original instance using the symmetric transformation. Finally, this paper elaborates on the intrinsic reason for this phenomenon from the independence of the solution space.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19393v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DSP-Reg: Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization for Robust Domain Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19394</link><description>arXiv:2601.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\% and surpassing all baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19394v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SEAFormer: A Spatial Proximity and Edge-Aware Transformer for Real-World Vehicle Routing Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19395</link><description>arXiv:2601.19395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (RWVRPs) require solving complex, sequence-dependent challenges at scale with constraints such as delivery time window, replenishment or recharging stops, asymmetric travel cost, etc. While recent neural methods achieve strong results on large-scale classical VRP benchmarks, they struggle to address RWVRPs because their strategies overlook sequence dependencies and underutilize edge-level information, which are precisely the characteristics that define the complexity of RWVRPs. We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SEAFormer is the first neural method to solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs effectively, while also achieving superior performance on classic VRPs, making it a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19395v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Residual Tokens Enhance Masked Autoencoders for Speech Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19399</link><description>arXiv:2601.19399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent speech modeling relies on explicit attributes such as pitch, content, and speaker identity, but these alone cannot capture the full richness of natural speech. We introduce RT-MAE, a novel masked autoencoder framework that augments the supervised attributes-based modeling with unsupervised residual trainable tokens, designed to encode the information not explained by explicit labeled factors (e.g., timbre variations, noise, emotion etc). Experiments show that RT-MAE improves reconstruction quality, preserving content and speaker similarity while enhancing expressivity. We further demonstrate its applicability to speech enhancement, removing noise at inference while maintaining controllability and naturalness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19399v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PROTEUS: SLA-Aware Routing via Lagrangian RL for Multi-LLM Serving Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19402</link><description>arXiv:2601.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production LLM deployments serve diverse workloads where cost and quality requirements vary by customer tier, time of day, and query criticality. Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle. Cost savings reach 89.8% versus the best fixed model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19402v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RPO:Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19404</link><description>arXiv:2601.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

Abstract: Synthetic simulation data and real-world human data provide scalable alternatives to circumvent the prohibitive costs of robot data collection. However, these sources suffer from the sim-to-real visual gap and the human-to-robot embodiment gap, respectively, which limits the policy's generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we identify a natural yet underexplored complementarity between these sources: simulation offers the robot action that human data lacks, while human data provides the real-world observation that simulation struggles to render. Motivated by this insight, we present SimHum, a co-training framework to simultaneously extract kinematic prior from simulated robot actions and visual prior from real-world human observations. Based on the two complementary priors, we achieve data-efficient and generalizable robotic manipulation in real-world tasks. Empirically, SimHum outperforms the baseline by up to $\mathbf{40\%}$ under the same data collection budget, and achieves a $\mathbf{62.5\%}$ OOD success with only 80 real data, outperforming the real only baseline by $7.1\times$.

Abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to refine machine translations by correcting residual errors. Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency.
  Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19410v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Task-Centric Policy Optimization from Misaligned Motion Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19411</link><description>arXiv:2601.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid control often leverages motion priors from human demonstrations to encourage natural behaviors. However, such demonstrations are frequently suboptimal or misaligned with robotic tasks due to embodiment differences, retargeting errors, and task-irrelevant variations, causing na\"ive imitation to degrade task performance. Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions. This exposes a fundamental limitation of linear reward mixing in adversarial imitation learning. We propose \emph{Task-Centric Motion Priors} (TCMP), a task-priority adversarial imitation framework that treats imitation as a conditional regularizer rather than a co-equal objective. TCMP maximizes task improvement while incorporating imitation signals only when they are compatible with task progress, yielding an adaptive, geometry-aware update that preserves task-feasible descent and suppresses harmful imitation under misalignment. We provide theoretical analysis of gradient conflict and task-priority stationary points, and validate our claims through humanoid control experiments demonstrating robust task performance with consistent motion style under noisy demonstrations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19411v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NET4EXA: Pioneering the Future of Interconnects for Supercomputing and AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19413</link><description>arXiv:2601.19413v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The next step for In-vehicle Conversational Assistants (IVCAs) will be their capability to initiate and automate proactive system interactions throughout journeys. However, diverse drivers make it challenging to design voice interventions tailored towards individual on-road expectations. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) in design by implementing ProVoice: a Virtual Reality (VR) driving simulator integrating MOBO to investigate the effects of IVCA design variants on perceived mental demand, predictability, and usefulness. By reporting the Pareto Front from a within-subjects VR study (N=19), this paper proposes optimal design trade-offs. Follow-up analysis demonstrates MOBO's success in discovering effective intervention strategies, with reduced participant mental demand, alongside enhanced predictability and usefulness while engaging with the proactive IVCA. Implications for computational techniques in future research on proactive intervention strategies are discussed. ProVoice can extend to include alternative design parameters and driving scenarios, encouraging intervention design on a broad scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19421v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interior--Boundary Assortativity Profiles on Networks and Applications to SIS Epidemic Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19422</link><description>arXiv:2601.19422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce interior-boundary assortativity profiles as a structural refinement of Newman's assortativity coefficient and show that they arise naturally from epidemic dynamics on networks. Given a fixed partition of the node set, edges are stratified according to whether their endpoints are interior or boundary nodes relative to the partition, yielding type-restricted assortativity components. We prove an exact decomposition theorem showing how classical scalar assortativity collapses heterogeneous interior-boundary interactions into a single number. We then study a SIS epidemic model and consider equilibrium infection probabilities as node attributes. Under mild connectivity and positivity assumptions, we show that boundary dominance (a dynamical concentration of infection mass on interface nodes) implies a strictly negative boundary-to-interior assortativity component. This establishes a rigorous link between directed conductance, equilibrium flow geometry, and the sign structure of assortative mixing induced by the dynamics. Our results demonstrate that assortativity profiles encode dynamical information invisible to scalar summaries and provide a mathematically grounded bridge between network partition geometry and nonlinear dynamics on graphs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19422v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniRec: Unified Multimodal Encoding for LLM-Based Recommendations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19423</link><description>arXiv:2601.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have recently shown promise for multimodal recommendation, particularly with text and image inputs. Yet real-world recommendation signals extend far beyond these modalities. To reflect this, we formalize recommendation features into four modalities: text, images, categorical features, and numerical attributes, and highlight the unique challenges this heterogeneity poses for LLMs in understanding multimodal information. In particular, these challenges arise not only across modalities but also within them, as attributes such as price, rating, and time may all be numeric yet carry distinct semantic meanings. Beyond this intra-modality ambiguity, another major challenge is the nested structure of recommendation signals, where user histories are sequences of items, each associated with multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we propose UniRec, a unified multimodal encoder for LLM-based recommendation. UniRec first employs modality-specific encoders to produce consistent embeddings across heterogeneous signals. It then adopts a triplet representation, comprising attribute name, type, and value, to separate schema from raw inputs and preserve semantic distinctions. Finally, a hierarchical Q-Former models the nested structure of user interactions while maintaining their layered organization. Across multiple real-world benchmarks, UniRec outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and LLM-based recommenders by up to 15%, and extensive ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19423v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] It's Not Just a Phase: Creating Phase-Aligned Peripheral Metamers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19425</link><description>arXiv:2601.19425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel display technologies can deliver high-quality images across a wide field of view, creating immersive experiences. While rendering for such devices is expensive, most of the content falls into peripheral vision, where human perception differs from that in the fovea. Consequently, it is critical to understand and leverage the limitations of visual perception to enable efficient rendering. A standard approach is to exploit the reduced sensitivity to spatial details in the periphery by reducing rendering resolution, so-called foveated rendering. While this strategy avoids rendering part of the content altogether, an alternative promising direction is to replace accurate and expensive rendering with inexpensive synthesis of content that is perceptually indistinguishable from the ground-truth image. In this paper, we propose such a method for the efficient generation of an image signal that substitutes the rendering of high-frequency details. The method is grounded in findings from image statistics, which show that preserving appropriate local statistics is critical for perceived image quality. Based on this insight, we extrapolate several local image statistics from foveated content into higher spatial frequency ranges that are attenuated or omitted in the rendering process. This rich set of statistics is later used to synthesize a signal that is added to the initial rendering, boosting its perceived quality. We focus on phase information, demonstrating the importance of its alignment across space and frequencies. We calibrate and compare our method with state-of-the-art strategies, showing a significant reduction in the content that must be accurately rendered at a relatively small extra cost for synthesizing the additional signal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19425v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] For Generalised Algebraic Theories, Two Sorts Are Enough</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19426</link><description>arXiv:2601.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalised algebraic theories (GATs) allow multiple sorts indexed over each other. For example, the theories of categories or Martin-L{\"o}f type theories form GATs. Categories have two sorts, objects and morphisms, and the latter are double-indexed over the former. Martin-L{\"o}f type theory has four sorts: contexts, substitutions, types and terms. For example, types are indexed over contexts, and terms are indexed over both contexts and types. In this paper we show that any GAT can be reduced to a GAT with only two sorts, and there is a section-retraction correspondence (formally, a strict coreflection) between models of the original and the reduced GAT. In particular, any model of the original GAT can be turned into a model of the reduced (two-sorted) GAT and back, and this roundtrip is the identity.
  The reduced GAT is simpler than the original GAT in the following aspects: it does not have sort equalities; it does not have interleaved sorts and operations; if the original GAT did not have interleaved sorts and operations, then the reduced GAT won't have operations interleaved between different sorts. In a type-theoretic metatheory, the initial algebra of a GAT is called a quotient inductive-inductive type (QIIT). Our reduction provides a way to implement QIITs with sort equalities or interleaved constructors which are not allowed by Cubical Agda. An instance of our reduction is the well-known method of reducing mutual inductive types to a single indexed family. Our approach is semantic in that it does not rely on a syntactic description of GATs, but instead, on Uemura's bi-initial characterisation of the category of (finite) GATs in the 2-category of finitely complete categories with a chosen exponentiable morphism.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19426v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling Perceptual Artifacts: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Interpretable AI-Generated Image Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19430</link><description>arXiv:2601.19430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current AI-Generated Image (AIGI) detection approaches predominantly rely on binary classification to distinguish real from synthetic images, often lacking interpretable or convincing evidence to substantiate their decisions. This limitation stems from existing AIGI detection benchmarks, which, despite featuring a broad collection of synthetic images, remain restricted in their coverage of artifact diversity and lack detailed, localized annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained benchmark towards eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection, named X-AIGD, which provides pixel-level, categorized annotations of perceptual artifacts, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals. These comprehensive annotations facilitate fine-grained interpretability evaluation and deeper insight into model decision-making processes. Our extensive investigation using X-AIGD provides several key insights: (1) Existing AIGI detectors demonstrate negligible reliance on perceptual artifacts, even at the most basic distortion level. (2) While AIGI detectors can be trained to identify specific artifacts, they still substantially base their judgment on uninterpretable features.

Abstract: Generating immersive 3D scenes from texts is a core task in computer vision, crucial for applications in virtual reality and game development. Despite the promise of leveraging 2D diffusion priors, existing methods suffer from spatial blindness and rely on predefined trajectories that fail to exploit the inner relationships among salient objects. Consequently, these approaches are unable to comprehend the semantic layout, preventing them from exploring the scene adaptively to infer occluded content. Moreover, current inpainting models operate in 2D image space, struggling to plausibly fill holes caused by camera motion. To address these limitations, we propose RoamScene3D, a novel framework that bridges the gap between semantic guidance and spatial generation. Our method reasons about the semantic relations among objects and produces consistent and photorealistic scenes. Specifically, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to construct a scene graph that encodes object relations, guiding the camera to perceive salient object boundaries and plan an adaptive roaming trajectory. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitations of static 2D priors, we introduce a Motion-Injected Inpainting model that is fine-tuned on a synthetic panoramic dataset integrating authentic camera trajectories, making it adaptive to camera motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with semantic reasoning and geometric constraints, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in producing consistent and photorealistic scenes.

Abstract: Sustainable monetization of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical open challenge. Traditional search advertising, which relies on static keywords, fails to capture the fleeting, context-dependent user intents--the specific information, goods, or services a user seeks--embedded in conversational flows. Beyond the standard goal of social welfare maximization, effective LLM advertising imposes additional requirements on contextual coherence (ensuring ads align semantically with transient user intents) and computational efficiency (avoiding user interaction latency), as well as adherence to ethical and regulatory standards, including preserving privacy and ensuring explicit ad disclosure. Although various recent solutions have explored bidding on token-level and query-level, both categories of approaches generally fail to holistically satisfy this multifaceted set of constraints.
  We propose a practical framework that resolves these tensions through two decoupling strategies. First, we decouple ad insertion from response generation to ensure safety and explicit disclosure. Second, we decouple bidding from specific user queries by using ``genres'' (high-level semantic clusters) as a proxy. This allows advertisers to bid on stable categories rather than sensitive real-time response, reducing computational burden and privacy risks. We demonstrate that applying the VCG auction mechanism to this genre-based framework yields approximately dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) and individual rationality (IR), as well as approximately optimal social welfare, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Finally, we introduce an "LLM-as-a-Judge" metric to estimate contextual coherence. Our experiments show that this metric correlates strongly with human ratings (Spearman's $\rho\approx 0.66$), outperforming 80% of individual human evaluators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19435v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OSIRIS: Bridging Analog Circuit Design and Machine Learning with Scalable Dataset Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19439</link><description>arXiv:2601.19439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DSTCS: Dual-Student Teacher Framework with Segment Anything Model for Semi-Supervised Pubic Symphysis Fetal Head Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19446</link><description>arXiv:2601.19446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of the pubic symphysis and fetal head (PSFH) is a critical procedure in intrapartum monitoring and is essential for evaluating labor progression and identifying potential delivery complications. However, achieving accurate segmentation remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance, ambiguous boundaries, and noise interference in ultrasound images, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture. A cooperative learning mechanism between the CNN and SAM branches significantly improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme also incorporates a specialized data augmentation strategy optimized for boundary processing and a novel loss function. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI 2023 and 2024 PSFH segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method exhibits superior robustness and significantly outperforms existing techniques, providing a reliable segmentation tool for clinical practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19446v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KG-CRAFT: Knowledge Graph-based Contrastive Reasoning with LLMs for Enhancing Automated Fact-checking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19447</link><description>arXiv:2601.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Claim verification is a core component of automated fact-checking systems, aimed at determining the truthfulness of a statement by assessing it against reliable evidence sources such as documents or knowledge bases. This work presents KG-CRAFT, a method that improves automatic claim verification by leveraging large language models (LLMs) augmented with contrastive questions grounded in a knowledge graph. KG-CRAFT first constructs a knowledge graph from claims and associated reports, then formulates contextually relevant contrastive questions based on the knowledge graph structure. These questions guide the distillation of evidence-based reports, which are synthesised into a concise summary that is used for veracity assessment by LLMs. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets (LIAR-RAW and RAWFC) demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in predictive performance. Comprehensive analyses validate in detail the effectiveness of our knowledge graph-based contrastive reasoning approach in improving LLMs' fact-checking capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19447v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Internal Diagnosis to External Auditing: A VLM-Driven Paradigm for Online Test-Time Backdoor Defense</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19448</link><description>arXiv:2601.19448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks remain inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Traditional test-time defenses largely operate under the paradigm of internal diagnosis methods like model repairing or input robustness, yet these approaches are often fragile under advanced attacks as they remain entangled with the victim model's corrupted parameters. We propose a paradigm shift from Internal Diagnosis to External Semantic Auditing, arguing that effective defense requires decoupling safety from the victim model via an independent, semantically grounded auditor. To this end, we present a framework harnessing Universal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as evolving semantic gatekeepers. We introduce PRISM (Prototype Refinement &amp; Inspection via Statistical Monitoring), which overcomes the domain gap of general VLMs through two key mechanisms: a Hybrid VLM Teacher that dynamically refines visual prototypes online, and an Adaptive Router powered by statistical margin monitoring to calibrate gating thresholds in real-time. Extensive evaluation across 17 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrates that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance, suppressing Attack Success Rate to &lt;1% on CIFAR-10 while improving clean accuracy, establishing a new standard for model-agnostic, externalized security.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19448v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fixed Aggregation Features Can Rival GNNs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19449</link><description>arXiv:2601.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely believed to excel at node representation learning through trainable neighborhood aggregations. We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19449v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Multi-Expert Projectors with Stabilized Routing for Multilingual Speech Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19451</link><description>arXiv:2601.19451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based ASR connect frozen speech encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs) via lightweight projectors. While effective in monolingual settings, a single projector struggles to capture the diverse acoustic-to-semantic mappings required for multilingual ASR. To address this, we propose SMEAR-MoE, a stabilized Mixture-of-Experts projector that ensures dense gradient flow to all experts, preventing expert collapse while enabling cross-lingual sharing. We systematically compare monolithic, static multi-projector, and dynamic MoE designs across four Indic languages (Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu). Our SMEAR-MoE achieves strong performance, delivering upto a 7.6% relative WER reduction over the single-projector baseline, while maintaining comparable runtime efficiency. Analysis of expert routing further shows linguistically meaningful specialization, with related languages sharing experts. These results demonstrate that stable multi-expert projectors are key to scalable and robust multilingual ASR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19451v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] APC-RL: Exceeding Data-Driven Behavior Priors with Adaptive Policy Composition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19452</link><description>arXiv:2601.19452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating demonstration data into reinforcement learning (RL) can greatly accelerate learning, but existing approaches often assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task. In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19452v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Gold-Standard Depth Estimation for Tree Branches in UAV Forestry: Benchmarking Deep Stereo Matching Methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19461</link><description>arXiv:2601.19461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75). DEFOM predictions will serve as pseudo-ground-truth for future benchmarking.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19461v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physical Human-Robot Interaction: A Critical Review of Safety Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19462</link><description>arXiv:2601.19462v1 Announce Type: new

Numerical examples are provided to quantify performance degradation induced by common approximations and simplifying design choices.

Abstract: Indexed languages are a classical notion in formal language theory, which has attracted attention in recent decades due to its role in higher-order model checking: They are precisely the languages accepted by order-2 pushdown automata. The downward closure of an indexed language -- the set of all (scattered) subwords of its members -- is well-known to be a regular over-approximation. It was shown by Zetzsche (ICALP 2015) that the downward closure of a given indexed language is effectively computable. However, the algorithm comes with no complexity bounds, and it has remained open whether a primitive-recursive construction exists. We settle this question and provide a triply (resp.\ quadruply) exponential construction of a non-deterministic (resp.\ deterministic) automaton. We also prove (asymptotically) matching lower bounds. For the upper bounds, we rely on recent advances in semigroup theory, which let us compute bounded-size summaries of words with respect to a finite semigroup. By replacing stacks with their summaries, we are able to transform an indexed grammar into a context-free one with the same downward closure, and then apply existing bounds for context-free grammars.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19466v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Expressiveness of State Space Models via Temporal Logics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19467</link><description>arXiv:2601.19467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the expressive power of state space models (SSM), which have recently emerged as a potential alternative to transformer architectures in large language models. Building on recent work, we analyse SSM expressiveness through fragments and extensions of linear temporal logic over finite traces. Our results show that the expressive capabilities of SSM vary substantially depending on the underlying gating mechanism. We further distinguish between SSM operating over fixed-width arithmetic (quantised models), whose expressive power remains within regular languages, and SSM with unbounded precision, which can capture counting properties and non-regular languages. In addition, we provide a systematic comparison between these different SSM variants and known results on transformers, thereby clarifying how the two architectures relate in terms of expressive power.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19467v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dual-Strategy-Enhanced ConBiMamba for Neural Speaker Diarization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19472</link><description>arXiv:2601.19472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformer and Mamba have achieved strong performance in speech modeling but face limitations in speaker diarization. Mamba is efficient but struggles with local details and nonlinear patterns. Conformer's self-attention incurs high memory overhead for long speech sequences and may cause instability in long-range dependency modeling. These limitations are critical for diarization, which requires both precise modeling of local variations and robust speaker consistency over extended spans. To address these challenges, we first apply ConBiMamba for speaker diarization. We follow the Pyannote pipeline and propose the Dual-Strategy-Enhanced ConBiMamba neural speaker diarization system. ConBiMamba integrates the strengths of Conformer and Mamba, where Conformer's convolutional and feed-forward structures are utilized to improve local feature extraction. By replacing Conformer's self-attention with ExtBiMamba, ConBiMamba efficiently handles long audio sequences while alleviating the high memory cost of self-attention. Furthermore, to address the problem of the higher DER around speaker change points, we introduce the Boundary-Enhanced Transition Loss to enhance the detection of speaker change points. We also propose Layer-wise Feature Aggregation to enhance the utilization of multi-layer representations. The system is evaluated on six diarization datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four of them.

Abstract: Informed down-sampling (IDS) is known to improve performance in symbolic regression when combined with various selection strategies, especially tournament selection. However, recent work found that IDS's gains are not consistent across all problems. Our analysis reveals that IDS performance is worse for problems containing outliers. IDS systematically favors including outliers in subsets which pushes GP towards finding solutions that overfit to outliers. To address this, we introduce ROIDS (Robust Outlier-Aware Informed Down-Sampling), which excludes potential outliers from the sampling process of IDS. With ROIDS it is possible to keep the advantages of IDS without overfitting to outliers and to compete on a wide range of benchmark problems. This is also reflected in our experiments in which ROIDS shows the desired behavior on all studied benchmark problems. ROIDS consistently outperforms IDS on synthetic problems with added outliers as well as on a wide range of complex real-world problems, surpassing IDS on over 80% of the real-world benchmark problems. Moreover, compared to all studied baseline approaches, ROIDS achieves the best average rank across all tested benchmark problems. This robust behavior makes ROIDS a reliable down-sampling method for selection in symbolic regression, especially when outliers may be included in the data set.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19477v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Time-to-Injury Forecasting in Elite Female Football: A DeepHit Survival Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19479</link><description>arXiv:2601.19479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Injury occurrence in football poses significant challenges for athletes and teams, carrying personal, competitive, and financial consequences. While machine learning has been applied to injury prediction before, existing approaches often rely on static pre-season data and binary outcomes, limiting their real-world utility. This study investigates the feasibility of using a DeepHit neural network to forecast time-to-injury from longitudinal athlete monitoring data, while providing interpretable predictions. The analysis utilised the publicly available SoccerMon dataset, containing two seasons of training, match, and wellness records from elite female footballers. Data was pre-processed through cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of three imputation strategies. Baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) were optimised via grid search for benchmarking, while the DeepHit model, implemented with a multilayer perceptron backbone, was evaluated using chronological and leave-one-player-out (LOPO) validation. DeepHit achieved a concordance index of 0.762, outperforming baseline models and delivering individualised, time-varying risk estimates. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified clinically relevant predictors consistent with established risk factors, enhancing interpretability. Overall, this study provides a novel proof of concept: survival modelling with DeepHit shows strong potential to advance injury forecasting in football, offering accurate, explainable, and actionable insights for injury prevention across competitive levels.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19479v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Worlds, Dynamic Humans: Generating Virtual Human-Scene Interaction Motion in Dynamic Scenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19484</link><description>arXiv:2601.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scenes are continuously undergoing dynamic changes in the real world. However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization. (3) Control (human body): we equip the virtual human with Human-Scene Interaction Diffusion Model, which generates high-fidelity interaction motions conditioned on multimodal inputs. To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate Dyn-HSI, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and generates high-quality human-scene interaction motions in both static and dynamic settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19484v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-VA: Resolving the Jailbreak-Overrefusal Trade-off via Vector Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19487</link><description>arXiv:2601.19487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from two failure modes: jailbreak (answering harmful inputs) and over-refusal (declining benign queries). Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) architectures have achieved significant successes in LLMs, inspiring explorations for video generation. In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual quality and structural stability compared to static top-k/top-p strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19488v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast Converging 3D Gaussian Splatting for 1-Minute Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19489</link><description>arXiv:2601.19489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast 3DGS reconstruction pipeline designed to converge within one minute, developed for the SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS Fast Reconstruction Challenge. The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19489v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ClaimPT: A Portuguese Dataset of Annotated Claims in News Articles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19490</link><description>arXiv:2601.19490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fact-checking remains a demanding and time-consuming task, still largely dependent on manual verification and unable to match the rapid spread of misinformation online. This is particularly important because debunking false information typically takes longer to reach consumers than the misinformation itself; accelerating corrections through automation can therefore help counter it more effectively. Although many organizations perform manual fact-checking, this approach is difficult to scale given the growing volume of digital content. These limitations have motivated interest in automating fact-checking, where identifying claims is a crucial first step. However, progress has been uneven across languages, with English dominating due to abundant annotated data. Portuguese, like other languages, still lacks accessible, licensed datasets, limiting research, NLP developments and applications. In this paper, we introduce ClaimPT, a dataset of European Portuguese news articles annotated for factual claims, comprising 1,308 articles and 6,875 individual annotations. Unlike most existing resources based on social media or parliamentary transcripts, ClaimPT focuses on journalistic content, collected through a partnership with LUSA, the Portuguese News Agency. To ensure annotation quality, two trained annotators labeled each article, with a curator validating all annotations according to a newly proposed scheme. We also provide baseline models for claim detection, establishing initial benchmarks and enabling future NLP and IR applications. By releasing ClaimPT, we aim to advance research on low-resource fact-checking and enhance understanding of misinformation in news media.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19490v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AACR-Bench: Evaluating Automatic Code Review with Holistic Repository-Level Context</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19494</link><description>arXiv:2601.19494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality evaluation benchmarks are pivotal for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Code Review (ACR). However, existing benchmarks suffer from two critical limitations: first, the lack of multi-language support in repository-level contexts, which restricts the generalizability of evaluation results; second, the reliance on noisy, incomplete ground truth derived from raw Pull Request (PR) comments, which constrains the scope of issue detection. To address these challenges, we introduce AACR-Bench a comprehensive benchmark that provides full cross-file context across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional datasets, AACR-Bench employs an "AI-assisted, Expert-verified" annotation pipeline to uncover latent defects often overlooked in original PRs, resulting in a 285\% increase in defect coverage. Extensive evaluations of mainstream LLMs on AACR-Bench reveal that previous assessments may have either misjudged or only partially captured model capabilities due to data limitations. Our work establishes a more rigorous standard for ACR evaluation and offers new insights on LLM based ACR, i.e., the granularity/level of context and the choice of retrieval methods significantly impact ACR performance, and this influence varies depending on the LLM, programming language, and the LLM usage paradigm e.g., whether an Agent architecture is employed.

Abstract: For lattice modular self-reconfigurable robots (MSRRs), maintaining stable connections during reconfiguration is crucial for physical feasibility and deployability. This letter presents a novel self-reconfiguration planning algorithm for deformable quadrilateral MSRRs that guarantees stable connection. The method first constructs feasible connect/disconnect actions using a virtual graph representation, and then organizes these actions into a valid execution sequence through a Dependence-based Reverse Tree (DRTree) that resolves interdependencies. We also prove that reconfiguration sequences satisfying motion characteristics exist for any pair of configurations with seven or more modules (excluding linear topologies). Finally, comparisons with a modified BiRRT algorithm highlight the superior efficiency and stability of our approach, while deployment on a physical robotic platform confirms its practical feasibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19496v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cortex-Grounded Diffusion Models for Brain Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19498</link><description>arXiv:2601.19498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage. However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19498v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Learning Goal-Reaching Control with Guaranteed Lyapunov-Like Stabilizer for Mobile Robots</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19499</link><description>arXiv:2601.19499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can be highly effective at learning goal-reaching policies, but it typically does not provide formal guarantees that the goal will always be reached. A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19499v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reuse of Public Keys Across UTXO and Account-Based Cryptocurrencies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19500</link><description>arXiv:2601.19500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that reusing cryptocurrency addresses undermines privacy. This also applies if the same addresses are used in different cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, cross-chain address reuse appears to be a recurring phenomenon, especially in EVM-based designs. Previous works performed either direct address matching, or basic format conversion, to identify such cases. However, seemingly incompatible address formats e.g., in Bitcoin and Ethereum, can also be derived from the same public keys, since they rely on the same cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we therefore focus on the underlying public keys to discover reuse within, as well as across, different cryptocurrency networks, enabling us to also match incompatible address formats. Specifically, we analyze key reuse across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Zcash and Tron. Our results reveal that cryptographic keys are extensively and actively reused across these networks, negatively impacting both privacy and security of their users. We are hence the first to expose and quantify cross-chain key reuse between UTXO and account-based cryptocurrencies. Moreover, we devise novel clustering methods across these different cryptocurrency networks that do not rely on heuristics and instead link entities by their knowledge of the underlying secret key.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19500v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19501</link><description>arXiv:2601.19501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) typically first quantizes continuous item embeddings into multi-level semantic IDs (SIDs), and then generates the next item via autoregressive decoding. Although existing methods are already competitive in terms of recommendation performance, directly inheriting the autoregressive decoding paradigm from language models still suffers from three key limitations: (1) autoregressive decoding struggles to jointly capture global dependencies among the multi-dimensional features associated with different positions of SID; (2) using a unified, fixed decoding path for the same item implicitly assumes that all users attend to item attributes in the same order; (3) autoregressive decoding is inefficient at inference time and struggles to meet real-time requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose MDGR, a Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation framework that reshapes the GR pipeline from three perspectives: codebook, training, and inference. (1) We adopt a parallel codebook to provide a structural foundation for diffusion-based GR. (2) During training, we adaptively construct masking supervision signals along both the temporal and sample dimensions. (3) During inference, we develop a warm-up-based two-stage parallel decoding strategy for efficient generation of SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and industrial-scale datasets show that MDGR outperforms ten state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.78%. Furthermore, by deploying MDGR on a large-scale online advertising platform, we achieve a 1.20% increase in revenue, demonstrating its practical value. The code will be released upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19501v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VisGuardian: A Lightweight Group-based Privacy Control Technique For Front Camera Data From AR Glasses in Home Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19502</link><description>arXiv:2601.19502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Always-on sensing of AI applications on AR glasses makes traditional permission techniques ill-suited for context-dependent visual data, especially within home environments. The home presents a highly challenging privacy context due to the high density of sensitive objects, and the frequent presence of non-consenting family members, and the intimate nature of daily routines, making it a critical focus area for scalable privacy control mechanisms. Existing fine-grained controls, while offering nuanced choices, are inefficient for managing multiple private objects. We propose VisGuardian, a fine-grained content-based visual permission technique for AR glasses. VisGuardian features a group-based control mechanism that enables users to efficiently manage permissions for multiple private objects. VisGuardian detects objects using YOLO and adopts a pre-classified schema to group them. By selecting a single object, users can efficiently obscure groups of related objects based on criteria including privacy sensitivity, object category, or spatial proximity. A technical evaluation shows VisGuardian achieves mAP50 of 0.6704 with only 14.0 ms latency and a 1.7% increase in battery consumption per hour. Furthermore, a user study (N=24) comparing VisGuardian to slider-based and object-based baselines found it to be significantly faster for setting permissions and was preferred by users for its efficiency, effectiveness, and ease of use.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19502v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GradPruner: Gradient-Guided Layer Pruning Enabling Efficient Fine-Tuning and Inference for LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19503</link><description>arXiv:2601.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with downstream data is often considered time-consuming and expensive. Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy. Our code is publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19503v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Information Asymmetry: A Hierarchical Framework for Deterministic Blind Face Restoration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19506</link><description>arXiv:2601.19506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19506v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated Safety Benchmarking: A Multi-agent Pipeline for LVLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19507</link><description>arXiv:2601.19507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in cross-modal tasks but face significant safety challenges, which undermine their reliability in real-world applications. Efforts have been made to build LVLM safety evaluation benchmarks to uncover their vulnerability. However, existing benchmarks are hindered by their labor-intensive construction process, static complexity, and limited discriminative power. Thus, they may fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving models and emerging risks. To address these limitations, we propose VLSafetyBencher, the first automated system for LVLM safety benchmarking. VLSafetyBencher introduces four collaborative agents: Data Preprocessing, Generation, Augmentation, and Selection agents to construct and select high-quality samples. Experiments validates that VLSafetyBencher can construct high-quality safety benchmarks within one week at a minimal cost. The generated benchmark effectively distinguish safety, with a safety rate disparity of 70% between the most and least safe models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19507v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Intelligence: Brain-like Neuron Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19508</link><description>arXiv:2601.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since their inception, artificial neural networks have relied on manually designed architectures and inductive biases to better adapt to data and tasks. With the rise of deep learning and the expansion of parameter spaces, they have begun to exhibit brain-like functional behaviors. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks remain fundamentally different from biological neural systems in structural organization, learning mechanisms, and evolutionary pathways.
  From the perspective of neuroscience, we rethink the formation and evolution of intelligence and proposes a new neural network paradigm, Brain-like Neural Network (BNN). We further present the first instantiation of a BNN termed LuminaNet that operates without convolutions or self-attention and is capable of autonomously modifying its architecture. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that LuminaNet can achieve self-evolution through dynamic architectural changes. On the CIFAR-10, LuminaNet achieves top-1 accuracy improvements of 11.19%, 5.46% over LeNet-5 and AlexNet, respectively, outperforming MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, and DeiT-Tiny among MLP/ViT architectures. On the TinyStories text generation task, LuminaNet attains a perplexity of 8.4, comparable to a single-layer GPT-2-style Transformer, while reducing computational cost by approximately 25% and peak memory usage by nearly 50%.

Abstract: In underwater navigation systems, strap-down inertial navigation system/Doppler velocity log (SINS/DVL)-based loosely coupled architectures are widely adopted. Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19509v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ALRM: Agentic LLM for Robotic Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19510</link><description>arXiv:2601.19510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently empowered agentic frameworks to exhibit advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their integration in robotic control pipelines remains limited in two aspects: (1) prior \ac{llm}-based approaches often lack modular, agentic execution mechanisms, limiting their ability to plan, reflect on outcomes, and revise actions in a closed-loop manner; and (2) existing benchmarks for manipulation tasks focus on low-level control and do not systematically evaluate multistep reasoning and linguistic variation. In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution. Results reveal Claude-4.1-Opus as the top closed-source model and Falcon-H1-7B as the top open-source model under CaP.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19510v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Academic Paper Recommendations Using Fine-Grained Knowledge Entities and Multifaceted Document Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19513</link><description>arXiv:2601.19513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of explosive growth in academic literature, the burden of literature review on scholars are increasing. Proactively recommending academic papers that align with scholars' literature needs in the research process has become one of the crucial pathways to enhance research efficiency and stimulate innovative thinking. Current academic paper recommendation systems primarily focus on broad and coarse-grained suggestions based on general topic or field similarities. While these systems effectively identify related literature, they fall short in addressing scholars' more specific and fine-grained needs, such as locating papers that utilize particular research methods, or tackle distinct research tasks within the same topic. To meet the diverse and specific literature needs of scholars in the research process, this paper proposes a novel academic paper recommendation method. This approach embeds multidimensional information by integrating new types of fine-grained knowledge entities, title and abstract of document, and citation data. Recommendations are then generated by calculating the similarity between combined paper vectors. The proposed recommendation method was evaluated using the STM-KG dataset, a knowledge graph that incorporates scientific concepts derived from papers across ten distinct domains. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving an average precision of 27.3% among the top 50 recommendations. This represents an improvement of 6.7% over existing approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19513v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PALM: Enhanced Generalizability for Local Visuomotor Policies via Perception Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19514</link><description>arXiv:2601.19514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing beyond the training domain in image-based behavior cloning remains challenging. Existing methods address individual axes of generalization, workspace shifts, viewpoint changes, and cross-embodiment transfer, yet they are typically developed in isolation and often rely on complex pipelines. We introduce PALM (Perception Alignment for Local Manipulation), which leverages the invariance of local action distributions between out-of-distribution (OOD) and demonstrated domains to address these OOD shifts concurrently, without additional input modalities, model changes, or data collection. PALM modularizes the manipulation policy into coarse global components and a local policy for fine-grained actions. We reduce the discrepancy between in-domain and OOD inputs at the local policy level by enforcing local visual focus and consistent proprioceptive representation, allowing the policy to retrieve invariant local actions under OOD conditions. Experiments show that PALM limits OOD performance drops to 8% in simulation and 24% in the real world, compared to 45% and 77% for baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19514v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mocap Anywhere: Towards Pairwise-Distance based Motion Capture in the Wild (for the Wild)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19519</link><description>arXiv:2601.19519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel motion capture system that reconstructs full-body 3D motion using only sparse pairwise distance (PWD) measurements from body-mounted(UWB) sensors. Using time-of-flight ranging between wireless nodes, our method eliminates the need for external cameras, enabling robust operation in uncontrolled and outdoor environments. Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild. Our empirical analysis highlights its potential for scalable, low-cost, and general purpose motion capture in real-world settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19519v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Non-Invasive 3D Gait Analysis Framework for Quantifying Psychomotor Retardation in Major Depressive Disorder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19526</link><description>arXiv:2601.19526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the status of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) from objective, non-invasive methods is an active research field. Yet, extracting automatically objective, interpretable features for a detailed analysis of the patient state remains largely unexplored.
  Among MDD's symptoms, Psychomotor retardation (PMR) is a core item, yet its clinical assessment remains largely subjective. While 3D motion capture offers an objective alternative, its reliance on specialized hardware often precludes routine clinical use. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive computational framework that transforms monocular RGB video into clinically relevant 3D gait kinematics. Our pipeline uses Gravity-View Coordinates along with a novel trajectory-correction algorithm that leverages the closed-loop topology of our adapted Timed Up and Go (TUG) protocol to mitigate monocular depth errors. This novel pipeline enables the extraction of 297 explicit gait biomechanical biomarkers from a single camera capture.
  To address the challenges of small clinical datasets, we introduce a stability-based machine learning framework that identifies robust motor signatures while preventing overfitting. Validated on the CALYPSO dataset, our method achieves an 83.3% accuracy in detecting PMR and explains 64% of the variance in overall depression severity (R^2=0.64). Notably, our study reveals a strong link between reduced ankle propulsion and restricted pelvic mobility to the depressive motor phenotype. These results demonstrate that physical movement serves as a robust proxy for the cognitive state, offering a transparent and scalable tool for the objective monitoring of depression in standard clinical environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19526v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fuzzy expert system for the process of collecting and purifying acidic water: a digital twin approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19527</link><description>arXiv:2601.19527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rhombot: Rhombus-shaped Modular Robots for Stable, Medium-Independent Reconfiguration Motion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19529</link><description>arXiv:2601.19529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Rhombot, a novel deformable planar lattice modular self-reconfigurable robot (MSRR) with a rhombus shaped module. Each module consists of a parallelogram skeleton with a single centrally mounted actuator that enables folding and unfolding along its diagonal. The core design philosophy is to achieve essential MSRR functionalities such as morphing, docking, and locomotion with minimal control complexity. This enables a continuous and stable reconfiguration process that is independent of the surrounding medium, allowing the system to reliably form various configurations in diverse environments. To leverage the unique kinematics of Rhombot, we introduce morphpivoting, a novel motion primitive for reconfiguration that differs from advanced MSRR systems, and propose a strategy for its continuous execution. Finally, a series of physical experiments validate the module's stable reconfiguration ability, as well as its positional and docking accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19529v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarks Saturate When The Model Gets Smarter Than The Judge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19532</link><description>arXiv:2601.19532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19532v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SLM-SS: Speech Language Model for Generative Speech Separation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19533</link><description>arXiv:2601.19533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech separation (SS) has advanced significantly with neural network-based methods, showing improved performance on signal-level metrics. However, these methods often struggle to maintain speech intelligibility in the separated signals, which can negatively affect the performance of downstream tasks such as speech recognition. In this work, we propose SLM-SS, a novel approach that applies speech language models to SS, aiming to enhance the intelligibility and coherence of the separated signals. We frame SS as discrete multi-codebook sequence generation, using Encoder-Decoder models to map quantized speech mixtures to target tokens. In addition to the autoregressive modeling strategy, we introduce a non-autoregressive model to improve decoding efficiency for residual tokens. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset demonstrate that our approach shows significantly better preservation of speech intelligibility, leading to improved linguistic consistency in a variety of downstream tasks compared to existing approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19533v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LURE-RAG: Lightweight Utility-driven Reranking for Efficient RAG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19535</link><description>arXiv:2601.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on relevance-based retrieval, which often misaligns with utility -- that is, whether the retrieved passages actually improve the quality of the generated text specific to a downstream task such as question answering or query-based summarization. The limitations of existing utility-driven retrieval approaches for RAG are that, firstly, they are resource-intensive typically requiring query encoding, and that secondly, they do not involve listwise ranking loss during training. The latter limitation is particularly critical, as the relative order between documents directly affects generation in RAG. To address this gap, we propose Lightweight Utility-driven Reranking for Efficient RAG (LURE-RAG), a framework that augments any black-box retriever with an efficient LambdaMART-based reranker. Unlike prior methods, LURE-RAG trains the reranker with a listwise ranking loss guided by LLM utility, thereby directly optimizing the ordering of retrieved documents. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that LURE-RAG achieves competitive performance, reaching 97-98% of the state-of-the-art dense neural baseline, while remaining efficient in both training and inference. Moreover, its dense variant, UR-RAG, significantly outperforms the best existing baseline by up to 3%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Inverse Perspective Mapping for Automatic Vectorized Road Map Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19536</link><description>arXiv:2601.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a low-cost and unified framework for vectorized road mapping leveraging enhanced inverse perspective mapping (IPM). In this framework, Catmull-Rom splines are utilized to characterize lane lines, and all the other ground markings are depicted using polygons uniformly. The results from instance segmentation serve as references to refine the three-dimensional position of spline control points and polygon corner points. In conjunction with this process, the homography matrix of IPM and vehicle poses are optimized simultaneously. Our proposed framework significantly reduces the mapping errors associated with IPM. It also improves the accuracy of the initial IPM homography matrix and the predicted vehicle poses. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations imposed by the coplanarity assumption in IPM. These enhancements enable IPM to be effectively applied to vectorized road mapping, which serves a cost-effective solution with enhanced accuracy. In addition, our framework generalizes road map elements to include all common ground markings and lane lines. The proposed framework is evaluated in two different practical scenarios, and the test results show that our method can automatically generate high-precision maps with near-centimeter-level accuracy. Importantly, the optimized IPM matrix achieves an accuracy comparable to that of manual calibration, while the accuracy of vehicle poses is also significantly improved.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19536v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Do I Trust the AI?"

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown considerable potential in supporting medical diagnosis. However, their effective integration into clinical workflows is hindered by physicians' difficulties in perceiving and trusting LLM capabilities, which often results in miscalibrated trust. Existing model evaluations primarily emphasize standardized benchmarks and predefined tasks, offering limited insights into clinical reasoning practices. Moreover, research on human-AI collaboration has rarely examined physicians' perceptions of LLMs' clinical reasoning capability. In this work, we investigate how physicians perceive LLMs' capabilities in the clinical reasoning process. We designed clinical cases, collected the corresponding analyses, and obtained evaluations from physicians (N=37) to quantitatively represent their perceived LLM diagnostic capabilities. By comparing the perceived evaluations with benchmark performance, our study highlights the aspects of clinical reasoning that physicians value and underscores the limitations of benchmark-based evaluation. We further discuss the implications of opportunities for enhancing trustworthy collaboration between physicians and LLMs in LLM-supported clinical reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19540v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GenCP: Towards Generative Modeling Paradigm of Coupled Physics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19541</link><description>arXiv:2601.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world physical systems are inherently complex, often involving the coupling of multiple physics, making their simulation both highly valuable and challenging. Many mainstream approaches face challenges when dealing with decoupled data. Besides, they also suffer from low efficiency and fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal physical systems. Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this "conditional-to-joint" sampling scheme. We evaluate our paradigm on a synthetic setting and three challenging multi-physics scenarios to demonstrate both principled insight and superior application performance of GenCP.

Abstract: Software architecture is inherently knowledge-centric. The architectural knowledge is distributed across heterogeneous software artifacts such as requirements documents, design diagrams, code, and documentation, making it difficult for developers to access and utilize this knowledge effectively. Moreover, as systems evolve, inconsistencies frequently emerge between these artifacts, leading to architectural erosion and impeding maintenance activities. We envision an automated pipeline that systematically extracts architectural knowledge from diverse artifacts, links them, identifies and resolves inconsistencies, and consolidates this knowledge into a structured knowledge base. This knowledge base enables critical activities such as architecture conformance checking and change impact analysis, while supporting natural language question-answering to improve access to architectural knowledge. To realize this vision, we plan to develop specialized extractors for different artifact types, design a unified knowledge representation schema, implement consistency checking mechanisms, and integrate retrieval-augmented generation techniques for conversational knowledge access.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19548v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scale-Consistent State-Space Dynamics via Fractal of Stationary Transformations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19551</link><description>arXiv:2601.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent deep learning models increasingly rely on depth without structural guarantees on the validity of intermediate representations, rendering early stopping and adaptive computation ill-posed. We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19551v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The S3LI Vulcano Dataset: A Dataset for Multi-Modal SLAM in Unstructured Planetary Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19557</link><description>arXiv:2601.19557v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of a large language model (LLM) based semantic search tool relative to a traditional keyword-based search for data discovery. Using real-world search behaviour, we compare outputs from a bespoke semantic search system applied to UKRI data services with the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) keyword search. Analysis is based on 131 of the most frequently used search terms extracted from CDRC search logs between December 2023 and October 2024. We assess differences in the volume, overlap, ranking, and relevance of returned datasets using descriptive statistics, qualitative inspection, and quantitative similarity measures, including exact dataset overlap, Jaccard similarity, and cosine similarity derived from BERT embeddings. Results show that the semantic search consistently returns a larger number of results than the keyword search and performs particularly well for place based, misspelled, obscure, or complex queries. While the semantic search does not capture all keyword based results, the datasets returned are overwhelmingly semantically similar, with high cosine similarity scores despite lower exact overlap. Rankings of the most relevant results differ substantially between tools, reflecting contrasting prioritisation strategies. Case studies demonstrate that the LLM based tool is robust to spelling errors, interprets geographic and contextual relevance effectively, and supports natural-language queries that keyword search fails to resolve. Overall, the findings suggest that LLM driven semantic search offers a substantial improvement for data discovery, complementing rather than fully replacing traditional keyword-based approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19559v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AROMMA: Unifying Olfactory Embeddings for Single Molecules and Mixtures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19561</link><description>arXiv:2601.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public olfaction datasets are small and fragmented across single molecules and mixtures, limiting learning of generalizable odor representations. Recent works either learn single-molecule embeddings or address mixtures via similarity or pairwise label prediction, leaving representations separate and unaligned. In this work, we propose AROMMA, a framework that learns a unified embedding space for single molecules and two-molecule mixtures. Each molecule is encoded by a chemical foundation model and the mixtures are composed by an attention-based aggregator, ensuring both permutation invariance and asymmetric molecular interactions. We further align odor descriptor sets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations. AROMMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, demonstrating a robust generalization in two domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19561v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tournament Informed Adversarial Quality Diversity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19562</link><description>arXiv:2601.19562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) is a branch of evolutionary computation that seeks high-quality and behaviorally diverse solutions to a problem. While adversarial problems are common, classical QD cannot be easily applied to them, as both the fitness and the behavior depend on the opposing solutions. Recently, Generational Adversarial MAP-Elites (GAME) has been proposed to coevolve both sides of an adversarial problem by alternating the execution of a multi-task QD algorithm against previous elites, called tasks. The original algorithm selects new tasks based on a behavioral criterion, which may lead to undesired dynamics due to inter-side dependencies. In addition, comparing sets of solutions cannot be done directly using classical QD measures due to side dependencies. In this paper, we (1) use an inter-variants tournament to compare the sets of solutions, ensuring a fair comparison, with 6 measures of quality and diversity, and (2) propose two tournament-informed task selection methods to promote higher quality and diversity at each generation. We evaluate the variants across three adversarial problems: Pong, a Cat-and-mouse game, and a Pursuers-and-evaders game. We show that the tournament-informed task selection method leads to higher adversarial quality and diversity. We hope that this work will help further advance adversarial quality diversity.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) unlock unprecedented multimodal and multitask intelligence, yet their cloud-centric deployment precludes real-time responsiveness and compromises user privacy. Meanwhile, monolithic execution at the edge remains infeasible under stringent resource limits and uncertain network dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a microservice-based FM inference framework that exploits the intrinsic functional asymmetry between heavyweight core services and agile light services. Our two-tier deployment strategy ensures robust Quality of Service (QoS) under resource contention. Specifically, core services are placed statically via a long-term network-aware integer program with sparsity constraints to form a fault-tolerant backbone. On the other hand, light services are orchestrated dynamically by a low-complexity online controller that integrates effective capacity theory with Lyapunov optimization, providing probabilistic latency guarantees under real-time workload fluctuations. Simulations demonstrate that our framework achieves over 84% average on-time task completion with moderate deployment costs and maintains strong robustness as the system load scales.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19563v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Adaptive Parallel Execution for Efficient Code Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19568</link><description>arXiv:2601.19568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code localization constitutes a key bottleneck in automated software development pipelines. While concurrent tool execution can enhance discovery speed, current agents demonstrate a 34.9\% redundant invocation rate, which negates parallelism benefits. We propose \textbf{FuseSearch}, reformulating parallel code localization as a \textbf{joint quality-efficiency optimization} task. Through defining \textbf{tool efficiency} -- the ratio of unique information gain to invocation count -- we utilize a two-phase SFT and RL training approach for learning adaptive parallel strategies. Different from fixed-breadth approaches, FuseSearch dynamically modulates search breadth according to task context, evolving from exploration phases to refinement stages. Evaluated on SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves SOTA-level performance (84.7\% file-level and 56.4\% function-level $F_1$ scores) with 93.6\% speedup, utilizing 67.7\% fewer turns and 68.9\% fewer tokens. Results indicate that efficiency-aware training naturally improves quality through eliminating noisy redundant signals, enabling high-performance cost-effective localization agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19568v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How to Serve Your Sandwich?

Abstract: We study the feasibility, profitability, and prevalence of sandwich attacks on Ethereum rollups with private mempools. First, we extend a formal model of optimal front- and back-run sizing, relating attack profitability to victim trade volume, liquidity depth, and slippage bounds. We complement it with an execution-feasibility model that quantifies co-inclusion constraints under private mempools. Second, we examine execution constraints in the absence of builder markets: without guaranteed atomic inclusion, attackers must rely on sequencer ordering, redundant submissions, and priority fee placement, which renders sandwiching probabilistic rather than deterministic. Third, using transaction-level data from major rollups, we show that naive heuristics overstate sandwich activity. We find that the majority of flagged patterns are false positives and that the median net return for these attacks is negative. Our results suggest that sandwiching, while endemic and profitable on Ethereum L1, is rare, unprofitable, and largely absent in rollups with private mempools. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions, refine measurement of MEV in L2s, and inform the design of sequencing policies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19570v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MaDiS: Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models for Sign Language Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19577</link><description>arXiv:2601.19577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG) aims to translate written texts into expressive sign motions, bridging communication barriers for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities. Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%. Code and models will be released on our project page.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19577v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Yunque DeepResearch Technical Report</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19578</link><description>arXiv:2601.19578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep research has emerged as a transformative capability for autonomous agents, empowering Large Language Models to navigate complex, open-ended tasks.

Abstract: Interactive recommender systems can dynamically adapt to user feedback, but often suffer from content homogeneity and filter bubble effects due to overfitting short-term user preferences. While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19588v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Localized Latent Editing for Dose-Response Modeling in Botulinum Toxin Injection Planning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19593</link><description>arXiv:2601.19593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections are the gold standard for managing facial asymmetry and aesthetic rejuvenation, yet determining the optimal dosage remains largely intuitive, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. We propose a localized latent editing framework that simulates Botulinum Toxin injection effects for injection planning through dose-response modeling. Our key contribution is a Region-Specific Latent Axis Discovery method that learns localized muscle relaxation trajectories in StyleGAN2's latent space, enabling precise control over specific facial regions without global side effects. By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients. On a hold-out test set, our framework demonstrates moderate-to-strong structural correlations for geometric asymmetry metrics, confirming that the generative model correctly captures the direction of morphological changes. While biological variability limits absolute precision, we introduce a hybrid "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow where clinicians interactively refine simulations, bridging the gap between pathological reconstruction and cosmetic planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19593v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Intersectional Fairness via Mixed-Integer Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19595</link><description>arXiv:2601.19595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence in high-risk domains, such as finance and healthcare, necessitates models that are both fair and transparent. While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19595v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Geometric Mechanics of Contrastive Representation Learning: Alignment Potentials, Entropic Dispersion, and Cross-Modal Divergence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19597</link><description>arXiv:2601.19597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While InfoNCE powers modern contrastive learning, its geometric mechanisms remain under-characterized beyond the canonical alignment--uniformity decomposition. We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying "uniformity" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19597v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decompose-and-Formalise: Recursively Verifiable Natural Language Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19605</link><description>arXiv:2601.19605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that integrating large language models (LLMs) with theorem provers (TPs) in neuro-symbolic pipelines helps with entailment verification and proof-guided refinement of explanations for natural language inference (NLI). However, scaling such refinement to naturalistic NLI remains difficult: long, syntactically rich inputs and deep multi-step arguments amplify autoformalisation errors, where a single local mismatch can invalidate the proof. Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation. Moreover, to improve faithfulness of autoformalisation, we introduce $\theta$-substitution in an event-based logical form to enforce consistent argument-role bindings. Across a range of reasoning tasks using five LLM backbones, our method achieves the highest explanation verification rates, improving over the state-of-the-art by 26.2%, 21.7%, 21.6% and 48.9%, while reducing refinement iterations and runtime and preserving strong NLI accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19605v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GMS-CAVP: Improving Audio-Video Correspondence with Multi-Scale Contrastive and Generative Pretraining</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19606</link><description>arXiv:2601.19606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in video-audio (V-A) understanding and generation have increasingly relied on joint V-A embeddings, which serve as the foundation for tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and generation. While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19606v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ComAgent: Multi-LLM based Agentic AI Empowered Intelligent Wireless Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19607</link><description>arXiv:2601.19607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging 6G networks rely on complex cross-layer optimization, yet manually translating high-level intents into mathematical formulations remains a bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, monolithic approaches often lack sufficient domain grounding, constraint awareness, and verification capabilities. To address this, we present ComAgent, a multi-LLM agentic AI framework. ComAgent employs a closed-loop Perception-Planning-Action-Reflection cycle, coordinating specialized agents for literature search, coding, and scoring to autonomously generate solver-ready formulations and reproducible simulations. By iteratively decomposing problems and self-correcting errors, the framework effectively bridges the gap between user intent and execution. Evaluations demonstrate that ComAgent achieves expert-comparable performance in complex beamforming optimization and outperforms monolithic LLMs across diverse wireless tasks, highlighting its potential for automating design in emerging wireless networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19607v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explicit Multi-head Attention for Inter-head Interaction in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19611</link><description>arXiv:2601.19611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19611v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Safe Exploration via Policy Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19612</link><description>arXiv:2601.19612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19612v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Up to 36x Speedup: Mask-based Parallel Inference Paradigm for Key Information Extraction in MLLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19613</link><description>arXiv:2601.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) from visually-rich documents (VrDs) is a critical task, for which recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong potential. However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using "[mask]" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models. By substantially improving efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, PIP paves the way for scalable and practical real-world KIE solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19613v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improved Initialization for Port-Hamiltonian Neural Network Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19617</link><description>arXiv:2601.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Port-Hamiltonian neural networks have shown promising results in the identification of nonlinear dynamics of complex systems, as their combination of physical principles with data-driven learning allows for accurate modelling. However, due to the non-convex optimization problem inherent in learning the correct network parameters, the training procedure is prone to converging to local minima, potentially leading to poor performance. In order to avoid this issue, this paper proposes an improved initialization for port-Hamiltonian neural networks. The core idea is to first estimate a linear port-Hamiltonian system to be used as an initialization for the network, after which the neural network adapts to the system nonlinearities, reducing the training times and improving convergence. The effectiveness of this method is tested on a chained mass-spring-damper setup for varying noise levels and compared to the original approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19617v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The role of self-supervised pretraining in differentially private medical image analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19618</link><description>arXiv:2601.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides formal protection for sensitive data but typically incurs substantial losses in diagnostic performance. Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints. The results establish initialization strategy as a central determinant of utility, fairness, and generalization in differentially private medical imaging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19618v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] R^3: Replay, Reflection, and Ranking Rewards for LLM Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19620</link><description>arXiv:2601.19620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) aim to solve diverse and complex problems through structured reasoning. Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \emph{\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \emph{cross-context \underline{\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \emph{in-context self-\underline{\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \emph{structural entropy \underline{\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models. Code and model will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19620v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Algorithmic Prompt-Augmentation for Efficient LLM-Based Heuristic Design for A* Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19622</link><description>arXiv:2601.19622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19622v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tracking Drift: Variation-Aware Entropy Scheduling for Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19624</link><description>arXiv:2601.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning often faces environment drift, but most existing methods rely on static entropy coefficients/target entropy, causing over-exploration during stable periods and under-exploration after drift (thus slow recovery), and leaving unanswered the principled question of how exploration intensity should scale with drift magnitude. We prove that entropy scheduling under non-stationarity can be reduced to a one-dimensional, round-by-round trade-off, faster tracking of the optimal solution after drift vs. avoiding gratuitous randomness when the environment is stable, so exploration strength can be driven by measurable online drift signals. Building on this, we propose AES (Adaptive Entropy Scheduling), which adaptively adjusts the entropy coefficient/temperature online using observable drift proxies during training, requiring almost no structural changes and incurring minimal overhead. Across 4 algorithm variants, 12 tasks, and 4 drift modes, AES significantly reduces the fraction of performance degradation caused by drift and accelerates recovery after abrupt changes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19624v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Competence Crisis: A Design Fiction on AI-Assisted Research in Software Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19628</link><description>arXiv:2601.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rising publication pressure and the routine use of generative AI tools are reshaping how software engineering research is produced, assessed, and taught. While these developments promise efficiency, they also raise concerns about skill degradation, responsibility, and trust in scholarly outputs. This vision paper employs Design Fiction as a methodological lens to examine how such concerns might materialise if current practices persist. Drawing on themes reported in a recent community survey, we construct a speculative artifact situated in a near future research setting. The fiction is used as an analytical device rather than a forecast, enabling reflection on how automated assistance might impede domain knowledge competence, verification, and mentoring practices. By presenting an intentionally unsettling scenario, the paper invites discussion on how the software engineering research community in the future will define proficiency, allocate responsibility, and support learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19628v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AC^2-VLA: Action-Context-Aware Adaptive Computation in Vision-Language-Action Models for Efficient Robotic Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19634</link><description>arXiv:2601.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance in robotic manipulation, yet their closed-loop deployment is hindered by the high latency and compute cost of repeatedly running large vision-language backbones at every timestep. We observe that VLA inference exhibits structured redundancies across temporal, spatial, and depth dimensions, and that most existing efficiency methods ignore action context, despite its central role in embodied tasks. To address this gap, we propose Action-Context-aware Adaptive Computation for VLA models (AC^2-VLA), a unified framework that conditions computation on current visual observations, language instructions, and previous action states. Based on this action-centric context, AC^2-VLA adaptively performs cognition reuse across timesteps, token pruning, and selective execution of model components within a unified mechanism. To train the adaptive policy, we introduce an action-guided self-distillation scheme that preserves the behavior of the dense VLA policy while enabling structured sparsification that transfers across tasks and settings. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that AC^2-VLA achieves up to a 1.79\times speedup while reducing FLOPs to 29.4% of the dense baseline, with comparable task success.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19634v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who Said CVE?

Bots account for around 69.1% of all mentions, usually adding few identifiers in pull request descriptions, while human and agent mentions are rarer but span more locations.

Abstract: Reviewer assignment is increasingly critical yet challenging in the LLM era, where rapid topic shifts render many pre-2023 benchmarks outdated and where proxy signals poorly reflect true reviewer familiarity.

Abstract: Low-altitude vision systems are becoming a critical infrastructure for smart city governance. However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves performance while avoiding the need of fine-tuning for any task-specific individual components. We believe our work offers a new perspective and foundation for future studies on management-aware low-altitude vision-language systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19640v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Bisimulation-Invariance-Based Approach to the Separation of Polynomial Complexity Classes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19641</link><description>arXiv:2601.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility to separate the bisimulation-invariant fragment of P from that of NP, resp. PSPACE. We build on Otto's Theorem stating that the bisimulation-invariant queries in P are exactly those that are definable in the polyadic mu-calculus, and use a known construction from model checking in order to reduce definability in the polyadic $\mu$-calculus to definability in the ordinary modal mu-calculus within the class of so-called power graphs, giving rise to a notion of relative regularity. We give examples of certain bisimulation-invariant queries in NP, resp. PSPACE, and characterise their membership in P in terms of relative non-regularity of particular families of tree languages. A proof of non-regularity for all members of one such family would separate the corresponding class from P, but the combinatorial complexity involved in it is high. On the plus side, the step into the bisimulation-invariant world alleviates the order-problem that other approaches in descriptive complexity suffer from when studying the relationship between P and classes above.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19641v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robustness of Constraint Automata for Description Logics with Concrete Domains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19644</link><description>arXiv:2601.19644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decidability or complexity issues about the consistency problem for description logics with concrete domains have already been analysed with tableaux-based or type elimination methods. Concrete domains in ontologies are essential to consider concrete objects and predefined relations. In this work, we expose an automata-based approach leading to the optimal upper bound EXPTIME, that is designed by enriching the transitions with symbolic constraints. We show that the nonemptiness problem for such automata belongs to EXPTIME if the concrete domains satisfy a few simple properties. Then, we provide a reduction from the consistency problem for ontologies, yielding EXPTIME-membership.Thanks to the expressivity of constraint automata, the results are extended to additional ingredients such as inverse roles, functional role names and constraint assertions, while maintaining EXPTIME-membership, which illustrates the robustness of the approach</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19644v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convex Hull 3D Filtering with GPU Ray Tracing and Tensor Cores</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19647</link><description>arXiv:2601.19647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, applications such as real-time simulations, autonomous systems, and video games increasingly demand the processing of complex geometric models under stringent time constraints. Traditional geometric algorithms, including the convex hull, are subject to these challenges. A common approach to improve performance is scaling computational resources, which often results in higher energy consumption. Given the growing global concern regarding sustainable use of energy, this becomes a critical limitation. This work presents a 3D preprocessing filter for the convex hull algorithm using ray tracing and tensor core technologies. The filter builds a delimiter polyhedron based on Manhattan distances that discards points from the original set. The filter is evaluated on two point distributions: uniform and sphere. Experimental results show that the proposed filter, combined with convex hull construction, accelerates the computation of the 3D convex hull by up to $200 \times$ with respect to a CPU parallel implementation. This research demonstrates that geometric algorithms can be accelerated through massive parallelism while maintaining efficient energy utilization. Beyond execution time and speedup evaluation, we also analyze GPU energy consumption, showing that the proposed preprocessing filter not only reduces the computational workload but also achieves performance gains with controlled energy usage. These results highlight the dual benefit of the method in terms of both speed and energy efficiency, reinforcing its applicability in modern high-performance scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19647v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Single-Winner Voting on Matchings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19653</link><description>arXiv:2601.19653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a single-winner perspective on voting on matchings, in which voters have preferences over possible matchings in a graph, and the goal is to select a single collectively desirable matching. Unlike in classical matching problems, voters in our model are not part of the graph; instead, they have preferences over the entire matching. In the resulting election, the candidate space consists of all feasible matchings, whose exponential size renders standard algorithms for identifying socially desirable outcomes computationally infeasible. We study whether the computational tractability of finding such outcomes can be regained by exploiting the matching structure of the candidate space. Specifically, we provide a complete complexity landscape for questions concerning the maximization of social welfare, the construction and verification of Pareto optimal outcomes, and the existence and verification of Condorcet winners under one affine and two approval-based utility models. Our results consist of a mix of algorithmic and intractability results, revealing sharp boundaries between tractable and intractable cases, with complexity jumps arising from subtle changes in the utility model or solution concept.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19653v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One Token Is Enough: Improving Diffusion Language Models with a Sink Token</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19657</link><description>arXiv:2601.19657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive approaches, enabling parallel text generation with competitive performance. Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19657v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KeepLoRA: Continual Learning with Residual Gradient Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19659</link><description>arXiv:2601.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning for pre-trained vision-language models requires balancing three competing objectives: retaining pre-trained knowledge, preserving knowledge from a sequence of learned tasks, and maintaining the plasticity to acquire new knowledge. This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features. Our theoretical and empirical analyses confirm that KeepLoRA balances the three objectives and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/MaolinLuo/KeepLoRA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19659v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Frequency Shaping Control for Oscillation Damping in Weakly-Connected Power Network: A Root Locus Method</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19665</link><description>arXiv:2601.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency control following a contingency event is of vital concern in power system operations. Leveraging inverter-based resources, it is not hard to shape the center of inertia (COI) frequency nicely. However, under weak grid conditions, it becomes insufficient to solely shape the COI frequency since this aggregate signal fails to reveal the inter-area oscillations. In this manuscript, we advocate for foolproof fine-tuning rules for \emph{frequency shaping control} (FS) based on a systematic analysis of damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations to simultaneously meet specified metrics for frequency security and oscillatory stability. To this end, building on a modal decomposition, we simplify the oscillation damping problem into a pole-placement task for a set of scalar subsystems, which can be efficiently solved by only investigating the root locus of a scalar subsystem associated with the main mode, while FS inherently guarantees a Nadir-less COI frequency response. Through our proposed root-locus-based oscillatory stability analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum damping ratio and decay rate among inter-area oscillations in terms of networked system and control parameters under FS. Moreover, we propose useful tuning guidelines for FS which need only simple calculations or visualized tuning to not only shape the COI frequency into a first-order response that converges to a steady-state value within the allowed range but also ensure a satisfactory damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations following disturbances. As for the common virtual inertia control (VI), although similar oscillatory stability analysis becomes intractable, one can still glean some insights via the root locus method. Numerical simulations validate the proposed tuning for FS as well as the superiority of FS over VI in exponential convergence rate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19665v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SynCABEL: Synthetic Contextualized Augmentation for Biomedical Entity Linking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19667</link><description>arXiv:2601.19667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SynCABEL (Synthetic Contextualized Augmentation for Biomedical Entity Linking), a framework that addresses a central bottleneck in supervised biomedical entity linking (BEL): the scarcity of expert-annotated training data. SynCABEL leverages large language models to generate context-rich synthetic training examples for all candidate concepts in a target knowledge base, providing broad supervision without manual annotation. We demonstrate that SynCABEL, when combined with decoder-only models and guided inference establish new state-of-the-art results across three widely used multilingual benchmarks: MedMentions for English, QUAERO for French, and SPACCC for Spanish. Evaluating data efficiency, we show that SynCABEL reaches the performance of full human supervision using up to 60% less annotated data, substantially reducing reliance on labor-intensive and costly expert labeling. Finally, acknowledging that standard evaluation based on exact code matching often underestimates clinically valid predictions due to ontology redundancy, we introduce an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. This analysis reveals that SynCABEL significantly improves the rate of clinically valid predictions. Our synthetic datasets, models, and code are released to support reproducibility and future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19667v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Grasynda: Graph-based Synthetic Time Series Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19668</link><description>arXiv:2601.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial tool in time series forecasting, especially for deep learning architectures that require a large training sample size to generalize effectively. However, extensive datasets are not always available in real-world scenarios. Although many data augmentation methods exist, their limitations include the use of transformations that do not adequately preserve data properties. This paper introduces Grasynda, a novel graph-based approach for synthetic time series generation that: (1) converts univariate time series into a network structure using a graph representation, where each state is a node and each transition is represented as a directed edge; and (2) encodes their temporal dynamics in a transition probability matrix. We performed an extensive evaluation of Grasynda as a data augmentation method for time series forecasting. We use three neural network variations on six benchmark datasets. The results indicate that Grasynda consistently outperforms other time series data augmentation methods, including ones used in state-of-the-art time series foundation models. The method and all experiments are publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19668v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProToken: Token-Level Attribution for Federated Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19672</link><description>arXiv:2601.19672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19672v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Benchmark for Audio Reasoning Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19673</link><description>arXiv:2601.19673v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19674v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LoPRo: Enhancing Low-Rank Quantization via Permuted Block-Wise Rotation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19675</link><description>arXiv:2601.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\%$\uparrow$. Moreover, compared to other low-rank quantization methods, LoPRo achieves superior accuracy with a significantly lower rank, while maintaining high inference efficiency and minimal additional latency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19675v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Green's Function-Based Enclosure Framework for Poisson's Equation and Generalized Sub- and Super-Solutions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19682</link><description>arXiv:2601.19682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enclosing solutions of Poisson's equation based on generalized sub- and super-solutions constructed using fundamental solutions. The conventional definition of sub- and super-solutions based on variational inequalities often fails for natural function classes such as piecewise linear functions and encounters theoretical difficulties in non-convex polygonal domains, where H^2 regularity is lost because of corner singularities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of ``Green-representable solutions'' utilizing test functions constructed from fundamental solutions. This framework enables a new formulation of sub- and super-solutions that permits rigorous pointwise evaluation. For one-dimensional problems, we derive explicit constructions of the test functions. For two-dimensional polygonal domains, we employ the Method of Fundamental Solutions to generate test functions. The approach is validated through numerical experiments in both settings, including non-convex polygons. The results demonstrate that the proposed method yields strict and accurate pointwise enclosures of the true solution, even for problems with discontinuous source terms or geometric singularities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19682v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SharpNet: Enhancing MLPs to Represent Functions with Controlled Non-differentiability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19683</link><description>arXiv:2601.19683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are a standard tool for learning and function approximation, but they inherently yield outputs that are globally smooth. As a result, they struggle to represent functions that are continuous yet deliberately non-differentiable (i.e., with prescribed $C^0$ sharp features) without relying on ad hoc post-processing. We present SharpNet, a modified MLP architecture capable of encoding functions with user-defined sharp features by enriching the network with an auxiliary feature function, which is defined as the solution to a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions. It is evaluated via an efficient local integral that is fully differentiable with respect to the feature locations, enabling our method to jointly optimize both the feature locations and the MLP parameters to recover the target functions/models. The $C^0$-continuity of SharpNet is precisely controllable, ensuring $C^0$-continuity at the feature locations and smoothness elsewhere. We validate SharpNet on 2D problems and 3D CAD model reconstruction, and compare it against several state-of-the-art baselines. In both types of tasks, SharpNet accurately recovers sharp edges and corners while maintaining smooth behavior away from those features, whereas existing methods tend to smooth out gradient discontinuities. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations highlight the benefits of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19683v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-Assisted Authentication and Fraud Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19684</link><description>arXiv:2601.19684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User authentication and fraud detection face growing challenges as digital systems expand and adversaries adopt increasingly sophisticated tactics. Traditional knowledge-based authentication remains rigid, requiring exact word-for-word string matches that fail to accommodate natural human memory and linguistic variation. Meanwhile, fraud-detection pipelines struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving scam behaviors, leading to high false-positive rates and frequent retraining cycles required. This work introduces two complementary LLM-enabled solutions, namely, an LLM-assisted authentication mechanism that evaluates semantic correctness rather than exact wording, supported by document segmentation and a hybrid scoring method combining LLM judgement with cosine-similarity metrics and a RAG-based fraud-detection pipeline that grounds LLM reasoning in curated evidence to reduce hallucinations and adapt to emerging scam patterns without model retraining. Experiments show that the authentication system accepts 99.5% of legitimate non-exact answers while maintaining a 0,1% false-acceptance rate, and that the RAG-enhanced fraud detection reduces false positives from 17.2% to 35%. Together, these findings demonstrate that LLMs can significantly improve both usability and robustness in security workflows, offering a more adaptive , explainable, and human-aligned approach to authentication and fraud detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19684v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Video-KTR: Reinforcing Video Reasoning via Key Token Attribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19686</link><description>arXiv:2601.19686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong potential for enhancing reasoning in multimodal large language models, yet existing video reasoning methods often rely on coarse sequence-level rewards or single-factor token selection, neglecting fine-grained links among visual inputs, temporal dynamics, and linguistic outputs, limiting both accuracy and interpretability. We propose Video-KTR, a modality-aware policy shaping framework that performs selective, token-level RL by combining three attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens identified via counterfactual masking to reveal perceptual dependence; (2) temporal-aware tokens detected through frame shuffling to expose temporal sensitivity; and (3) high-entropy tokens signaling predictive uncertainty. By reinforcing only these key tokens, Video-KTR focuses learning on semantically informative, modality-sensitive content while filtering out low-value tokens. Across five challenging benchmarks, Video-KTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, achieving 42.7\% on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) with consistent gains on both reasoning and general video understanding tasks. Ablation studies verify the complementary roles of the attribution signals and the robustness of targeted token-level updates. Overall, Video-KTR improves accuracy and interpretability, offering a simple, drop-in extension to RL for complex video reasoning.

Abstract: Generative AI plays an increasing role during software engineering activities to make them, e.g., more efficient or provide better quality. However, it is often unclear how much benefit LLMs really provide. We concentrate on software architects and investigated how an LLM-supported evaluation of architecture documents can support software architects to improve such artefacts. In the context of a research project where a digital marketplace is developed and digital solutions should be analyzed, we used different LLMs to analyze the quality of architecture documents and compared the results with evaluations from software architects. We found out that the quality of the artifact has a strong influence on the quality of the LLM, i.e., the better the quality of the architecture document was, the more consistent were the LLM-based evaluation and the human expert evaluation. While using LLMs in this architecture task is promising, our results showed inconsistencies that need further analyses before generalizing them.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Supervised Weight Templates for Scalable Vision Model Initialization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19694</link><description>arXiv:2601.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of modern model parameters underscore the importance of pre-trained models. However, deployment often demands architectures of varying sizes, exposing limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose SWEET, a self-supervised framework that performs constraint-based pre-training to enable scalable initialization in vision tasks. Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization. Extensive experiments on \textsc{classification}, \textsc{detection}, \textsc{segmentation} and \textsc{generation} tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SWEET for initializing variable-sized vision models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19694v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AlignCoder: Aligning Retrieval with Target Intent for Repository-Level Code Completion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19697</link><description>arXiv:2601.19697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repository-level code completion remains a challenging task for existing code large language models (code LLMs) due to their limited understanding of repository-specific context and domain knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches have shown promise by retrieving relevant code snippets as cross-file context, they suffer from two fundamental problems: misalignment between the query and the target code in the retrieval process, and the inability of existing retrieval methods to effectively utilize the inference information. To address these challenges, we propose AlignCoder, a repository-level code completion framework that introduces a query enhancement mechanism and a reinforcement learning based retriever training method. Our approach generates multiple candidate completions to construct an enhanced query that bridges the semantic gap between the initial query and the target code. Additionally, we employ reinforcement learning to train an AlignRetriever that learns to leverage inference information in the enhanced query for more accurate retrieval. We evaluate AlignCoder on two widely-used benchmarks (CrossCodeEval and RepoEval) across five backbone code LLMs, demonstrating an 18.1% improvement in EM score compared to baselines on the CrossCodeEval benchmark. The results show that our framework achieves superior performance and exhibits high generalizability across various code LLMs and programming languages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19697v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Invariant Trajectories for Multimodal Large Language Model Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19700</link><description>arXiv:2601.19700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations.

By guiding signals through a waveguide and emitting them via a movable pinching antenna, these systems enable dynamic control of signal propagation and spatial adaptability. However, their performance heavily depends on effective resource allocation-encompassing power, bandwidth, and antenna positioning-which becomes challenging under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and user localization uncertainty. Existing studies largely assume perfect CSI or ideal user positioning, while our prior work considered uniform localization errors, an oversimplified assumption. In this paper, we develop a robust resource allocation framework for multiuser downlink pinching antenna systems under Gaussian-distributed localization uncertainty, which more accurately models real-world positioning errors. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subject to probabilistic outage constraints, and an analytical power allocation strategy is derived under given antenna positions. On this basis, the heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to identify the antenna position that achieves the global EE configuration. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme greatly enhances both EE and system reliability compared with fixed-antenna benchmark, validating its effectiveness for practical high-frequency wireless deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19704v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robustness of Approval-Based Multiwinner Voting Rules</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19706</link><description>arXiv:2601.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how robust approval-based multiwinner voting rules are to small perturbations in the votes. In particular, we consider the extent to which a committee can change after we add/remove/swap one approval, and we consider the computational complexity of deciding how many such operations are necessary to change the set of winning committees. We also consider the counting variants of our problems, which can be interpreted as computing the probability that the result of an election changes after a given number of random perturbations of the given election.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19706v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Exploration for High-Dimensional Continuous Control via Value-Guided Flow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19707</link><description>arXiv:2601.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional systems in biological and robotic applications is challenging due to expansive state-action spaces, where effective exploration is critical. Commonly used exploration strategies in reinforcement learning are largely undirected with sharp degradation as action dimensionality grows. Many existing methods resort to dimensionality reduction, which constrains policy expressiveness and forfeits system flexibility. We introduce Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex), a scalable reinforcement learning method that conducts exploration directly in the native high-dimensional action space. During training, Qflex traverses actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients rather than isotropic noise. Our proposed method substantially outperforms representative online reinforcement learning baselines across diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks. Qflex also successfully controls a full-body human musculoskeletal model to perform agile, complex movements, demonstrating superior scalability and sample efficiency in very high-dimensional settings. Our results indicate that value-guided flows offer a principled and practical route to exploration at scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19707v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hyperbolic Additive Margin Softmax with Hierarchical Information for Speaker Verification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19709</link><description>arXiv:2601.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speaker embedding learning based on Euclidean space has achieved significant progress, but it is still insufficient in modeling hierarchical information within speaker features. Hyperbolic space, with its negative curvature geometric properties, can efficiently represent hierarchical information within a finite volume, making it more suitable for the feature distribution of speaker embeddings. In this paper, we propose Hyperbolic Softmax (H-Softmax) and Hyperbolic Additive Margin Softmax (HAM-Softmax) based on hyperbolic space. H-Softmax incorporates hierarchical information into speaker embeddings by projecting embeddings and speaker centers into hyperbolic space and computing hyperbolic distances. HAM-Softmax further enhances inter-class separability by introducing margin constraint on this basis. Experimental results show that H-Softmax and HAM-Softmax achieve average relative EER reductions of 27.84% and 14.23% compared with standard Softmax and AM-Softmax, respectively, demonstrating that the proposed methods effectively improve speaker verification performance and at the same time preserve the capability of hierarchical structure modeling.

Abstract: Generative recommendation provides a novel paradigm in which each item is represented by a discrete semantic ID (SID) learned from rich content. Most existing methods treat SIDs as predefined and train recommenders under static indexing. In practice, SIDs are typically optimized only for content reconstruction rather than recommendation accuracy. This leads to an objective mismatch: the system optimizes an indexing loss to learn the SID and a recommendation loss for interaction prediction, but because the tokenizer is trained independently, the recommendation loss cannot update it. A natural approach is to make semantic indexing differentiable so that recommendation gradients can directly influence SID learning, but this often causes codebook collapse, where only a few codes are used. We attribute this issue to early deterministic assignments that limit codebook exploration, resulting in imbalance and unstable optimization.
  In this paper, we propose DIGER (Differentiable Semantic ID for Generative Recommendation), a first step toward effective differentiable semantic IDs for generative recommendation. DIGER introduces Gumbel noise to explicitly encourage early-stage exploration over codes, mitigating codebook collapse and improving code utilization. To balance exploration and convergence, we further design two uncertainty decay strategies that gradually reduce the Gumbel noise, enabling a smooth transition from early exploration to exploitation of learned SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate consistent improvements from differentiable semantic IDs. These results confirm the effectiveness of aligning indexing and recommendation objectives through differentiable SIDs and highlight differentiable semantic indexing as a promising research direction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19711v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Aware Novel-View Acoustic Synthesis with Vision-Language Priors and 3D Acoustic Environment Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19712</link><description>arXiv:2601.19712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial audio is essential for immersive experiences, yet novel-view acoustic synthesis (NVAS) remains challenging due to complex physical phenomena such as reflection, diffraction, and material absorption. Existing methods based on single-view or panoramic inputs improve spatial fidelity but fail to capture global geometry and semantic cues such as object layout and material properties. To address this, we propose Phys-NVAS, the first physics-aware NVAS framework that integrates spatial geometry modeling with vision-language semantic priors. A global 3D acoustic environment is reconstructed from multi-view images and depth maps to estimate room size and shape, enhancing spatial awareness of sound propagation. Meanwhile, a vision-language model extracts physics-aware priors of objects, layouts, and materials, capturing absorption and reflection beyond geometry. An acoustic feature fusion adapter unifies these cues into a physics-aware representation for binaural generation. Experiments on RWAVS demonstrate that Phys-NVAS yields binaural audio with improved realism and physical consistency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19712v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Similar Are Two Elections?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19716</link><description>arXiv:2601.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study isomorphic distances between ordinal
  elections (with the same numbers of candidates and voters). The main
  feature of these distances is that they are invariant to renaming
  the candidates and voters, and two elections are at distance zero if
  and only if they are isomorphic. Specifically, we consider
  isomorphic extensions of distances between preference orders: Given
  such a distance d, we extend it to distance d-ID between
  elections by unifying candidate names and finding a matching between
  the votes, so that the sum of the d-distances between the matched
  votes is as small as possible.
  We show that testing isomorphism of two elections can be done in
  polynomial time so, in principle, such distances can be tractable.
  Yet, we show that two very natural isomorphic distances are
  NP-complete and hard to approximate. We attempt to rectify the
  situation by showing FPT algorithms for several natural
  parameterizations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19716v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiffStyle3D: Consistent 3D Gaussian Stylization via Attention Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19717</link><description>arXiv:2601.19717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D style transfer enables the creation of visually expressive 3D content, enriching the visual appearance of 3D scenes and objects. However, existing VGG- and CLIP-based methods struggle to model multi-view consistency within the model itself, while diffusion-based approaches can capture such consistency but rely on denoising directions, leading to unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle3D, a novel diffusion-based paradigm for 3DGS style transfer that directly optimizes in the latent space. Specifically, we introduce an Attention-Aware Loss that performs style transfer by aligning style features in the self-attention space, while preserving original content through content feature alignment. Inspired by the geometric invariance of 3D stylization, we propose a Geometry-Guided Multi-View Consistency method that integrates geometric information into self-attention to enable cross-view correspondence modeling. Based on geometric information, we additionally construct a geometry-aware mask to prevent redundant optimization in overlapping regions across views, which further improves multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments show that DiffStyle3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher stylization quality and visual realism.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19717v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Divisive Hierarchical Clustering from a Distributional Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19718</link><description>arXiv:2601.19718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover that current objective-based Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC) methods produce a dendrogram that does not have three desired properties i.e., no unwarranted splitting, group similar clusters into a same subset, ground-truth correspondence. This shortcoming has their root cause in using a set-oriented bisecting assessment criterion. We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19718v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Policy Exploitation in Online Reinforcement Learning with Instant Retrospect Action</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19720</link><description>arXiv:2601.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing value-based online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer from slow policy exploitation due to ineffective exploration and delayed policy updates. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL. Experimental results show that IRA can significantly improve the learning efficiency and final performance of online RL algorithms on eight MuJoCo continuous control tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19720v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Component-Level Lesioning of Language Models Reveals Clinically Aligned Aphasia Phenotypes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19723</link><description>arXiv:2601.19723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit human-like linguistic behaviors and internal representations that they could serve as computational simulators of language cognition. We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19723v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Takes Flight: Two-Stage Resilient Topology Optimization for UAV Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19724</link><description>arXiv:2601.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) communication networks must maintain reliable connectivity under rapid topology changes, fluctuating link quality, and time-critical data exchange. Existing topology control methods rely on global optimization to produce a single optimal topology or involve high computational complexity, which limits adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper presents a two-stage quantum-assisted framework for efficient and resilient topology control in dynamic UAV networks by exploiting quantum parallelism to generate a set of high-quality and structurally diverse candidate topologies. In the offline stage, we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and leverage quantum annealing (QA) to parallelly sample multiple high-quality and structurally distinct topologies, providing a rich solution space for adaptive decision-making. In the online stage, a lightweight classical selection mechanism rapidly identifies the most suitable topology based on real-time link stability and channel conditions, substantially reducing the computation delay. The simulation results show that, compared to a single static optimal topology, the proposed framework improves performance retention by 6.6% in a 30-second dynamic window. Moreover, relative to the classic method, QA achieves an additional 5.15% reduction in objective value and a 28.3% increase in solution diversity. These findings demonstrate the potential of QA to enable fast and robust topology control for next-generation UAV communication networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19724v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RvB: Automating AI System Hardening via Iterative Red-Blue Games</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19726</link><description>arXiv:2601.19726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dual offensive and defensive utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights a critical gap in AI security: the lack of unified frameworks for dynamic, iterative adversarial adaptation hardening. To bridge this gap, we propose the Red Team vs. Blue Team (RvB) framework, formulated as a training-free, sequential, imperfect-information game. In this process, the Red Team exposes vulnerabilities, driving the Blue Team to learning effective solutions without parameter updates. We validate our framework across two challenging domains: dynamic code hardening against CVEs and guardrail optimization against jailbreaks. Our empirical results show that this interaction compels the Blue Team to learn fundamental defensive principles, leading to robust remediations that are not merely overfitted to specific exploits. RvB achieves Defense Success Rates of 90\% and 45\% across the respective tasks while maintaining near 0\% False Positive Rates, significantly surpassing baselines. This work establishes the iterative adversarial interaction framework as a practical paradigm that automates the continuous hardening of AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19726v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stability and Generalization of Nonconvex Optimization with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19730</link><description>arXiv:2601.19730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical evidence indicates that stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed gradient noise is more appropriate to characterize the training of machine learning models than that with standard bounded gradient variance noise. Most existing works on this phenomenon focus on the convergence of optimization errors, while the analysis for generalization bounds under the heavy-tailed gradient noise remains limited. In this paper, we develop a general framework for establishing generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise. Specifically, we introduce a truncation argument to achieve the generalization error bound based on the algorithmic stability under the assumption of bounded $p$th centered moment with $p\in(1,2]$. Building on this framework, we further provide the stability and generalization analysis for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed noise, including clipped and normalized stochastic gradient descent, as well as their mini-batch and momentum variants.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19730v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Future of Software Engineering Research: The SIGSOFT Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19731</link><description>arXiv:2601.19731v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Fine tuning has been regarded as a de facto approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but the high training memory consumption inherited from LLMs makes this process inefficient. Among existing memory efficient approaches, activation-related optimization has proven particularly effective, as activations consistently dominate overall memory consumption. Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance. Furthermore, our interpretable token seeking process reveals the underlying reasons for its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for future research on token efficiency.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models, but their practical use often depends on training neural networks to approximate the score function. Training-free diffusion models provide an attractive alternative by exploiting analytically tractable score functions, and have recently enabled supervised learning of efficient end-to-end generative samplers. Despite their empirical success, the training-free diffusion models lack rigorous and numerically verifiable error estimates. In this work, we develop a comprehensive error analysis for a class of training-free diffusion models used to generate labeled data for supervised learning of generative samplers. By exploiting the availability of the exact score function for Gaussian mixture models, our analysis avoids propagating score-function approximation errors through the reverse-time diffusion process and recovers classical convergence rates for ODE discretization schemes, such as first-order convergence for the Euler method. Moreover, the resulting error bounds exhibit favorable dimension dependence, scaling as $O(d)$ in the $\ell_2$ norm and $O(\log d)$ in the $\ell_\infty$ norm. Importantly, the proposed error estimates are fully numerically verifiable with respect to both time-step size and dimensionality, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical analysis and observed numerical behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19740v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SCOPE: Smooth Convex Optimization for Planned Evolution of Deformable Linear Objects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19742</link><description>arXiv:2601.19742v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has recently emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed graph learning across multiple data owners. A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19745v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Veri-Sure: A Contract-Aware Multi-Agent Framework with Temporal Tracing and Formal Verification for Correct RTL Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19747</link><description>arXiv:2601.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design has emerged as a promising direction. However, silicon-grade correctness remains bottlenecked by: (i) limited test coverage and reliability of simulation-centric evaluation, (ii) regressions and repair hallucinations introduced by iterative debugging, and (iii) semantic drift as intent is reinterpreted across agent handoffs. In this work, we propose Veri-Sure, a multi-agent framework that establishes a design contract to align agents' intent and uses a patching mechanism guided by static dependency slicing to perform precise, localized repairs. By integrating a multi-branch verification pipeline that combines trace-driven temporal analysis with formal verification consisting of assertion-based checking and boolean equivalence proofs, Veri-Sure enables functional correctness beyond pure simulations. We also introduce VerilogEval-v2-EXT, extending the original benchmark with 53 more industrial-grade design tasks and stratified difficulty levels, and show that Veri-Sure achieves state-of-the-art verified-correct RTL code generation performance, surpassing standalone LLMs and prior agentic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Missing Modality Completion in Product Catalogues</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19750</link><description>arXiv:2601.19750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missing-modality information on e-commerce platforms, such as absent product images or textual descriptions, often arises from annotation errors or incomplete metadata, impairing both product presentation and downstream applications such as recommendation systems. Motivated by the multimodal generative capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this work investigates a fundamental yet underexplored question: can MLLMs generate missing modalities for products in e-commerce scenarios? We propose the Missing Modality Product Completion Benchmark (MMPCBench), which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark.
  We further evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families across nine real-world e-commerce categories, focusing on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks. Experimental results show that while MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel- or patch-level alignment. In addition, performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, and we observe no trivial correlation between model size and performance, in contrast to trends commonly reported in mainstream benchmarks. We also explore Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with this task. GRPO improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion. Overall, these findings expose the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation and represent an early step toward more effective missing-modality product completion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19750v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Design Patterns: A System-Theoretic Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19752</link><description>arXiv:2601.19752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning &amp; World Model, Perception &amp; Grounding, Action Execution, Learning &amp; Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive &amp; Decisional, Execution &amp; Interaction, and Adaptive &amp; Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19752v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WaterClear-GS: Optical-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Underwater Reconstruction and Restoration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19753</link><description>arXiv:2601.19753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater 3D reconstruction and appearance restoration are hindered by the complex optical properties of water, such as wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods struggle with slow rendering speeds and suboptimal color restoration, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) inherently lacks the capability to model complex volumetric scattering effects. To address these issues, we introduce WaterClear-GS, the first pure 3DGS-based framework that explicitly integrates underwater optical properties of local attenuation and scattering into Gaussian primitives, eliminating the need for an auxiliary medium network. Our method employs a dual-branch optimization strategy to ensure underwater photometric consistency while naturally recovering water-free appearances. This strategy is enhanced by depth-guided geometry regularization and perception-driven image loss, together with exposure constraints, spatially-adaptive regularization, and physically guided spectral regularization, which collectively enforce local 3D coherence and maintain natural visual perception. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that WaterClear-GS achieves outstanding performance on both novel view synthesis (NVS) and underwater image restoration (UIR) tasks, while maintaining real-time rendering. The code will be available at https://buaaxrzhang.github.io/WaterClear-GS/.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19753v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Provable Learning of Random Hierarchy Models and Hierarchical Shallow-to-Deep Chaining</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19756</link><description>arXiv:2601.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to deep networks' ability to exploit hierarchical structure in data, constructing increasingly complex features across layers. Yet despite substantial progress in deep learning theory, most optimization results sill focus on networks with only two or three layers, leaving the theoretical understanding of hierarchical learning in genuinely deep models limited. This leads to a natural question: can we prove that deep networks, trained by gradient-based methods, can efficiently exploit hierarchical structure?
  In this work, we consider Random Hierarchy Models -- a hierarchical context-free grammar introduced by arXiv:2307.02129 and conjectured to separate deep and shallow networks. We prove that, under mild conditions, a deep convolutional network can be efficiently trained to learn this function class. Our proof builds on a general observation: if intermediate layers can receive clean signal from the labels and the relevant features are weakly identifiable, then layerwise training each individual layer suffices to hierarchically learn the target function.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19756v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reimagining Social Robots as Recommender Systems: Foundations, Framework, and Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19761</link><description>arXiv:2601.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalization in social robots refers to the ability of the robot to meet the needs and/or preferences of an individual user. Existing approaches typically rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware responses based on user metadata and historical interactions or on adaptive methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) to learn from users' immediate reactions in real time. However, these approaches fall short of comprehensively capturing user preferences-including long-term, short-term, and fine-grained aspects-, and of using them to rank and select actions, proactively personalize interactions, and ensure ethically responsible adaptations. To address the limitations, we propose drawing on recommender systems (RSs), which specialize in modeling user preferences and providing personalized recommendations. To ensure the integration of RS techniques is well-grounded and seamless throughout the social robot pipeline, we (i) align the paradigms underlying social robots and RSs, (ii) identify key techniques that can enhance personalization in social robots, and (iii) design them as modular, plug-and-play components. This work not only establishes a framework for integrating RS techniques into social robots but also opens a pathway for deep collaboration between the RS and HRI communities, accelerating innovation in both fields.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19761v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Effect of Architecture During Continual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19766</link><description>arXiv:2601.19766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning is a challenge for models with static architecture, as they fail to adapt to when data distributions evolve across tasks. We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.
  To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19766v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Advanced Modeling of Interlanguage Speech Intelligibility Benefit with L1-L2 Multi-Task Learning Using Differentiable K-Means for Accent-Robust Discrete Token-Based ASR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19767</link><description>arXiv:2601.19767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building ASR systems robust to foreign-accented speech is an important challenge in today's globalized world. A prior study explored the way to enhance the performance of phonetic token-based ASR on accented speech by reproducing the phenomenon known as interlanguage speech intelligibility benefit (ISIB), where foreign-accented speech is more intelligible to listeners sharing the speaker's native language than to native listeners. ISIB was technically implemented by using the speaker's L1 to learn k-means cluster centroids in an SSL feature space to obtain phonetic tokens. In this study, we propose a more advanced modeling of ISIB. By employing differentiable k-means and optimizing the entire module for both L1 and L2 ASR, the proposed method outperformed the baselines, both when using only native speech and when additionally incorporating a limited amount of accented speech. Notably, in the latter scenario, our method achieved approximately a 20% relative improvement in recognition accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19767v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GAVEL: Towards rule-based safety through activation monitoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19768</link><description>arXiv:2601.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly paired with activation-based monitoring to detect and prevent harmful behaviors that may not be apparent at the surface-text level. However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19768v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PaW-ViT: A Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer for Robust Ear Verification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19771</link><description>arXiv:2601.19771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rectangular tokens common to vision transformer methods for visual recognition can strongly affect performance of these methods due to incorporation of information outside the objects to be recognized. This paper introduces PaW-ViT, Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer, a preprocessing approach rooted in anatomical knowledge that normalizes ear images to enhance the efficacy of ViT. By accurately aligning token boundaries to detected ear feature boundaries, PaW-ViT obtains greater robustness to shape, size, and pose variation. By aligning feature boundaries to natural ear curvature, it produces more consistent token representations for various morphologies. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of PaW-ViT on various ViT models (ViT-T, ViT-S, ViT-B, ViT-L) and yield reasonable alignment robustness to variation in shape, size, and pose. Our work aims to solve the disconnect between ear biometric morphological variation and transformer architecture positional sensitivity, presenting a possible avenue for authentication schemes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19771v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Strong Reasoning Isn't Enough: Evaluating Evidence Elicitation in Interactive Diagnosis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19773</link><description>arXiv:2601.19773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive medical consultation requires an agent to proactively elicit missing clinical evidence under uncertainty. Yet existing evaluations largely remain static or outcome-centric, neglecting the evidence-gathering process. In this work, we propose an interactive evaluation framework that explicitly models the consultation process using a simulated patient and a \rev{simulated reporter} grounded in atomic evidences. Based on this representation, we introduce Information Coverage Rate (ICR) to quantify how completely an agent uncovers necessary evidence during interaction. To support systematic study, we build EviMed, an evidence-based benchmark spanning diverse conditions from common complaints to rare diseases, and evaluate 10 models with varying reasoning abilities. We find that strong diagnostic reasoning does not guarantee effective information collection, and this insufficiency acts as a primary bottleneck limiting performance in interactive settings. To address this, we propose REFINE, a strategy that leverages diagnostic verification to guide the agent in proactively resolving uncertainties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms baselines across diverse datasets and facilitates effective model collaboration, enabling smaller agents to achieve superior performance under strong reasoning supervision.

Abstract: The software engineering research community faces a systemic crisis: peer review is failing under growing submissions, misaligned incentives, and reviewer fatigue. Community surveys reveal that researchers perceive the process as "broken." This position paper argues that these dysfunctions are mechanism design failures amenable to computational solutions. We propose modeling the research community as a stochastic multi-agent system and applying multi-agent reinforcement learning to design incentive-compatible protocols. We outline three interventions: a credit-based submission economy, MARL-optimized reviewer assignment, and hybrid verification of review consistency. We present threat models, equity considerations, and phased pilot metrics.

Abstract: 3D scene generation is a core technology for gaming, film/VFX, and VR/AR. Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19785v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Assessing Task-based Chatbots: Snapshot and Curated Datasets for Dialogflow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19787</link><description>arXiv:2601.19787v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) leverages inter-client collaboration to balance new knowledge acquisition and prior knowledge retention in non-stationary data. However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19788v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] To Grok Grokking: Provable Grokking in Ridge Regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19791</link><description>arXiv:2601.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study grokking, the onset of generalization long after overfitting, in a classical ridge regression setting. We prove end-to-end grokking results for learning over-parameterized linear regression models using gradient descent with weight decay. Specifically, we prove that the following stages occur: (i) the model overfits the training data early during training; (ii) poor generalization persists long after overfitting has manifested; and (iii) the generalization error eventually becomes arbitrarily small. Moreover, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that grokking can be amplified or eliminated in a principled manner through proper hyperparameter tuning. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous quantitative bounds on the generalization delay (which we refer to as the "grokking time") in terms of training hyperparameters. Lastly, going beyond the linear setting, we empirically demonstrate that our quantitative bounds also capture the behavior of grokking on non-linear neural networks. Our results suggest that grokking is not an inherent failure mode of deep learning, but rather a consequence of specific training conditions, and thus does not require fundamental changes to the model architecture or learning algorithm to avoid.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19791v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LVLMs and Humans Ground Differently in Referential Communication</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19792</link><description>arXiv:2601.19792v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Graph-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable complex cyclic workflows but suffer from inefficient static model allocation, where deploying strong models uniformly wastes computation on trivial sub-tasks. We propose CASTER (Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing), a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS. CASTER employs a Dual-Signal Router that combines semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty. During training, the router self-optimizes through a Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm, learning from its own routing failures via on-policy negative feedback. Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19793v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Component-Aware Pruning Framework for Neural Network Controllers via Gradient-Based Importance Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19794</link><description>arXiv:2601.19794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from monolithic to multi-component neural architectures in advanced neural network controllers poses substantial challenges due to the high computational complexity of the latter.

Abstract: Ear occlusions (arising from the presence of ear accessories such as earrings and earphones) can negatively impact performance in ear-based biometric recognition systems, especially in unconstrained imaging circumstances. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19795v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Youtu-VL: Unleashing Visual Potential via Unified Vision-Language Supervision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19798</link><description>arXiv:2601.19798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the significant advancements represented by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current architectures often exhibit limitations in retaining fine-grained visual information, leading to coarse-grained multimodal comprehension. We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19798v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-Shot Stance Detection in the Wild: Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19802</link><description>arXiv:2601.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current stance detection research typically relies on predicting stance based on given targets and text.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel task: zero-shot stance detection in the wild with Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation (DGTA), which aims to automatically identify multiple target-stance pairs from text without prior target knowledge. We construct a Chinese social media stance detection dataset and design multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. We explore both integrated and two-stage fine-tuning strategies for large language models (LLMs) and evaluate various baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance on this task: the two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B attains the highest comprehensive target recognition score of 66.99%, while the integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a stance detection F1 score of 79.26%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19802v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised Learning of Efficient Exploration: Pre-training Adaptive Policies via Self-Imposed Goals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19810</link><description>arXiv:2601.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19810v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learn and Verify: A Framework for Rigorous Verification of Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19818</link><description>arXiv:2601.19818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical solution of differential equations using neural networks has become a central topic in scientific computing, with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) emerging as a powerful paradigm for both forward and inverse problems. However, unlike classical numerical methods that offer established convergence guarantees, neural network-based approximations typically lack rigorous error bounds. Furthermore, the non-deterministic nature of their optimization makes it difficult to mathematically certify their accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a "Learn and Verify" framework that provides computable, mathematically rigorous error bounds for the solutions of differential equations. By combining a novel Doubly Smoothed Maximum (DSM) loss for training with interval arithmetic for verification, we compute rigorous a posteriori error bounds as machine-verifiable proofs. Numerical experiments on nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), including problems with time-varying coefficients and finite-time blow-up, demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully constructs rigorous enclosures of the true solutions, establishing a foundation for trustworthy scientific machine learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19818v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Query-Guided Spatial-Temporal-Frequency Interaction for Music Audio-Visual Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19821</link><description>arXiv:2601.19821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio--Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires jointly reasoning over audio, visual, and textual information in a given video to answer natural language questions. Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches. The code and pretrained models will be released after publication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19821v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Latent Space Framework for Modeling Transient Engine Emissions Using Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19822</link><description>arXiv:2601.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling and controlling vehicle exhaust emissions during transient events, such as rapid acceleration, is critical for meeting environmental regulations and optimizing powertrains. Conventional data-driven methods, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, improve upon phenomenological models but often struggle with the complex nonlinear dynamics of emission formation. These monolithic architectures are sensitive to dataset variability and typically require deep, computationally expensive structures to perform well, limiting their practical utility. This paper introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by modeling emission dynamics within a structured latent space. Leveraging a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), the proposed framework learns from a rich dataset that combines real-world Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) data with high-frequency hardware-in-the-loop measurements. The model abstracts away irrelevant noise, encoding only the key factors governing emission behavior into a compact, robust representation. This results in superior data efficiency and predictive accuracy across diverse transient regimes, significantly outperforming high-performing LSTM baselines in generalization. To ensure suitability for real-world deployment, the JEPA framework is structured to support pruning and post-training quantization. This strategy drastically reduces the computational footprint, minimizing inference time and memory demand with negligible accuracy loss. The result is a highly efficient model ideal for on-board implementation of advanced strategies, such as model predictive control or model-based reinforcement learning, in conventional and hybrid powertrains. These findings offer a clear pathway toward more robust emission control systems for next-generation vehicles.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Interpretable Recommendation Model for Psychometric Data, With an Application to Gerontological Primary Care</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19824</link><description>arXiv:2601.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19824v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Routing End User Queries to Enterprise Databases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19825</link><description>arXiv:2601.19825v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: As robots become increasingly integrated into daily life, understanding responses to robot mistreatment carries important ethical and design implications. This mixed-methods study (N = 201) examined how anthropomorphic levels and moral foundations shape reactions to robot abuse. Participants viewed videos depicting physical mistreatment of robots varying in humanness (Spider, Twofoot, Humanoid) and completed measures assessing moral foundations, anger, and social distance. Results revealed that anthropomorphism determines whether people extend moral consideration to robots, while moral foundations shape how they reason about such consideration. Qualitative analysis revealed distinct reasoning patterns: low-progressivism individuals employed character-based judgments, while high-progressivism individuals engaged in future-oriented moral deliberation. Findings offer implications for robot design and policy communication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19826v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Iterative RAG Beats Ideal Evidence: A Diagnostic Study in Scientific Multi-hop Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19827</link><description>arXiv:2601.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Galerkin-type time discretizations for parabolic and hyperbolic problems: stability and a priori error analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19828</link><description>arXiv:2601.19828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for the analysis of space-time methods based on Galerkin-type time discretizations for parabolic and hyperbolic problems. Crucially, the stability analysis relies on a suitable choice of test functions to establish the continuous dependence of the discrete solution on the data in $L^{\infty}(0, T; X)$ norms, which is then used to derive a priori error estimates. This approach closes the gap in the analysis of some methods in this class caused by the limitation of standard energy arguments, and is characterized by the absence of Gr\"onwall estimates, applicability to arbitrary approximation degrees, reduced regularity assumptions, and robustness with respect to the model parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19828v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Neural Scaling Laws</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19831</link><description>arXiv:2601.19831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws predict how language model performance improves with increased compute. While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE). Furthermore, NeuNeu generalizes zero-shot to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks. Our work suggests that predicting downstream scaling laws directly from data outperforms parametric alternatives.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19831v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Information-Theoretic Detection of Bimanual Interactions for Dual-Arm Robot Plan Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19832</link><description>arXiv:2601.19832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programming by demonstration is a strategy to simplify the robot programming process for non-experts via human demonstrations. However, its adoption for bimanual tasks is an underexplored problem due to the complexity of hand coordination, which also hinders data recording. This paper presents a novel one-shot method for processing a single RGB video of a bimanual task demonstration to generate an execution plan for a dual-arm robotic system. To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination. We validated the effectiveness of this framework through multiple subject video demonstrations, which we collected and made open-source, and exploiting data from an external, publicly available dataset. Comparisons with existing methods revealed significant improvements in generating a centralized execution plan for coordinating two-arm systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19832v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Multi-directional Meta-Learning Framework for Class-Generalizable Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19833</link><description>arXiv:2601.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19833v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Visual Generation Unlocks Human-Like Reasoning through Multimodal World Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19834</link><description>arXiv:2601.19834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19834v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Modified splitting methods for Gross-Pitaevskii systems modelling Bose-Einstein condensates: Time evolution and ground state computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19838</link><description>arXiv:2601.19838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The year 2025 marks the 100 and 30 years anniversaries of the discovery of Bose--Einstein condensation and its successful experimental realisation. Inspired by these important research achievements, a conceptually simple approach is proposed to facilitate reliable and efficient numerical simulations. The structure of the underlying systems of coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equations suggests the use of optimised high-order operator splitting methods for dynamical evolution and ground state computation. A second-order barrier, however, prevents the applicability of standard operator splitting methods for both, time evolution as well as imaginary time propagation. An innovative alternative approach accomplishes the design of novel modified operator splitting methods that remain stable under moderate smallness assumptions on the time increments. The core idea is to incorporate commutators of the defining differential and nonlinear multiplication operators, since this permits to fulfill the basic stability requirement of positive method coefficients. Further improvements with respect to convergence at the targeted precision arise from automatic adjustments of the time stepsizes by an inexpensive local error control. The presented numerical experiments confirm the favourable performance of a specific fourth-order modified operator splitting method. Amongst others, it is demonstrated that the excellent mass and energy conservation in long-term evolutions, intrinsic attributes of geometric numerical integrators for Hamiltonian systems, is maintained for a sensible variation of the time stepsizes. Moreover, the benefits of adaptive higher-order approximations in ground state computations are illustrated.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19838v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HARMONI: Multimodal Personalization of Multi-User Human-Robot Interactions with LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19839</link><description>arXiv:2601.19839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing human-robot interaction systems often lack mechanisms for sustained personalization and dynamic adaptation in multi-user environments, limiting their effectiveness in real-world deployments. We present HARMONI, a multimodal personalization framework that leverages large language models to enable socially assistive robots to manage long-term multi-user interactions. The framework integrates four key modules: (i) a perception module that identifies active speakers and extracts multimodal input; (ii) a world modeling module that maintains representations of the environment and short-term conversational context; (iii) a user modeling module that updates long-term speaker-specific profiles; and (iv) a generation module that produces contextually grounded and ethically informed responses. Through extensive evaluation and ablation studies on four datasets, as well as a real-world scenario-driven user-study in a nursing home environment, we demonstrate that HARMONI supports robust speaker identification, online memory updating, and ethically aligned personalization, outperforming baseline LLM-driven approaches in user modeling accuracy, personalization quality, and user satisfaction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19839v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graphical X Splatting (GraphiXS): A Graphical Model for 4D Gaussian Splatting under Uncertainty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19843</link><description>arXiv:2601.19843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new framework to systematically incorporate data uncertainty in Gaussian Splatting. Being the new paradigm of neural rendering, Gaussian Splatting has been investigated in many applications, with the main effort in extending its representation, improving its optimization process, and accelerating its speed. However, one orthogonal, much needed, but under-explored area is data uncertainty. In standard 4D Gaussian Splatting, data uncertainty can manifest as view sparsity, missing frames, camera asynchronization, etc. So far, there has been little research to holistically incorporating various types of data uncertainty under a single framework. To this end, we propose Graphical X Splatting, or GraphiXS, a new probabilistic framework that considers multiple types of data uncertainty, aiming for a fundamental augmentation of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting paradigm into a probabilistic setting. GraphiXS is general and can be instantiated with a range of primitives, e.g. Gaussians, Student's-t. Furthermore, GraphiXS can be used to `upgrade' existing methods to accommodate data uncertainty. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we demonstrate that GraphiXS can systematically model various uncertainties in data, outperform existing methods in many settings where data are missing or polluted in space and time, and therefore is a major generalization of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19843v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Identifying and Transferring Reasoning-Critical Neurons: Improving LLM Inference Reliability via Activation Steering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19847</link><description>arXiv:2601.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on challenging tasks often requires post-training or computationally expensive sampling strategies, limiting their practical efficiency. In this work, we first show that a small subset of neurons in LLMs exhibits strong predictive correlations with reasoning correctness. Based on this observation, we propose AdaRAS (Adaptive Reasoning Activation Steering), a lightweight test-time framework that improves reasoning reliability by selectively intervening on neuron activations. AdaRAS identifies Reasoning-Critical Neurons (RCNs) via a polarity-aware mean-difference criterion and adaptively steers their activations during inference, enhancing incorrect reasoning traces while avoiding degradation on already-correct cases. Experiments on 10 mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, including over 13% gains on AIME-24 and AIME-25. Moreover, AdaRAS exhibits strong transferability across datasets and scalability to stronger models, outperforming post-training methods without additional training or sampling cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19847v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HexFormer: Hyperbolic Vision Transformer with Exponential Map Aggregation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19849</link><description>arXiv:2601.19849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data across modalities such as images, text, and graphs often contains hierarchical and relational structures, which are challenging to model within Euclidean geometry. Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EgoHandICL: Egocentric 3D Hand Reconstruction with In-Context Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19850</link><description>arXiv:2601.19850v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Autonomy and independent navigation are vital to daily life but remain challenging for individuals with blindness. Robotic systems can enhance mobility and confidence by providing intelligent navigation assistance. However, fully autonomous systems may reduce users' sense of control, even when they wish to remain actively involved. Although collaboration between user and robot has been recognized as important, little is known about how perceptions of this relationship change with repeated use. We present a repeated exposure study with six blind participants who interacted with a navigation-assistive robot in a real-world museum. Participants completed tasks such as navigating crowds, approaching lines, and encountering obstacles. Findings show that participants refined their strategies over time, developing clearer preferences about when to rely on the robot versus act independently. This work provides insights into how strategies and preferences evolve with repeated interaction and offers design implications for robots that adapt to user needs over time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19851v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Estimating Trust in Human-Robot Collaboration through Behavioral Indicators and Explainability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19856</link><description>arXiv:2601.19856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry 5.0 focuses on human-centric collaboration between humans and robots, prioritizing safety, comfort, and trust. This study introduces a data-driven framework to assess trust using behavioral indicators. The framework employs a Preference-Based Optimization algorithm to generate trust-enhancing trajectories based on operator feedback. This feedback serves as ground truth for training machine learning models to predict trust levels from behavioral indicators. The framework was tested in a chemical industry scenario where a robot assisted a human operator in mixing chemicals. Machine learning models classified trust with over 80\% accuracy, with the Voting Classifier achieving 84.07\% accuracy and an AUC-ROC score of 0.90. These findings underscore the effectiveness of data-driven methods in assessing trust within human-robot collaboration, emphasizing the valuable role behavioral indicators play in predicting the dynamics of human trust.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19856v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Calibration without Ground Truth</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19862</link><description>arXiv:2601.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Villalobos et al. [2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19862v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reflective Translation: Improving Low-Resource Machine Translation via Structured Self-Reflection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19871</link><description>arXiv:2601.19871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19871v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RHSIA: Real-time Hemodynamics Surrogation for Non-idealized Intracranial Aneurysms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19876</link><description>arXiv:2601.19876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19876v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Energy-Preserving Domain of Dependence Stabilization for the Linear Wave Equation on Cut-Cell Meshes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19877</link><description>arXiv:2601.19877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an energy-preserving (either energy-conservative or energy-dissipative) domain of dependence stabilization method for the linear wave equation on cut-cell meshes. Our scheme is based on a standard discontinuous Galerkin discretization in space and an explicit (strong stability preserving) Runge Kutta method in time. Tailored stabilization terms allow for selecting the time step length based on the size of the background cells rather than the small cut cells by propagating information across small cut cells. The stabilization terms preserve the energy stability or energy conservation property of the underlying discontinuous Galerkin space discretization. Numerical results display the high accuracy and stability properties of our scheme.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19877v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SONIC: Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19884</link><description>arXiv:2601.19884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19884v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VGGT-SLAM 2.0: Real time Dense Feed-forward Scene Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19887</link><description>arXiv:2601.19887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VGGT-SLAM 2.0, a real time RGB feed-forward SLAM system which substantially improves upon VGGT-SLAM for incrementally aligning submaps created from VGGT. Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM. Code will be released upon publication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19887v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Post-LayerNorm Is Back: Stable, ExpressivE, and Deep</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19895</link><description>arXiv:2601.19895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19895v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Distillation Enables Continual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19897</link><description>arXiv:2601.19897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19897v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DuwatBench: Bridging Language and Visual Heritage through an Arabic Calligraphy Benchmark for Multimodal Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19898</link><description>arXiv:2601.19898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arabic calligraphy represents one of the richest visual traditions of the Arabic language, blending linguistic meaning with artistic form. Although multimodal models have advanced across languages, their ability to process Arabic script, especially in artistic and stylized calligraphic forms, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present DuwatBench, a benchmark of 1,272 curated samples containing about 1,475 unique words across six classical and modern calligraphic styles, each paired with sentence-level detection annotations. The dataset reflects real-world challenges in Arabic writing, such as complex stroke patterns, dense ligatures, and stylistic variations that often challenge standard text recognition systems. Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area. Our dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/DuwatBench) and evaluation suit (https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/DuwatBench) are publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19898v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluation of Oncotimia: An LLM based system for supporting tumour boards</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19899</link><description>arXiv:2601.19899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDTBs) play a central role in oncology decision-making but require manual processes and structuring large volumes of heterogeneous clinical information, resulting in a substantial documentation burden. In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19899v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Artificial Neural Network in Cosmic Landscape</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02800</link><description>arXiv:1707.02800v2 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Cellular automata (CA), originally developed as computational models of natural processes, have become a central subject in the study of complex systems and generative visual forms. Among them, the Ulam-Warburton Cellular Automaton (UWCA) exhibits recursive growth and fractal-like characteristics in its spatial evolution. However, exact self-similar fractal structures are typically observable only at specific generations and remain visually obscured in conventional binary renderings. This study introduces a Recursive Gradient Profile Function (RGPF) that assigns grayscale values to newly activated cells according to their generation index, enabling latent self-similar structures to emerge cumulatively in spatial visualizations. Through this gradient-based mapping, recursive geometric patterns become perceptible across scales, revealing fractal properties that are not apparent in standard representations. We further extend this approach to UWCA variants with alternative neighborhood configurations, demonstrating that these rules also produce distinct yet consistently fractal visual patterns when visualized using recursive gradient profile. Beyond computational analysis, the resulting generative forms resonate with optical and cultural phenomena such as infinity mirrors, video feedback, and mise en abyme in European art history, as well as fractal motifs found in religious architecture. These visual correspondences suggest a broader connection between complexity science, computational visualization, and cultural art and design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17361v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep g-Pricing for CSI 300 Index Options with Volatility Trajectories and Market Sentiment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18804</link><description>arXiv:2601.18804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Option pricing in real markets faces fundamental challenges. The Black--Scholes--Merton (BSM) model assumes constant volatility and uses a linear generator $g(t,x,y,z)=-ry$, while lacking explicit behavioral factors, resulting in systematic departures from observed dynamics. This paper extends the BSM model by learning a nonlinear generator within a deep Forward--Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE) framework. We propose a dual-network architecture where the value network $u_\theta$ learns option prices and the generator network $g_\phi$ characterizes the pricing mechanism, with the hedging strategy $Z_t=\sigma_t X_t \nabla_x u_\theta$ obtained via automatic differentiation. The framework adopts forward recursion from a learnable initial condition $Y_0=u_\theta(0,\cdot)$, naturally accommodating volatility trajectory and sentiment features. Empirical results on CSI 300 index options show that our method reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 32.2\% and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 35.3\% compared with BSM. Interpretability analysis indicates that architectural improvements are effective across all option types, while the information advantage is asymmetric between calls and puts. Specifically, call option improvements are primarily driven by sentiment features, whereas put options show more balanced contributions from volatility trajectory and sentiment features. This finding aligns with economic intuition regarding option pricing mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18804v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lightweight Quantum-Enhanced ResNet for Coronary Angiography Classification: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Feature Enhancement Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18814</link><description>arXiv:2601.18814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Coronary angiography (CAG) is the cornerstone imaging modality for evaluating coronary artery stenosis and guiding interventional decision-making. However, interpretation based on single-frame angiographic images remains highly operator-dependent, and conventional deep learning models still face challenges in modeling complex vascular morphology and fine-grained texture patterns.Methods: We propose a Lightweight Quantum-Enhanced ResNet (LQER) for binary classification of coronary angiography images. A pretrained ResNet18 is employed as a classical feature extractor, while a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is introduced at the high-level semantic feature space for quantum feature enhancement. The quantum module utilizes data re-uploading and entanglement structures, followed by residual fusion with classical features, enabling end-to-end hybrid optimization with a strictly controlled number of qubits.Results: On an independent test set, the proposed LQER outperformed the classical ResNet18 baseline in accuracy, AUC, and F1-score, achieving a test accuracy exceeding 90%. The results demonstrate that lightweight quantum feature enhancement improves discrimination of positive lesions, particularly under class-imbalanced conditions.Conclusion: This study validates a practical hybrid quantum--classical learning paradigm for coronary angiography analysis, providing a feasible pathway for deploying quantum machine learning in medical imaging applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18814v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LabelKAN -- Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Inter-Label Learning: Avian Community Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18818</link><description>arXiv:2601.18818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global biodiversity loss is accelerating, prompting international efforts such as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to direct resources toward halting species declines. A key challenge in achieving this goal is having access to robust methodologies to understand where species occur and how they relate to each other within broader ecological communities. Recent deep learning-based advances in joint species distribution modeling have shown improved predictive performance, but effectively incorporating community-level learning, taking into account species-species relationships in addition to species-environment relationships, remains an outstanding challenge. We introduce LabelKAN, a novel framework based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn inter-label connections from predictions of each label. When modeling avian species distributions, LabelKAN achieves substantial gains in predictive performance across the vast majority of species. In particular, our method demonstrates strong improvements for rare and difficult-to-predict species, which are often the most important when setting biodiversity targets under frameworks like GBF. These performance gains also translate to more confident predictions of the species spatial patterns as well as more confident predictions of community structure. We illustrate how the LabelKAN leads to qualitative and quantitative improvements with a focused application on the Great Blue Heron, an emblematic species in freshwater ecosystems that has experienced significant population declines across the United States in recent years. Using the LabelKAN framework, we are able to identify communities and species in New York that will be most sensitive to further declines in Great Blue Heron populations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18818v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lossy Image Compression -- A Frequent Sequence Mining perspective employing efficient Clustering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18821</link><description>arXiv:2601.18821v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Explainable boosting machines (EBMs) are popular "glass-box" models that learn a set of univariate functions using boosting trees. These achieve explainability through visualizations of each feature's effect. However, unlike linear model coefficients, uncertainty quantification for the learned univariate functions requires computationally intensive bootstrapping, making it hard to know which features truly matter. We provide an alternative using recent advances in statistical inference for gradient boosting, deriving methods for statistical inference as well as end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Using a moving average instead of a sum of trees (Boulevard regularization) allows the boosting process to converge to a feature-wise kernel ridge regression. This produces asymptotically normal predictions that achieve the minimax-optimal mean squared error for fitting Lipschitz GAMs with $p$ features at rate $O(pn^{-2/3})$, successfully avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We then construct prediction intervals for the response and confidence intervals for each learned univariate function with a runtime independent of the number of datapoints, enabling further explainability within EBMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18857v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multivariate Multicycle Codes for Complete Single-Shot Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18879</link><description>arXiv:2601.18879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce multivariate multicycle (MM) codes, a new family of quantum error correcting codes that unifies and generalizes bivariate bicycle codes, multivariate bicycle codes, abelian two-block group algebra codes, generalized bicycle codes, trivariate tricycle codes, and n-dimensional toric codes. MM codes are Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes defined from length-t chain complexes with $t \ge 4$. The chief advantage of these codes is that they possess metachecks and high confinement that permit complete single-shot decoding, while also having additional algebraic structure that might enable logical non-Clifford gates. We offer a framework that facilitates the construction of long-length chain complexes through the use of Koszul complex. In particular, obtaining explicit boundary maps (parity check and metacheck matrices) is particularly straightforward in our approach. This simple but very general parameterization of codes permitted us to efficiently perform a numerical search, where we identify several MM code candidates that demonstrate these capabilities at high rates and high code distances. Examples of new codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ include $[[96, 12, 8]]$, $[[96, 44, 4]]$ $[[144, 40, 4]]$, $[[216, 12, 12]]$, $[[360, 30, 6]]$, $[[384, 80, 4]]$, $[[486, 24, 12]]$, $[[486, 66, 9]]$ and $[[648, 60, 9]]$. Notably, our codes achieve confinement profiles that surpass all known single-shot decodable quantum CSS codes of practical blocksize.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18879v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Implicit Q-Learning and SARSA: Liberating Policy Control from Step-Size Calibration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18907</link><description>arXiv:2601.18907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Q-learning and SARSA are foundational reinforcement learning algorithms whose practical success depends critically on step-size calibration. Step-sizes that are too large can cause numerical instability, while step-sizes that are too small can lead to slow progress. We propose implicit variants of Q-learning and SARSA that reformulate their iterative updates as fixed-point equations. This yields an adaptive step-size adjustment that scales inversely with feature norms, providing automatic regularization without manual tuning. Our non-asymptotic analyses demonstrate that implicit methods maintain stability over significantly broader step-size ranges. Under favorable conditions, it permits arbitrarily large step-sizes while achieving comparable convergence rates. Empirical validation across benchmark environments spanning discrete and continuous state spaces shows that implicit Q-learning and SARSA exhibit substantially reduced sensitivity to step-size selection, achieving stable performance with step-sizes that would cause standard methods to fail.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18907v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tensorized Discontinuous Isogeometric Analysis Method for the 2-D Time-Independent Linearized Boltzmann Transport Equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18925</link><description>arXiv:2601.18925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the novel Tensorized Discontinuous Isogeometric Analysis (TDIGA) method applied to the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) time-independent 2-D linearized Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE) with higher-order scattering, discretized with discrete ordinates in angle, multigroup in energy, and isogeometric analysis (IGA) in space. We formulate operator assembly in the tensor train (TT) format, producing seven-dimensional operators for both fixed-source and $k$-eigenvalue neutron transport problems solved using the restarted Generalized Minimum Residual Method (GMRES) and power iteration with an uncompressed solution vector. Our results on single-patch homogeneous and multi-patch heterogeneous problems, including a cruciform-shaped fuel array inspired by advanced reactor fuel designs, demonstrate the TT format's ability to compress interior operators from petabytes to megabytes, whereas the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix format requires gigabytes of storage. However, highly coupled boundary operators present a significant challenge for TT. Despite the storage savings, TT formatted operators increase time-to-solution relative to CSR as an uncompressed solution vector forces operator-vector product scaling of $O(dr^2N^d\log(N))$ for TT while CSR scales at $O(\text{nnz})$. We mitigate this discrepancy by using mixed formats with interior operators in TT, while high-rank boundary operators remain in CSR format. We compare all results to Monte Carlo (MC) and analytic reference solutions. While CSR remains $&lt;10\times$ faster than this mixed format, the TDIGA method enables high-fidelity transport for expensive high-order IGA meshes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Advances in Diffusion-Based Generative Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18932</link><description>arXiv:2601.18932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popularized by their strong image generation performance, diffusion and related methods for generative modeling have found widespread success in visual media applications. In particular, diffusion methods have enabled new approaches to data compression, where realistic reconstructions can be generated at extremely low bit-rates. This article provides a unifying review of recent diffusion-based methods for generative lossy compression, with a focus on image compression. These methods generally encode the source into an embedding and employ a diffusion model to iteratively refine it in the decoding procedure, such that the final reconstruction approximately follows the ground truth data distribution. The embedding can take various forms and is typically transmitted via an auxiliary entropy model, and recent methods also explore the use of diffusion models themselves for information transmission via channel simulation.

Specifically, we show that any $c$-coloring of a set of $n$ points in the plane in general position (that is, no three on a line) contains $\Omega(n^2)$ monochromatic triangles with at most $c-1$ interior points and $\Omega(n^{\frac{4}{3}})$ monochromatic triangles with at most $c-2$ interior points, for any fixed $c \geq 2$. The latter, in particular, generalizes the result of Pach and T\'{o}th (2013) on the number of monochromatic empty triangles in 2-colored point sets, to the setting of multiple colors and monochromatic triangles with a few interior points. We also derive the limiting value of the expected number of triangles with $s$ interior points in random point sets, for any integer $s \geq 0$. As a result, we obtain the expected number of monochromatic triangles with at most $s$ interior points in random colorings of random point sets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18951v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who Restores the Peg? A Mean-Field Game Approach to Model Stablecoin Market Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18991</link><description>arXiv:2601.18991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: USDC and USDT are the dominant stablecoins pegged to \$1 with a total market capitalization of over \$300B and rising. Stablecoins make dollar value globally accessible with secure transfer and settlement. Yet in practice, these stablecoins experience periods of stress and de-pegging from their \$1 target, posing significant systemic risks. The behavior of market participants during these stress events and the collective actions that either restore or break the peg are not well understood. This paper addresses the question: who restores the peg? We develop a dynamic, agent-based mean-field game framework for fiat-collateralized stablecoins, in which a large population of arbitrageurs and retail traders strategically interacts across explicit primary (mint/redeem) and secondary (exchange) markets during a de-peg episode. The key advantage of this equilibrium formulation is that it endogenously maps market frictions into a market-clearing price path and implied net order flows, allowing us to attribute peg-reverting pressure by channel and to stress-test when a given mechanism becomes insufficient for recovery. Using three historical de-peg events, we show that the calibrated equilibrium reproduces observed recovery half-lives and yields an order flow decomposition in which system-wide stress is predominantly stabilized by primary-market arbitrage, whereas episodes with impaired primary redemption require a joint recovery via both primary and secondary markets. Finally, a quantitative sensitivity analysis of primary-rail frictions identifies a non-linear breakdown threshold. Beyond this point, secondary-market liquidity acts mainly as a second-order amplifier around this primary-market bottleneck.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18991v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mixture-Weighted Ensemble Kalman Filter with Quasi-Monte Carlo Transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18992</link><description>arXiv:2601.18992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bootstrap Particle Filter (BPF) and the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) are two widely used methods for sequential Bayesian filtering: the BPF is asymptotically exact but can suffer from weight degeneracy, while the EnKF scales well in high dimension yet is exact only in the linear-Gaussian case. We combine these approaches by retaining the EnKF transport step and adding a principled importance-sampling correction. Our first contribution is a general importance-sampling theory for mixture targets and proposals, including variance comparisons between individual- and mixture-based estimators. We then interpret the stochastic EnKF analysis as sampling from explicit Gaussian-mixture proposals obtained by conditioning on the current or previous ensemble, which leads to six self-normalized IS-EnKF schemes. We embed these updates into a broader class of ensemble-based filters and prove consistency and error bounds, including weight-variance comparisons and sufficient conditions ensuring finite-variance importance weights. As a second contribution, we construct transported quasi-Monte Carlo (TQMC) point sets for the Gaussian-mixture laws arising in prediction and analysis, yielding TQMC-enhanced variants that can substantially reduce sampling error without changing the filtering pipeline. Numerical experiments on benchmark models compare the proposed mixture-weighted and TQMC-enhanced filters, showing improved filtering accuracy relative to BPF, EnKF, and the standard weighted EnKF, and that the weighted schemes eliminate the EnKF error plateau often caused by analysis-target mismatch.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18992v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Approximation by linear sampling operators in Banach spaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19012</link><description>arXiv:2601.19012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies approximation properties of linear sampling operators in general Banach lattices $X$.

The results extend several classical theorems previously known mainly in $L_p$ and apply to all functions $f\in X$ for which the corresponding sampling operator is well defined, thereby substantially enlarging the class of functions that can be considered in this framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19012v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smooth embeddings in contracting recurrent networks driven by regular dynamics: A synthesis for neural representation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19019</link><description>arXiv:2601.19019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks trained for time-series prediction often develop latent trajectories that preserve qualitative structure of the dynamical systems generating their inputs. Recent empirical work has documented topology-preserving latent organization in trained recurrent models, and recent theoretical results in reservoir computing establish conditions under which the synchronization map is an embedding. Here we synthesize these threads into a unified account of when contracting recurrent networks yield smooth, topology-preserving internal representations for a broad and biologically relevant class of inputs: regular dynamics on invariant circles and tori.
  Our contribution is an integrated framework that assembles (i) generalized synchronization and embedding guarantees for contracting reservoirs, (ii) regularity mechanisms ensuring differentiability of the synchronization map under mild constraints, and (iii) a base-system viewpoint in which the invariant manifold generating the input stream is treated as the driving system. In this regular setting, the conditions commonly viewed as restrictive in chaotic-attractor analyses become mild and readily satisfied by standard contractive architectures. The framework clarifies how representational content in recurrent circuits is inherently historical: the network state encodes finite windows of input history rather than instantaneous stimuli.
  By consolidating disparate empirical and theoretical results under common assumptions, the synthesis yields concrete, testable expectations about when prediction-trained recurrent circuits should (or should not) form smooth latent embeddings and how required state dimension scales with the intrinsic dimension of the driving dynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The arc chromatic number for Galois projective planes, affine planes and Euclidean grids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19043</link><description>arXiv:2601.19043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that the minimum number of arcs required to partition the Galois projective plane $\text{PG}(2,q)$ is $q+1$. Furthermore, we determine the exact value for a fractional variant of this problem.
  We extend our analysis to affine planes $\text{AG}(2,q)$, proving that they can be partitioned into $q$ arcs. In particular, we show that this partition is tight when $q$ is an odd prime power, and that a $(q-1)$-partition is attainable for $q=2^k$ with $k \in \{1,2,3\}$. For $q=2^k$ with $k \geq 4$, we provide bounds between two possible values.
  Finally, we apply these results to Euclidean grids, demonstrating that a partition into $(1+\epsilon)n$ sets in general position exists for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and sufficiently large $n$. We also present exact minimal partitions for small Euclidean grids.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19043v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The cost of quantum algorithms for biochemistry: A case study in metaphosphate hydrolysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19059</link><description>arXiv:2601.19059v1 Announce Type: cross

In particular, we consider three algorithms for solving the ground state energy estimation problem: the variational quantum eigensolver, quantum Krylov, and quantum phase estimation. By utilizing exact classical simulation, numerical estimation, and analytical bounds, we provide a current and future outlook for using quantum computers to solve impactful biochemical and biological problems. Our results show that variational methods, while being the most heuristic, still require substantially fewer overall resources on quantum hardware, and could feasibly address such problems on current or near-future devices. We include our complete dataset of biomolecular Hamiltonians and code as benchmarks to improve upon with future techniques.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19059v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LvD: A New Algorithm for Computing the Likelihood of a Phylogeny</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19064</link><description>arXiv:2601.19064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are few, if any, algorithms in statistical phylogenetics which are used more heavily than Felsenstein's 1973 pruning method for computing the likelihood of a tree. We present LvD, (Likelihood via Decomposition), an alternative to Felsenstein's algorithm based on a different decomposition of the underlying phylogeny. It works for all standard nucleotide models. The new algorithm allows updates of the likelihood calculation in worst case $O(\log n)$ time with $n$ taxa, as opposed to worst case $O(n)$ time for existing methods. In practice this leads to appreciable improvements in likelihood calculations, the extent of speed-up depending on how balanced or unbalanced the trees are. We explore implications for parallel computing, and show that the approach allows likelihoods to be computed in $O(\log n)$ parallel time per site, compared to (worst case) $O(n)$ time. We implemented and applied the algorithm to large numbers of simulated and empirical data sets and showed that these theoretical advances lead to a significant practical speed-up, although the extent of the improvement depends on how balanced the phylogenies already are.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] C2NP: A Benchmark for Learning Scale-Dependent Geometric Invariances in 3D Materials Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19076</link><description>arXiv:2601.19076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models for materials have achieved strong performance on periodic bulk crystals, yet their ability to generalize across scale transitions to finite nanostructures remains largely untested. We introduce Crystal-to-Nanoparticle (C2NP), a systematic benchmark for evaluating generative models when moving between infinite crystalline unit cells and finite nanoparticles, where surface effects and size-dependent distortions dominate. C2NP defines two complementary tasks: (i) generating nanoparticles of specified radii from periodic unit cells, testing whether models capture surface truncation and geometric constraints; and (ii) recovering bulk lattice parameters and space-group symmetry from finite particle configurations, assessing whether models can infer underlying crystallographic order despite surface perturbations. Using diverse materials as a structurally consistent testbed, we construct over 170,000 nanoparticle configurations by carving particles from supercells derived from DFT-relaxed crystal unit cells, and introduce size-based splits that separate interpolation from extrapolation regimes. Experiments with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion, flow-matching, and variational models, show that even when losses are low, models often fail geometrically under distribution shift, yielding large lattice-recovery errors and near-zero joint accuracy on structure and symmetry. Overall, our results suggest that current methods rely on template memorization rather than scalable physical generalization. C2NP offers a controlled, reproducible framework for diagnosing these failures, with immediate applications to nanoparticle catalyst design, nanostructured hydrides for hydrogen storage, and materials discovery.

Abstract: Learning reduced descriptions of chaotic many-body dynamics is fundamentally challenging: although microscopic equations are Markovian, collective observables exhibit strong memory and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions and prediction errors. We show that a self-attention-based transformer framework provides an effective approach for modeling such chaotic collective dynamics directly from time-series data. By selectively reweighting long-range temporal correlations, the transformer learns a non-Markovian reduced description that overcomes intrinsic limitations of conventional recurrent architectures. As a concrete demonstration, we study the one-dimensional semiclassical Holstein model, where interaction quenches induce strongly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the charge-density-wave order parameter. While pointwise predictions inevitably diverge at long times, the transformer faithfully reproduces the statistical "climate" of the chaos, including temporal correlations and characteristic decay scales. Our results establish self-attention as a powerful mechanism for learning effective reduced dynamics in chaotic many-body systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19080v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Passive Daytime Radiative Cooling Enabled by Bio-Derived Ceramic-Polymer Coatings on Rapid-Curing Fiberglass Casts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19116</link><description>arXiv:2601.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) provides an energy-free approach to suppress surface temperatures by reflecting solar irradiation while emitting thermal radiation through the mid-infrared atmospheric window. Despite rapid progress in optical performance, most PDRC systems remain limited by rigid, fragile, or planar substrates, restricting their use on flexible, curved, or wearable surfaces. Here, we report a biocompatible and structurally robust PDRC system integrated onto a commercial rapid-curing fiberglass cast, a conformal substrate widely used in orthopedic and industrial applications. The cooling architecture adopts a bilayer polymer design consisting of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) adhesion layer and a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) protective layer, both embedded with calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) ceramic particles derived from processed animal bone waste. The bio-derived CPP simultaneously enables broadband solar scattering and high mid-infrared emittance, while offering sustainability and biocompatibility advantages. The resulting composite exhibits over 90% solar reflectance and achieves up to 15 C sub-ambient cooling under direct outdoor sunlight.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19116v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimized $k$-means color quantization of digital images in machine-based and human perception-based colorspaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19117</link><description>arXiv:2601.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color quantization represents an image using a fraction of its original number of colors while only minimally losing its visual quality. The $k$-means algorithm is commonly used in this context, but has mostly been applied in the machine-based RGB colorspace composed of the three primary colors. However, some recent studies have indicated its improved performance in human perception-based colorspaces. We investigated the performance of $k$-means color quantization at four quantization levels in the RGB, CIE-XYZ, and CIE-LUV/CIE-HCL colorspaces, on 148 varied digital images spanning a wide range of scenes, subjects and settings. The Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) measure numerically assessed the quality of the quantized images, and showed that in about half of the cases, $k$-means color quantization is best in the RGB space, while at other times, and especially for higher quantization levels ($k$), the CIE-XYZ colorspace is where it usually does better. There are also some cases, especially at lower $k$, where the best performance is obtained in the CIE-LUV colorspace. Further analysis of the performances in terms of the distributions of the hue, chromaticity and luminance in an image presents a nuanced perspective and characterization of the images for which each colorspace is better for $k$-means color quantization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19117v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convergence of Muon with Newton-Schulz</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19156</link><description>arXiv:2601.19156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze Muon as originally proposed and used in practice -- using the momentum orthogonalization with a few Newton-Schulz steps. The prior theoretical results replace this key step in Muon with an exact SVD-based polar factor. We prove that Muon with Newton-Schulz converges to a stationary point at the same rate as the SVD-polar idealization, up to a constant factor for a given number $q$ of Newton-Schulz steps. We further analyze this constant factor and prove that it converges to 1 doubly exponentially in $q$ and improves with the degree of the polynomial used in Newton-Schulz for approximating the orthogonalization direction. We also prove that Muon removes the typical square-root-of-rank loss compared to its vector-based counterpart, SGD with momentum. Our results explain why Muon with a few low-degree Newton-Schulz steps matches exact-polar (SVD) behavior at a much faster wall-clock time and explain how much momentum matrix orthogonalization via Newton-Schulz benefits over the vector-based optimizer. Overall, our theory justifies the practical Newton-Schulz design of Muon, narrowing its practice-theory gap.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Double Fairness Policy Learning: Integrating Action Fairness and Outcome Fairness in Decision-making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19186</link><description>arXiv:2601.19186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness is a central pillar of trustworthy machine learning, especially in domains where accuracy- or profit-driven optimization is insufficient. While most fairness research focuses on supervised learning, fairness in policy learning remains less explored. Because policy learning is interventional, it induces two distinct fairness targets: action fairness (equitable action assignments) and outcome fairness (equitable downstream consequences). Crucially, equalizing actions does not generally equalize outcomes when groups face different constraints or respond differently to the same action. We propose a novel double fairness learning (DFL) framework that explicitly manages the trade-off among three objectives: action fairness, outcome fairness, and value maximization. We integrate fairness directly into a multi-objective optimization problem for policy learning and employ a lexicographic weighted Tchebyshev method that recovers Pareto solutions beyond convex settings, with theoretical guarantees on the regret bounds. Our framework is flexible and accommodates various commonly used fairness notions. Extensive simulations demonstrate improved performance relative to competing methods. In applications to a motor third-party liability insurance dataset and an entrepreneurship training dataset, DFL substantially improves both action and outcome fairness while incurring only a modest reduction in overall value.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SE-DiCoW: Self-Enrolled Diarization-Conditioned Whisper</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19194</link><description>arXiv:2601.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multi-speaker environments remains a major challenge. While some approaches achieve strong performance when fine-tuned on specific domains, few systems generalize well across out-of-domain datasets. Our prior work, Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW), leverages speaker diarization outputs as conditioning information and, with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrated strong multilingual and multi-domain performance. In this paper, we address a key limitation of DiCoW: ambiguity in Silence-Target-Non-target-Overlap (STNO) masks, where two or more fully overlapping speakers may have nearly identical conditioning despite differing transcriptions. We introduce SE-DiCoW (Self-Enrolled Diarization-Conditioned Whisper), which uses diarization output to locate an enrollment segment anywhere in the conversation where the target speaker is most active. This enrollment segment is used as fixed conditioning via cross-attention at each encoder layer. We further refine DiCoW with improved data segmentation, model initialization, and augmentation. Together, these advances yield substantial gains: SE-DiCoW reduces macro-averaged tcpWER by 52.4% relative to the original DiCoW on the EMMA MT-ASR benchmark.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19194v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EnzyPGM: Pocket-conditioned Generative Model for Substrate-specific Enzyme Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19205</link><description>arXiv:2601.19205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing enzymes with substrate-binding pockets is a critical challenge in protein engineering, as catalytic activity depends on the precise interaction between pockets and substrates. Currently, generative models dominate functional protein design but cannot model pocket-substrate interactions, which limits the generation of enzymes with precise catalytic environments. To address this issue, we propose EnzyPGM, a unified framework that jointly generates enzymes and substrate-binding pockets conditioned on functional priors and substrates, with a particular focus on learning accurate pocket-substrate interactions. At its core, EnzyPGM includes two main modules: a Residue-atom Bi-scale Attention (RBA) that jointly models intra-residue dependencies and fine-grained interactions between pocket residues and substrate atoms, and a Residue Function Fusion (RFF) that incorporates enzyme function priors into residue representations. Also, we curate EnzyPock, an enzyme-pocket dataset comprising 83,062 enzyme-substrate pairs across 1,036 four-level enzyme families. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EnzyPGM achieves state-of-the-art performance on EnzyPock. Notably, EnzyPGM reduces the average binding energy of 0.47 kcal/mol over EnzyGen, showing its superior performance on substrate-specific enzyme design. The code and dataset will be released later.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19205v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PCEvo: Path-Consistent Molecular Representation via Virtual Evolutionary</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19257</link><description>arXiv:2601.19257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular representation learning aims to learn vector embeddings that capture molecular structure and geometry, thereby enabling property prediction and downstream scientific applications. In many AI for science tasks, labeled data are expensive to obtain and therefore limited in availability. Under the few-shot setting, models trained with scarce supervision often learn brittle structure-property relationships, resulting in substantially higher prediction errors and reduced generalization to unseen molecules. To address this limitation, we propose PCEvo, a path-consistent representation method that learns from virtual paths through dynamic structural evolution. PCEvo enumerates multiple chemically feasible edit paths between retrieved similar molecular pairs under topological dependency constraints. It transforms the labels of the two molecules into stepwise supervision along each virtual evolutionary path. It introduces a path-consistency objective that enforces prediction invariance across alternative paths connecting the same two molecules. Comprehensive experiments on the QM9 and MoleculeNet datasets demonstrate that PCEvo substantially improves the few-shot generalization performance of baseline methods.

This implies an analogue of the union-closed sets conjecture for approximate $k$-union closed set systems.

Abstract: Multimodal MRI is essential for brain tumor segmentation, yet missing modalities in clinical practice cause existing methods to exhibit &gt;40% performance variance across modality combinations, rendering them clinically unreliable.

Abstract: Obstructions such as raindrops, fences, or dust degrade captured images, especially when mechanical cleaning is infeasible. Conventional solutions to obstructions rely on a bulky compound optics array or computational inpainting, which compromise compactness or fidelity. Metalenses composed of subwavelength meta-atoms promise compact imaging, but simultaneous achievement of broadband and obstruction-free imaging remains a challenge, since a metalens that images distant scenes across a broadband spectrum cannot properly defocus near-depth occlusions. Here, we introduce a learned split-spectrum metalens that enables broadband obstruction-free imaging. Our approach divides the spectrum of each RGB channel into pass and stop bands with multi-band spectral filtering and learns the metalens to focus light from far objects through pass bands, while filtering focused near-depth light through stop bands. This optical signal is further enhanced using a neural network. Our learned split-spectrum metalens achieves broadband and obstruction-free imaging with relative PSNR gains of 32.29% and improves object detection and semantic segmentation accuracies with absolute gains of +13.54% mAP, +48.45% IoU, and +20.35% mIoU over a conventional hyperbolic design. This promises robust obstruction-free sensing and vision for space-constrained systems, such as mobile robots, drones, and endoscopes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19403v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Jacobi-Pi\~neiro Multiple Orthogonal Polynomials on the simplex</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19416</link><description>arXiv:2601.19416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that Rodrigues formulas provide a very powerful tool to compute orthogonal polynomials with respect to classical weights. We provide an example of bivariate multiple polynomials on the simplex defined via a Rodrigues formula. This approach offers a natural generalization of Jacobi--Pi\~neiro polynomials to the multivariate setting.

Abstract: This paper presents a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the estimation of parameters confined to an arbitrary set. Unlike existing results that rely on equality or inequality constraints, manifold structures, or the nonsingularity of the Fisher information matrix, the derived CRB applies to any constrained set and holds for any estimation bias and any Fisher information matrix. The key geometric object governing the new CRB is the tangent cone to the constraint set, whose span determines how the constraints affect the estimation accuracy. This CRB subsumes, unifies, and generalizes known special cases, offering an intuitive and broadly applicable framework to characterize the minimum mean-square error of constrained estimators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19539v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalizable Equivariant Diffusion Models for Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19552</link><description>arXiv:2601.19552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that gauge equivariant diffusion models can accurately model the physics of non-Abelian lattice gauge theory using the Metropolis-adjusted annealed Langevin algorithm (MAALA), as exemplified by computations in two-dimensional U(2) and SU(2) gauge theories. Our network architecture is based on lattice gauge equivariant convolutional neural networks (L-CNNs), which respect local and global symmetries on the lattice. Models are trained on a single ensemble generated using a traditional Monte Carlo method. By studying Wilson loops of various size as well as the topological susceptibility, we find that the diffusion approach generalizes remarkably well to larger inverse couplings and lattice sizes with negligible loss of accuracy while retaining moderately high acceptance rates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19552v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning the Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou Trajectories: A Nonlinear Approach using a Deep Autoencoder Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19567</link><description>arXiv:2601.19567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the intrinsic dimensionality (ID) of high-dimensional trajectories, comprising $n_s = 4\,000\,000$ data points, of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ oscillators. To this end, a deep autoencoder (DAE) model is employed to infer the ID in the weakly nonlinear regime ($\beta \lesssim 1$). We find that the trajectories lie on a nonlinear manifold of dimension $m^{\ast} = 2$ embedded in a $64$-dimensional phase space. The DAE further reveals that this dimensionality increases to $m^{\ast} = 3$ at $\beta = 1.1$, coinciding with a symmetry breaking transition, in which additional energy modes with even wave numbers $k = 2, 4$ become excited. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the linear approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), which fails to capture the underlying structure of the data and therefore yields unreliable results in most cases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19567v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the rarity of rocket-driven Penrose extraction in Kerr spacetime</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19616</link><description>arXiv:2601.19616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo study of energy extraction from rotating (Kerr) black holes via the Penrose process using rocket propulsion. Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific "sweet spot," success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($\eta_{\rm cum} \approx 19\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel numerical method for computing the density of the limit random variable associated with a supercritical Galton-Watson process. This random variable captures the effect of early demographic fluctuations and determines the random amplitude of long-term exponential population growth. While the existence of a non-trivial limit is ensured by the Kesten-Stigum theorem, computing its density in a stable and efficient manner for arbitrary offspring laws remains a significant challenge. The proposed approach leverages a functional equation that characterizes the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the limit distribution and combines it with a moment-matching method to obtain accurate approximations within a class of linear combinations of Laguerre polynomials with exponential damping. The effectiveness of the approach is validated on several examples in which the offspring generating function is a polynomial of bounded degree.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19633v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DynQ: A Dynamic Topology-Agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine via Quality-Weighted Community Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19635</link><description>arXiv:2601.19635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cloud platforms remain fundamentally non-virtualised: despite rapid hardware scaling, each user program still monopolises an entire quantum processor, preventing resource sharing, economic scalability, and quality-of-service differentiation. Existing Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) designs attempt spatial multiplexing through topology-specific or template-based partitioning, but these approaches are brittle under hardware heterogeneity, calibration drift, and transient defects, which dominate real quantum devices. We present DynQ, the first dynamic, topology-agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine that virtualises quantum hardware using quality-weighted community detection. Instead of imposing fixed geometric regions, DynQ models a quantum processor as a weighted graph derived from live calibration data and automatically discovers execution regions that maximise internal gate quality while minimising inter-region coupling. This operationalises the classical virtualisation principle of high cohesion and low coupling in a quantum-native setting, producing execution regions that are connectivity-efficient, noise-aware, and resilient to crosstalk and defects. We evaluate DynQ across five IBM Quantum backends using calibration-derived noise simulation and on two production devices, comparing against state-of-the-art QVM and standard compilation baselines. On hardware with pronounced spatial quality variation, DynQ achieves up to 19.1 percent higher fidelity and 45.1 percent lower output error. When transient hardware defects cause baseline executions to fail completely, DynQ adapts dynamically and achieves over 86 percent fidelity. By transforming calibrated device graphs into adaptive virtual hardware abstractions, DynQ decouples quantum programs from fragile physical layouts and enables reliable, high-utilisation quantum cloud services.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19635v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAM Audio Judge: A Unified Multimodal Framework for Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Separation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19702</link><description>arXiv:2601.19702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance evaluation remains a complex challenge in audio separation, and existing evaluation metrics are often misaligned with human perception, course-grained, relying on ground truth signals. On the other hand, subjective listening tests remain the gold standard for real-world evaluation, but they are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. This paper addresses the growing need for automated systems capable of evaluating audio separation without human intervention. The proposed evaluation metric, SAM Audio Judge (SAJ), is a multimodal fine-grained reference-free objective metric, which shows highly alignment with human perceptions. SAJ supports three audio domains (speech, music and general sound events) and three prompt inputs (text, visual and span), covering four different dimensions of evaluation (recall, percision, faithfulness, and overall). SAM Audio Judge also shows potential applications in data filtering, pseudo-labeling large datasets and reranking in audio separation models.

Abstract: The data volumes generated by modern radio interferometers, such as the SKA precursors, present significant computational challenges for imaging pipelines. Addressing the need for high-performance, portable, and scalable software, we present RICK 2.0 (Radio Imaging Code Kernels). This work introduces a novel implementation that leverages the HeFFTe library for distributed Fast Fourier Transforms, ensuring portability across diverse HPC architectures, including multi-core CPUs and accelerators. We validate RICK's correctness and performance against real observational data from both MeerKAT and LOFAR. Our results demonstrate that the HeFFTe-based implementation offers substantial performance advantages, particularly when running on GPUs, and scales effectively with large pixel resolutions and a high number of frequency planes. This new architecture overcomes the critical scaling limitations identified in previous work (Paper II, Paper III), where communication overheads consumed up to 96% of the runtime due to the necessity of communicating the entire grid. This new RICK version drastically reduces this communication impact, representing a scalable and efficient imaging solution ready for the SKA era.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19714v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpretable and backpropagation-free Green Learning for efficient multi-task echocardiographic segmentation and classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19743</link><description>arXiv:2601.19743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Echocardiography is a cornerstone for managing heart failure (HF), with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) being a critical metric for guiding therapy. However, manual LVEF assessment suffers from high inter-observer variability, while existing Deep Learning (DL) models are often computationally intensive and data-hungry "black boxes" that impede clinical trust and adoption. Here, we propose a backpropagation-free multi-task Green Learning (MTGL) framework that performs simultaneous Left Ventricle (LV) segmentation and LVEF classification. Our framework integrates an unsupervised VoxelHop encoder for hierarchical spatio-temporal feature extraction with a multi-level regression decoder and an XG-Boost classifier. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our MTGL model achieves state-of-the-art classification and segmentation performance, attaining a classification accuracy of 94.3% and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.912, significantly outperforming several advanced 3D DL models. Crucially, our model achieves this with over an order of magnitude fewer parameters, demonstrating exceptional computational efficiency. This work demonstrates that the GL paradigm can deliver highly accurate, efficient, and interpretable solutions for complex medical image analysis, paving the way for more sustainable and trustworthy artificial intelligence in clinical practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19743v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Regularized $f$-Divergence Kernel Tests</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19755</link><description>arXiv:2601.19755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to construct practical kernel-based two-sample tests from the family of $f$-divergences. The test statistic is computed from the witness function of a regularized variational representation of the divergence, which we estimate using kernel methods. The proposed test is adaptive over hyperparameters such as the kernel bandwidth and the regularization parameter. We provide theoretical guarantees for statistical test power across our family of $f$-divergence estimates. While our test covers a variety of $f$-divergences, we bring particular focus to the Hockey-Stick divergence, motivated by its applications to differential privacy auditing and machine unlearning evaluation. For two-sample testing, experiments demonstrate that different $f$-divergences are sensitive to different localized differences, illustrating the importance of leveraging diverse statistics. For machine unlearning, we propose a relative test that distinguishes true unlearning failures from safe distributional variations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19755v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Discrete Speech Representation Tokens for Accent Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19786</link><description>arXiv:2601.19786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete Speech Representation Tokens (DSRTs) have become a foundational component in speech generation. While prior work has extensively studied phonetic and speaker information in DSRTs, how accent information is encoded in DSRTs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of accent information in DSRTs. We propose a unified evaluation framework that measures both accessibility of accent information via a novel Accent ABX task and recoverability via cross-accent Voice Conversion (VC) resynthesis. Using this framework, we analyse DSRTs derived from a variety of speech encoders. Our results reveal that accent information is substantially reduced when ASR supervision is used to fine-tune the encoder, but cannot be effectively disentangled from phonetic and speaker information through naive codebook size reduction. Based on these findings, we propose new content-only and content-accent DSRTs that significantly outperform existing designs in controllable accent generation. Our work highlights the importance of accent-aware evaluation and provides practical guidance for designing DSRTs for accent-controlled speech generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19786v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nonequilibrium phase transitions in a racism-spreading model with interaction-driven dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19806</link><description>arXiv:2601.19806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Racism remains a persistent societal issue, increasingly amplified by the structure and dynamics of online social networks. In this work, we propose a three-state compartmental model to study the spreading and suppression of racist content, drawing from epidemic-like dynamics and interaction-driven transitions. We analyze the model on fully-connected (homogeneous mixing) networks using a set of coupled differential equations, and on Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) scale-free and Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world networks through agent-based simulations. The system exhibits three distinct stationary regimes: two racism-free absorbing states and one active phase with persistent racist content. We identify and characterize the phase transitions between these regimes, discuss the role of network topology, and highlight the emergence of absorbing states. Our findings illustrate how statistical physics tools can help uncover the macroscopic consequences of microscopic social interactions in digital environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Incremental Stochastic Majorization-Minimization Algorithms with Applications to Mixture of Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19811</link><description>arXiv:2601.19811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing high-volume, streaming data is increasingly common in modern statistics and machine learning, where batch-mode algorithms are often impractical because they require repeated passes over the full dataset. This has motivated incremental stochastic estimation methods, including the incremental stochastic Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm formulated via stochastic approximation. In this work, we revisit and analyze an incremental stochastic variant of the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm, which generalizes incremental stochastic EM as a special case. Our approach relaxes key EM requirements, such as explicit latent-variable representations, enabling broader applicability and greater algorithmic flexibility. We establish theoretical guarantees for the incremental stochastic MM algorithm, proving consistency in the sense that the iterates converge to a stationary point characterized by a vanishing gradient of the objective. We demonstrate these advantages on a softmax-gated mixture of experts (MoE) regression problem, for which no stochastic EM algorithm is available. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms widely used stochastic optimizers, including stochastic gradient descent, root mean square propagation, adaptive moment estimation, and second-order clipped stochastic optimization. These results support the development of new incremental stochastic algorithms, given the central role of softmax-gated MoE architectures in contemporary deep neural networks for heterogeneous data modeling. Beyond synthetic experiments, we also validate practical effectiveness on two real-world datasets, including a bioinformatics study of dent maize genotypes under drought stress that integrates high-dimensional proteomics with ecophysiological traits, where incremental stochastic MM yields stable gains in predictive performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19811v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Abundance and Economic diversity as a descriptor of cities' economic complexity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19814</link><description>arXiv:2601.19814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intricate interactions among firms, institutions, and spatial structures shape urban economic systems. In this study, we propose a framework based on three structural dimensions -- abundance, diversity, and longevity (ADL) of economic units -- as proxies of urban economic complexity and resilience. Using a decade of georeferenced firm-level data from Mexico City, we analyze the relationships among ADL variables using regression, spatial correlation, and time-series clustering. Our results reveal nonlinear dynamics across urban space, with powerlaw behavior in central zones and logarithmic saturation in peripheral areas, suggesting differentiated growth regimes. Notably, firm longevity modulates the relationship between abundance and diversity, particularly in periurban transition zones. These spatial patterns point to an emerging polycentric restructuring within a traditionally monocentric metropolis. By integrating economic complexity theory with spatial analysis, our approach provides a scalable method to assess the adaptive capacity of urban economies. This has implications for understanding informality, designing inclusive urban policies, and navigating structural transitions in rapidly urbanizing regions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19814v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative Latent Alignment for Interpretable Radar Based Occupancy Detection in Ambient Assisted Living</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19853</link><description>arXiv:2601.19853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study how to make mmWave radar presence detection more interpretable for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) settings, where camera-based sensing raises privacy concerns. We propose a Generative Latent Alignment (GLA) framework that combines a lightweight convolutional variational autoencoder with a frozen CLIP text encoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of radar Range-Angle (RA) heatmaps. The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to "empty room" and "person present", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the "person present" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas "empty room" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19853v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI Cap-and-Trade: Efficiency Incentives for Accessibility and Sustainability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19886</link><description>arXiv:2601.19886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The race for artificial intelligence (AI) dominance often prioritizes scale over efficiency. Hyper-scaling is the common industry approach: larger models, more data, and as many computational resources as possible. Using more resources is a simpler path to improved AI performance. Thus, efficiency has been de-emphasized. Consequently, the need for costly computational resources has marginalized academics and smaller companies. Simultaneously, increased energy expenditure, due to growing AI use, has led to mounting environmental costs. In response to accessibility and sustainability concerns, we argue for research into, and implementation of, market-based methods that incentivize AI efficiency. We believe that incentivizing efficient operations and approaches will reduce emissions while opening new opportunities for academics and smaller companies. As a call to action, we propose a cap-and-trade system for AI. Our system provably reduces computations for AI deployment, thereby lowering emissions and monetizing efficiency to the benefit of of academics and smaller companies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] M-SGWR: Multiscale Similarity and Geographically Weighted Regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19888</link><description>arXiv:2601.19888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first law of geography is a cornerstone of spatial analysis, emphasizing that nearby and related locations tend to be more similar, however, defining what constitutes "near" and "related" remains challenging, as different phenomena exhibit distinct spatial patterns. Traditional local regression models, such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale GWR (MGWR), quantify spatial relationships solely through geographic proximity. In an era of globalization and digital connectivity, however, geographic proximity alone may be insufficient to capture how locations are interconnected. To address this limitation, we propose a new multiscale local regression framework, termed M-SGWR, which characterizes spatial interaction across two dimensions: geographic proximity and attribute (variable) similarity. For each predictor, geographic and attribute-based weight matrices are constructed separately and then combined using an optimized parameter, alpha, which governs their relative contribution to local model fitting. Analogous to variable-specific bandwidths in MGWR, the optimal alpha varies by predictor, allowing the model to flexibly account for geographic, mixed, or non-spatial (remote similarity) effects. Results from two simulation experiments and one empirical application demonstrate that M-SGWR consistently outperforms GWR, SGWR, and MGWR across all goodness-of-fit metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19888v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Image deblurring based on lightweight multi-information fusion network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05403</link><description>arXiv:2101.05403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning based image deblurring has been well developed. However, exploiting the detailed image features in a deep learning framework always requires a mass of parameters, which inevitably makes the network suffer from high computational burden. To solve this problem, we propose a lightweight multiinformation fusion network (LMFN) for image deblurring. The proposed LMFN is designed as an encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoding stage, the image feature is reduced to various smallscale spaces for multi-scale information extraction and fusion without a large amount of information loss. Then, a distillation network is used in the decoding stage, which allows the network benefit the most from residual learning while remaining sufficiently lightweight. Meanwhile, an information fusion strategy between distillation modules and feature channels is also carried out by attention mechanism. Through fusing different information in the proposed approach, our network can achieve state-of-the-art image deblurring result with smaller number of parameters and outperforms existing methods in model complexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2101.05403v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Ensembling with No Overhead for either Training or Testing: The All-Round Blessings of Dynamic Sparsity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14568</link><description>arXiv:2106.14568v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of deep ensembles on improving predictive performance, uncertainty estimation, and out-of-distribution robustness has been extensively studied in the machine learning literature. Albeit the promising results, naively training multiple deep neural networks and combining their predictions at inference leads to prohibitive computational costs and memory requirements. Recently proposed efficient ensemble approaches reach the performance of the traditional deep ensembles with significantly lower costs. However, the training resources required by these approaches are still at least the same as training a single dense model. In this work, we draw a unique connection between sparse neural network training and deep ensembles, yielding a novel efficient ensemble learning framework called FreeTickets. Instead of training multiple dense networks and averaging them, we directly train sparse subnetworks from scratch and extract diverse yet accurate subnetworks during this efficient, sparse-to-sparse training. Our framework, FreeTickets, is defined as the ensemble of these relatively cheap sparse subnetworks. Despite being an ensemble method, FreeTickets has even fewer parameters and training FLOPs than a single dense model. This seemingly counter-intuitive outcome is due to the ultra training/inference efficiency of dynamic sparse training. FreeTickets surpasses the dense baseline in all the following criteria: prediction accuracy, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OoD) robustness, as well as efficiency for both training and inference. Impressively, FreeTickets outperforms the naive deep ensemble with ResNet50 on ImageNet using around only 1/5 of the training FLOPs required by the latter. We have released our source code at https://github.com/VITA-Group/FreeTickets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2106.14568v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differential privacy for symmetric log-concave mechanisms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11393</link><description>arXiv:2202.11393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adding random noise to database query results is an important tool for achieving privacy. A challenge is to minimize this noise while still meeting privacy requirements. Recently, a sufficient and necessary condition for $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy for Gaussian noise was published. This condition allows the computation of the minimum privacy-preserving scale for this distribution. We extend this work and provide a sufficient and necessary condition for $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy for all symmetric and log-concave noise densities. Our results allow fine-grained tailoring of the noise distribution to the dimensionality of the query result. We demonstrate that this can yield significantly lower mean squared errors than those incurred by the currently used Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms for the same $\epsilon$ and $\delta$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2202.11393v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Leafed Induced Subtree in chordal and bounded treewidth graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12783</link><description>arXiv:2301.12783v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Fully Leafed Induced Subtrees, one is given a graph $G$ and two integers $a$ and $b$ and the question is to find an induced subtree of $G$ with $a$ vertices and at least $b$ leaves. This problem is known to be NP-complete even when the input graph is $4$-regular. Polynomial algorithms are known when the input graph is restricted to be a tree or series-parallel. In this paper we generalize these results by providing an FPT algorithm parameterized by treewidth. We also provide a polynomial algorithm when the input graph is restricted to be a chordal graph.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2301.12783v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CNN-based IoT Device Identification: A Comparative Study on Payload vs. Fingerprint</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13894</link><description>arXiv:2304.13894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced a massive influx of devices into the market, bringing with them significant security vulnerabilities. In this diverse ecosystem, robust IoT device identification is a critical preventive measure for network security and vulnerability management. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to identify IoT devices using the Aalto dataset. We employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify devices by converting network packet payloads into pseudo-images. Furthermore, we compare the performance of this payload-based approach against a feature-based fingerprinting method. Our results indicate that while the fingerprint-based method is significantly faster (approximately 10x), the payload-based image classification achieves comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-offs between computational efficiency and data granularity in IoT security.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2304.13894v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An efficient, provably optimal algorithm for the 0-1 loss linear classification problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12344</link><description>arXiv:2306.12344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithms for solving the linear classification problem have a long history, dating back at least to 1936 with linear discriminant analysis. For linearly separable data, many algorithms can obtain the exact solution to the corresponding 0-1 loss classification problem efficiently, but for data which is not linearly separable, it has been shown that this problem, in full generality, is NP-hard. Alternative approaches all involve approximations of some kind, such as the use of surrogates for the 0-1 loss (for example, the hinge or logistic loss), none of which can be guaranteed to solve the problem exactly. Finding an efficient, rigorously proven algorithm for obtaining an exact (i.e., globally optimal) solution to the 0-1 loss linear classification problem remains an open problem. By analyzing the combinatorial and incidence relations between hyperplanes and data points, we derive a rigorous construction algorithm, incremental cell enumeration (ICE), that can solve the 0-1 loss classification problem exactly in $O(N^{D+1})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first standalone algorithm-one that does not rely on general-purpose solvers-with rigorously proven guarantees for this problem. Moreover, we further generalize ICE to address the polynomial hypersurface classification problem in $O(N^{G+1})$ time, where $G$ is determined by both the data dimension and the polynomial hypersurface degree. The correctness of our algorithm is proved by the use of tools from the theory of hyperplane arrangements and oriented matroids. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on real-world datasets, achieving optimal training accuracy for small-scale datasets and higher test accuracy on most datasets. Furthermore, our complexity analysis shows that the ICE algorithm offers superior computational efficiency compared with state-of-the-art branch-and-bound algorithm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2306.12344v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cloud and AI Infrastructure Cost Optimization: A Comprehensive Review of Strategies and Case Studies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12479</link><description>arXiv:2307.12479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud computing has revolutionized the way organizations manage their IT infrastructure, but it has also introduced new challenges, such as managing cloud costs. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads has further amplified these challenges, with GPU compute now representing 40-60\% of technical budgets for AI-focused organizations. This paper provides a comprehensive review of cloud and AI infrastructure cost optimization techniques, covering traditional cloud pricing models, resource allocation strategies, and emerging approaches for managing AI/ML workloads. We examine the dramatic cost reductions in large language model (LLM) inference which has decreased by approximately 10x annually since 2021 and explore techniques such as model quantization, GPU instance selection, and inference optimization. Real-world case studies from Amazon Prime Video, Pinterest, Cloudflare, and Netflix showcase practical application of these techniques. Our analysis reveals that organizations can achieve 50-90% cost savings through strategic optimization approaches. Future research directions in automated optimization, sustainability, and AI-specific cost management are proposed to advance the state of the art in this rapidly evolving field.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2307.12479v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ThinkNote: Enhancing Knowledge Integration and Utilization of Large Language Models via Constructivist Cognition Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13547</link><description>arXiv:2402.13547v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, they often exhibit suboptimal behaviors and inconsistencies when exposed to unfamiliar external information, underscoring their limitations in effectively leveraging such knowledge. Inspired by constructivist learning theory, we propose ThinkNote, a novel framework that enhances the external knowledge utilization of LLMs through a two-stage constructivist cognitive modeling process. Specifically, ThinkNote performs knowledge assimilation to align new information with the model's parametric memory, forming a coherent internal representation. It then applies thought accommodation to adapt internal reasoning, thereby promoting more consistent and reliable outputs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ThinkNote achieves a 10% improvement over strong baseline methods on various question-answering benchmarks. Further analysis indicates that ThinkNote effectively integrates and utilizes external knowledge to help LLMs generate accurate responses and improves their self-consistency.

Abstract: We propose data-recovery schemes to improve the uplink reliability of Internet of Things (IoT) networks in which a gateway mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collects data from sensor nodes on the ground. The proposed techniques employ fountain coding and message replication to correct frame erasures on the sensor-to-UAV links. A salient feature of the proposed schemes is their adaptive selection of the redundancy amount depending on the contact times between a sensor and the UAV. We illustrate our design philosophy for the special case of a network in which wake-up radios (WuRs) are used for activating the sensors upon the UAV's arrival, and the sensor-to-UAV data transfer employs the Long Range (LoRa) communication technology with random access.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2403.09782v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15651</link><description>arXiv:2403.15651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2403.15651v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Watermark-based Attribution of AI-Generated Content</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04254</link><description>arXiv:2404.04254v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several companies have deployed watermark-based detection to identify AI-generated content. However, attribution--the ability to trace back to the user of a generative AI (GenAI) service who created a given AI-generated content--remains largely unexplored despite its growing importance. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting the first systematic study on watermark-based, user-level attribution of AI-generated content. Our key idea is to assign a unique watermark to each user of the GenAI service and embed this watermark into the AI-generated content created by that user. Attribution is then performed by identifying the user whose watermark best matches the one extracted from the given content. This approach, however, faces a key challenge: How should watermarks be selected for users to maximize attribution performance? To address the challenge, we first theoretically derive lower bounds on detection and attribution performance through rigorous probabilistic analysis for any given set of user watermarks. Then, we select watermarks for users to maximize these lower bounds, thereby optimizing detection and attribution performance. Our theoretical and empirical results show that watermark-based attribution inherits both the accuracy and (non-)robustness properties of the underlying watermark. Specifically, attribution remains highly accurate when the watermarked AI-generated content is either not post-processed or subjected to common post-processing such as JPEG compression, as well as black-box adversarial post-processing with limited query budgets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.04254v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cycles of Well-Linked Sets I: an Elementary Bound for Directed Cycle Packing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19222</link><description>arXiv:2404.19222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1996, Reed, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas [Combinatorica 1996] proved Younger's Conjecture, which states that, for all directed graphs $D$, there exists a function $f$ such that, if $D$ does not contain $k$ disjoint cycles, then $D$ contains a feedback vertex set, i.e.~a subset of vertices whose deletion renders the graph acyclic, of size bounded by $f(k)$. However, the function obtained by Reed, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas in their paper is enormous and, in fact, not even elementary. We prove the first elementary upper bound for the function $f$ above, showing it is upper-bounded by a power tower of height 8.
  Our proof is inspired by the breakthrough result of Chekuri and Chuzhoy [J.~ACM 2016], who proved a polynomial bound for the Excluded Grid Theorem for undirected graphs. We translate a key concept of their proof to directed graphs by introducing \emph{paths of well-linked sets (PWS)}, and show that any digraph of large directed treewidth contains a large PWS, which in turn contains a large fence.
  We believe that the theoretical tools developed in this work may find applications beyond the results above, in a similar way as the path-of-sets-system framework due to Chekuri and Chuzhoy [J.~ACM 2016] did for undirected graphs (see, for example, Hatzel, Komosa, Pilipczuk and Sorge [Discret.~Math.~Theor.~Comput.~Sci.~2022], Chekuri and Chuzhoy [SODA 2015] and Chuzhoy and Nimavat [arXiv 2019]). Indeed, in a follow-up paper, we apply this framework to improve the bounds of the Directed Grid Theorem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.19222v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] General Binding Affinity Guidance for Diffusion Models in Structure-Based Drug Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16821</link><description>arXiv:2406.16821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate ligands that bind strongly and specifically to target protein pockets. Recent diffusion models have advanced SBDD by capturing the distributions of atomic positions and types, yet they often underemphasize binding affinity control during generation. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{\textnormal{\textbf{BADGER}}}, a general \textbf{binding-affinity guidance framework for diffusion models in SBDD}. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} }incorporates binding affinity awareness through two complementary strategies: (1) \textit{classifier guidance}, which applies gradient-based affinity signals during sampling in a plug-and-play fashion, and (2) \textit{classifier-free guidance}, which integrates affinity conditioning directly into diffusion model training. Together, these approaches enable controllable ligand generation guided by binding affinity. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} } can be added to any diffusion model and achieves up to a \textbf{60\% improvement in ligand--protein binding affinity} of sampled molecules over prior methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework to \textbf{multi-constraint diffusion guidance}, jointly optimizing for binding affinity, drug-likeness (QED), and synthetic accessibility (SA) to design realistic and synthesizable drug candidates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.16821v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A simple algorithm for output range analysis for deep neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02700</link><description>arXiv:2407.02700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for the output range estimation problem in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by integrating a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm tailored to operate within constrained domains and ensure convergence towards global optima. The method effectively addresses the challenges posed by the lack of local geometric information and the high non-linearity inherent to DNNs, making it applicable to a wide variety of architectures, with a special focus on Residual Networks (ResNets) due to their practical importance. Unlike existing methods, our algorithm imposes minimal assumptions on the internal architecture of neural networks, thereby extending its usability to complex models. Theoretical analysis guarantees convergence, while extensive empirical evaluations-including optimization tests involving functions with multiple local minima-demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm in navigating non-convex response surfaces. The experimental results highlight the algorithm's efficiency in accurately estimating DNN output ranges, even in scenarios characterized by high non-linearity and complex constraints.

Abstract: Travel time estimation is a key task in navigation apps and web mapping services. Existing deterministic and probabilistic methods, based on the assumption of trip independence, predominantly focus on modeling individual trips while overlooking trip correlations. However, real-world conditions frequently introduce strong correlations between trips, influenced by external and internal factors such as weather and the tendencies of drivers. To address this, we propose a deep hierarchical joint probabilistic model ProbETA for travel time estimation, capturing both inter-trip and intra-trip correlations. The joint distribution of travel times across multiple trips is modeled as a low-rank multivariate Gaussian, parameterized by learnable link representations estimated using the empirical Bayes approach. We also introduce a data augmentation method based on trip sub-sampling, allowing for fine-grained gradient backpropagation when learning link representations. During inference, our model estimates the probability distribution of travel time for a queried trip, conditional on spatiotemporally adjacent completed trips. Evaluation on two real-world GPS trajectory datasets demonstrates that ProbETA outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic baselines, with Mean Absolute Percentage Error decreasing by over 12.60%. Moreover, the learned link representations align with the physical network geometry, potentially making them applicable for other tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.05895v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Epistemological Bias As a Means for the Automated Detection of Injustices in Text</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06098</link><description>arXiv:2407.06098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Injustices in text are often subtle since implicit biases or stereotypes frequently operate unconsciously due to the pervasive nature of prejudice in society. This makes automated detection of injustices more challenging which leads to them being often overlooked. We introduce a novel framework that combines knowledge from epistemology to enhance the detection of implicit injustices in text using NLP models to address these complexities and offer explainability. Our empirical study shows how our framework can be applied to effectively detect these injustices. We validate our framework using a human baseline study which mostly agrees with the choice of implicit bias, stereotype, and sentiment. The main feedback from the study was the extended time required to analyze, digest, and decide on each component of our framework. This highlights the importance of our automated framework pipeline that assists users in detecting implicit injustices while offering explainability and reducing time burdens on humans.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.06098v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Have ASkotch: A Neat Solution for Large-scale Kernel Ridge Regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10070</link><description>arXiv:2407.10070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a fundamental computational tool, appearing in problems that range from computational chemistry to health analytics, with a particular interest due to its starring role in Gaussian process regression. However, full KRR solvers are challenging to scale to large datasets: both direct (i.e., Cholesky decomposition) and iterative methods (i.e., PCG) incur prohibitive computational and storage costs. The standard approach to scale KRR to large datasets chooses a set of inducing points and solves an approximate version of the problem, inducing points KRR. However, the resulting solution tends to have worse predictive performance than the full KRR solution. In this work, we introduce a new solver, ASkotch, for full KRR that provides better solutions faster than state-of-the-art solvers for full and inducing points KRR. ASkotch is a scalable, accelerated, iterative method for full KRR that provably obtains linear convergence. Under appropriate conditions, we show that ASkotch obtains condition-number-free linear convergence. This convergence analysis rests on the theory of ridge leverage scores and determinantal point processes. ASkotch outperforms state-of-the-art KRR solvers on a testbed of 23 large-scale KRR regression and classification tasks derived from a wide range of application domains, demonstrating the superiority of full KRR over inducing points KRR. Our work opens up the possibility of as-yet-unimagined applications of full KRR across a number of disciplines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.10070v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AlphaPEM: an open-source dynamic 1D physics-based PEM fuel cell model for embedded applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12373</link><description>arXiv:2407.12373v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Agents in partially observable environments require persistent memory to integrate observations over time. While KGs (knowledge graphs) provide a natural representation for such evolving state, existing benchmarks rarely expose agents to environments where both the world dynamics and the agent's memory are explicitly graph-shaped. We introduce the Room Environment v3, a configurable environment whose hidden state is an RDF KG and whose observations are RDF triples. The agent may extend these observations into a temporal KG when storing them in long-term memory. The environment is easily adjustable in terms of grid size, number of rooms, inner walls, and moving objects.
  We define a lightweight temporal KG memory for agents, based on RDF-star-style qualifiers (time_added, last_accessed, num_recalled), and evaluate several symbolic baselines that maintain and query this memory under different capacity constraints. Two neural sequence models (LSTM and Transformer) serve as contrasting baselines without explicit KG structure. Agents train on one layout and are evaluated on a held-out layout with the same dynamics but a different query order, exposing train-test generalization gaps. In this setting, temporal qualifiers lead to more stable performance, and the symbolic TKG (temporal knowledge graph) agent achieves roughly fourfold higher test QA (question-answer) accuracy than the neural baselines under the same environment and query conditions. The environment, agent implementations, and experimental scripts are released for reproducible research at https://github.com/humemai/agent-room-env-v3 and https://github.com/humemai/room-env.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.05861v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Task-Specific Directions: Definition, Exploration, and Utilization in Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01035</link><description>arXiv:2409.01035v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive performance on downstream tasks, yet they require extensive resource consumption when fully fine-tuning all parameters. To mitigate this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as LoRA, have been developed. In this paper, we delve into the concept of task-specific directions (TSDs), which are critical for transitioning large models from pretrained states to task-specific enhancements in PEFT. We propose a framework to clearly define these directions and explore their properties and practical utilization challenges. We then introduce a novel approach, LoRA-Dash, which aims to maximize the impact of TSDs during the fine-tuning process, thereby enhancing model performance on targeted tasks. Additionally, based on our exploration of TSD, we focus on an important issue in PEFT: the initialization of LoRA. While some works have pointed out the significance of initialization for LoRA's performance and proposed various strategies, these methods are often empirical and not task-specific. To address this issue, we propose LoRA-Init. Starting from TSD, we identify the directions that require the most adjustment during fine-tuning for downstream tasks. By initializing the matrices in LoRA with these directions, LoRA-Init significantly enhances LoRA's performance. Moreover, we can combine LoRA-Dash and LoRA-Init to create the final version of LoRA based on TSDs, which we refer to as LoRA-TSD. Extensive experiments have conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods, and in-depth analyses further reveal the underlying mechanisms behind their success.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.01035v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Online Convex Optimization for On-Board Routing in High-Throughput Satellites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01488</link><description>arXiv:2409.01488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Internet services has led to increasing demand, often exceeding available data rates and compromising the quality of service. While deploying more satellites offers a short-term fix, designing higher-performance satellites with enhanced transmission capabilities provides a more sustainable solution. Achieving the necessary high capacity requires interconnecting multiple modem banks within a satellite payload. However, there is a notable gap in research on internal packet routing within extremely high-throughput satellites. To address this, we propose a real-time optimal flow allocation and priority queue scheduling method using online convex optimization-based model predictive control. We model the problem as a multi-commodity flow instance and employ an online interior-point method to solve the routing and scheduling optimization iteratively. This approach minimizes packet loss and supports real-time rerouting with low computational overhead. Our method is tested in simulation on a next-generation extremely high-throughput satellite model, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to a reference batch optimization and to traditional methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.01488v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Joint Diffusion for Universal Hand-Object Grasp Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04560</link><description>arXiv:2409.04560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting and generating human hand grasp over objects is critical for animation and robotic tasks. In this work, we focus on generating both the hand and objects in a grasp by a single diffusion model. Our proposed Joint Hand-Object Diffusion (JHOD) models the hand and object in a unified latent representation. It uses the hand-object grasping data to learn to accommodate hand and object to form plausible grasps. Also, to enforce the generalizability over diverse object shapes, it leverages large-scale object datasets to learn an inclusive object latent embedding. With or without a given object as an optional condition, the diffusion model can generate grasps unconditionally or conditional to the object. Compared to the usual practice of learning object-conditioned grasp generation from only hand-object grasp data, our method benefits from more diverse object data used for training to handle grasp generation more universally. According to both qualitative and quantitative experiments, both conditional and unconditional generation of hand grasp achieves good visual plausibility and diversity. With the extra inclusiveness of object representation learned from large-scale object datasets, the proposed method generalizes well to unseen object shapes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.04560v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Token Caching for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18523</link><description>arXiv:2409.18523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers have gained substantial interest in diffusion generative modeling due to their outstanding performance. However, their computational demands, particularly the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms and multi-step inference processes, present substantial bottlenecks that limit their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose TokenCache, a novel acceleration method that leverages the token-based multi-block architecture of transformers to reduce redundant computations. TokenCache tackles three critical questions: (1) Which tokens should be pruned and reused by the caching mechanism to eliminate redundancy? (2) Which blocks should be targeted for efficient caching? (3) At which time steps should caching be applied to balance speed and quality? In response to these challenges, TokenCache introduces a Cache Predictor that hierarchically addresses these issues by (1) Token pruning: assigning importance scores to each token to determine which tokens to prune and reuse; (2) Block selection: allocating pruning ratio to each block to adaptively select blocks for caching; (3) Temporal Scheduling: deciding at which time steps to apply caching strategies. Experimental results across various models demonstrate that TokenCache achieves an effective trade-off between generation quality and inference speed for diffusion transformers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.18523v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pseudo-Nonlinear Data Augmentation: A Constrained Energy Minimization Viewpoint</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00718</link><description>arXiv:2410.00718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple yet novel data augmentation method for general data modalities based on energy-based modeling and principles from information geometry. Unlike most existing learning-based data augmentation methods, which rely on learning latent representations with generative models, our proposed framework enables an intuitive construction of a geometrically aware latent space that represents the structure of the data itself, supporting efficient and explicit encoding and decoding procedures. We then present and discuss how to design latent spaces that will subsequently control the augmentation with the proposed algorithm. Empirical results demonstrate that our data augmentation method achieves competitive performance in downstream tasks compared to other baselines, while offering fine-grained controllability that is lacking in the existing literature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.00718v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bayes Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search for Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11234</link><description>arXiv:2410.11234v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for data-driven decision-making and control. Compared to model-free methods, offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) explicitly learns world models from a static dataset and uses them as surrogate simulators, improving the data efficiency and enabling the learned policy to potentially generalize beyond the dataset support. However, there could be various MDPs that behave identically on the offline dataset and dealing with the uncertainty about the true MDP can be challenging. In this paper, we propose modeling offline MBRL as a Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP), which is a principled framework for addressing model uncertainty. We further propose a novel Bayes Adaptive Monte-Carlo planning algorithm capable of solving BAMDPs in continuous state and action spaces with stochastic transitions. This planning process is based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and can be integrated into offline MBRL as a policy improvement operator in policy iteration. Our "RL + Search" framework follows in the footsteps of superhuman AIs like AlphaZero, improving on current offline MBRL methods by incorporating more computation input. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on twelve D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three challenging, stochastic tokamak control tasks.

Abstract: The past years have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) strive not only as generative models but also as agents solving textual sequential decision-making tasks. When facing complex environments where their zero-shot abilities are insufficient, recent work showed online Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be used for the LLM agent to discover and learn efficient strategies interactively. However, most prior work sticks to on-policy algorithms, which greatly reduces the scope of methods such agents could use for both exploration and exploitation, such as experience replay and hindsight relabeling. Yet, such methods may be key for LLM learning agents, and in particular when designing autonomous intrinsically motivated agents sampling and pursuing their own goals (i.e. autotelic agents). This paper presents and studies an adaptation of Soft Actor-Critic and hindsight relabeling to LLM agents. Our method not only paves the path towards autotelic LLM agents that learn online but can also outperform on-policy methods in more classic multi-goal RL environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.12481v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CaTs and DAGs: Integrating Directed Acyclic Graphs with Transformers for Causally Constrained Predictions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14485</link><description>arXiv:2410.14485v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), including fully-connected networks and transformers, are highly flexible and powerful function approximators, widely applied in fields like computer vision and natural language processing. However, their inability to inherently respect causal structures can limit their robustness, making them vulnerable to covariate shift and difficult to interpret/explain. This poses significant challenges for their reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Causal Transformers (CaTs), a general model class designed to operate under predefined causal constraints, as specified by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). CaTs retain the powerful function approximation abilities of traditional neural networks while adhering to the underlying structural constraints, improving robustness, reliability, and interpretability at inference time. This approach opens new avenues for deploying neural networks in more demanding, real-world scenarios where robustness and explainability is critical.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.14485v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language Models are Symbolic Learners in Arithmetic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15580</link><description>arXiv:2410.15580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevailing question in LM performing arithmetic is whether these models learn to truly compute or if they simply master superficial pattern matching. In this paper, we argues for the latter, presenting evidence that LMs act as greedy symbolic learners, prioritizing the simplest possible shortcuts to fit the stats of dataset to solve arithmetic tasks. To investigate this, we introduce subgroup induction, a practical framework adapted from Solomonoff Induction (SI), one of the most powerful universal predictors. Our framework analyzes arithmetic problems by breaking them down into subgroups-minimal mappings between a few input digits and a single output digit. Our primary metric, subgroup quality, measures the viability of these shortcuts. Experiments reveal a distinct U-shaped accuracy pattern in multi-digit multiplication: LMs quickly master the first and last output digits while struggling with those in the middle. We demonstrate this U-shape is not coincidental; it perfectly mirrors the quality of the simplest possible subgroups, those requiring the fewest input tokens. This alignment suggests a core learning mechanism: LMs first learn easy, low-token shortcuts and only incorporate more complex, multi-token patterns as training progresses. They do not learn the algorithm of multiplication but rather a hierarchy of increasingly complex symbol-to-symbol mappings. Ultimately, our findings suggest that the path to arithmetic mastery for LMs is not paved with algorithms, but with a cascade of simple, hierarchically-learned symbolic shortcuts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.15580v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MobileSafetyBench: Evaluating Safety of Autonomous Agents in Mobile Device Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17520</link><description>arXiv:2410.17520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show promising potential in assistive tasks across various domains, including mobile device control. As these agents interact directly with personal information and device settings, ensuring their safe and reliable behavior is crucial to prevent undesirable outcomes. However, no benchmark exists for standardized evaluation of the safety of mobile device-control agents. In this work, we introduce MobileSafetyBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of device-control agents within a realistic mobile environment based on Android emulators. We develop a diverse set of tasks involving interactions with various mobile applications, including messaging and banking applications, challenging agents with managing risks encompassing misuse and negative side effects. These tasks include tests to evaluate the safety of agents in daily scenarios as well as their robustness against indirect prompt injection attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that baseline agents, based on state-of-the-art LLMs, often fail to effectively prevent harm while performing the tasks. To mitigate these safety concerns, we propose a prompting method that encourages agents to prioritize safety considerations. While this method shows promise in promoting safer behaviors, there is still considerable room for improvement to fully earn user trust. This highlights the urgent need for continued research to develop more robust safety mechanisms in mobile environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.17520v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive finite elements for obstacle problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22991</link><description>arXiv:2410.22991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We summarise three applications of the obstacle problem to membrane contact, elastoplastic torsion and cavitation modelling, and show how the resulting models can be solved using mixed finite elements.

Consequently, we demonstrate how $h$-adaptivity can be used to resolve the unknown coincidence set.

Abstract: Diffusion Models achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating new samples but lack a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the data into editable features. Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, transferring images to their approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image areas (e.g., plain sky). Through a series of analyses, we trace this issue to the first inversion steps, which fail to provide accurate and diverse noise. Consequently, the DDIM inversion space is notably less manipulative than the original noise. We show that prior inversion methods do not fully resolve this issue, but our simple fix, where we replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, successfully decorrelates latent encodings and enables higher quality editions and interpolations.

Abstract: Game UI development is essential to the game industry. However, the traditional workflow requires substantial manual effort to integrate pairwise UI and UX designs into a cohesive game user interface (GameUI). The inconsistency between the aesthetic UI design and the functional UX design typically results in mismatches and inefficiencies. To address the issue, we present an automatic system, AutoGameUI, for efficiently and accurately constructing GameUI. The system centers on a two-stage multimodal learning pipeline to obtain the optimal correspondences between UI and UX designs. The first stage learns the comprehensive representations of UI and UX designs from multimodal perspectives. The second stage incorporates grouped cross-attention modules with constrained integer programming to estimate the optimal correspondences through top-down hierarchical matching. The optimal correspondences enable the automatic GameUI construction. We create the GAMEUI dataset, comprising pairwise UI and UX designs from real-world games, to train and validate the proposed method. Besides, an interactive web tool is implemented to ensure high-fidelity effects and facilitate human-in-the-loop construction. Extensive experiments on the GAMEUI and RICO datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in maintaining consistency between the constructed GameUI and the original designs. When deployed in the workflow of several mobile games, AutoGameUI achieves a 3$\times$ improvement in time efficiency, conveying significant practical value for game UI development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.03709v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Problem Space Transformations for Out-of-Distribution Generalisation in Behavioural Cloning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04056</link><description>arXiv:2411.04056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of behavioural cloning and neural networks has driven significant progress in robotic manipulation. As these algorithms may require a large number of demonstrations for each task of interest, they remain fundamentally inefficient in complex scenarios, in which finite datasets can hardly cover the state space. One of the remaining challenges is thus out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation, i.e. the ability to predict correct actions for states with a low likelihood with respect to the state occupancy induced by the dataset. This issue is aggravated when the system to control is treated as a black-box, ignoring its physical properties. This work highlights widespread properties of robotic manipulation, specifically pose equivariance and locality. We investigate the effect of the choice of problem space on OOD performance of BC policies and how transformations arising from characteristic properties of manipulation can be employed for its improvement. Through controlled, simulated and real-world experiments, we empirically demonstrate that these transformations allow behaviour cloning policies, using either standard MLP-based one-step action prediction or diffusion-based action-sequence prediction, to generalise better to certain OOD problem instances.

Abstract: Contemporary large language model (LLM) training pipelines require the assembly of internet-scale databases full of text data from a variety of sources (e.g., web, academic, and publishers). Preprocessing these datasets via deduplication -- detecting and eliminating additional instances of the same content -- is a major focus for assembling and curating training datasets for LLMs. Unrestrained, duplicates in the training dataset increase training costs and lead to undesirable properties such as memorization in trained models or cheating on evaluation. Unfortunately, contemporary approaches to document-level deduplication are either unreliable at accurately identifying duplicate documents or extremely expensive in terms of both runtime and memory. We propose LSHBloom, an extension to MinhashLSH, which replaces the expensive LSHIndex with lightweight Bloom filters. LSHBloom demonstrates the same state-of-the-art deduplication performance as MinhashLSH, with only a marginal increase in false positives (near zero in our experiments), while boasting competitive runtime (12$\times$ faster than MinhashLSH on peS2o) and, crucially, using 18$\times$ less disk space than MinhashLSH (as measured on peS2o). Based on extrapolation, we show that this advantage in space and runtime remains even at the extreme scale of several billion documents. LSHBloom allows practitioners to access the deduplication quality of MinHashLSH at scales that are normally only tractable for less sophisticated, heuristic solutions. As a result, LSHBloom promises to enable scaling high-quality document deduplication to internet-scale text datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.04257v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoding Visual Experience and Mapping Semantics through Whole-Brain Analysis Using fMRI Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07121</link><description>arXiv:2411.07121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural decoding, the process of understanding how brain activity corresponds to different stimuli, has been a primary objective in cognitive sciences. Over the past three decades, advances in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and machine learning have greatly improved our ability to map visual stimuli to brain activity, especially in the visual cortex. Concurrently, research has expanded to decode more complex processes, such as language and memory across the whole brain, using techniques to handle greater variability and improve signal accuracy. We argue that "seeing" involves more than just mapping visual stimuli onto the visual cortex; it engages the entire brain, as various emotions and cognitive states can emerge from observing different scenes. In this paper, we develop algorithms to enhance our understanding of visual processes by incorporating whole-brain activation maps while individuals are exposed to visual stimuli. We utilize transformer-based large-scale fMRI encoders and Image generative models (encoders &amp; decoders) pre-trained on large public datasets, which are then fine-tuned through Image-fMRI contrastive learning. Our models can decode visual experience across the entire cerebral cortex, surpassing the traditional confines of the visual cortex. Using a public dataset (BOLD5000), we first compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches for decoding visual processing and show improved predictive semantic accuracy by 43%. A network ablation analysis suggests that, beyond the visual cortex, the default mode network contributes significantly to stimulus decoding, in line with the proposed role of this network in sense-making and semantic processing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.07121v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zer0-Jack: A Memory-efficient Gradient-based Jailbreaking Method for Black-box Multi-modal Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07559</link><description>arXiv:2411.07559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jailbreaking methods, which induce Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to output harmful responses, raise significant safety concerns. Among these methods, gradient-based approaches, which use gradients to generate malicious prompts, have been widely studied due to their high success rates in white-box settings, where full access to the model is available. However, these methods have notable limitations: they require white-box access, which is not always feasible, and involve high memory usage. To address scenarios where white-box access is unavailable, attackers often resort to transfer attacks. In transfer attacks, malicious inputs generated using white-box models are applied to black-box models, but this typically results in reduced attack performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Zer0-Jack, a method that bypasses the need for white-box access by leveraging zeroth-order optimization. We propose patch coordinate descent to efficiently generate malicious image inputs to directly attack black-box MLLMs, which significantly reduces memory usage further. Through extensive experiments, Zer0-Jack achieves a high attack success rate across various models, surpassing previous transfer-based methods and performing comparably with existing white-box jailbreak techniques. Notably, Zer0-Jack achieves a 95\% attack success rate on MiniGPT-4 with the Harmful Behaviors Multi-modal Dataset on a black-box setting, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, we show that Zer0-Jack can directly attack commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o.

Abstract: How can models effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in complex, multi-label settings without extensive retraining? Existing OOD detection methods struggle to capture the intricate semantic relationships and label co-occurrences inherent in multi-label settings, often requiring large amounts of training data and failing to generalize to unseen label combinations. While large language models have revolutionized zero-shot OOD detection, they primarily focus on single-label scenarios, leaving a critical gap in handling real-world tasks where samples can be associated with multiple interdependent labels. To address these challenges, we introduce COOD, a novel zero-shot multi-label OOD detection framework. COOD leverages pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing them with a concept-based label expansion strategy and a new scoring function. By enriching the semantic space with both positive and negative concepts for each label, our approach models complex label dependencies, precisely differentiating OOD samples without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving approximately 95% average AUROC on both VOC and COCO datasets, while maintaining robust performance across varying numbers of labels and different types of OOD samples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.13578v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Riemannian Take on Distance Fields and Geodesic Flows in Robotics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05197</link><description>arXiv:2412.05197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distance functions are crucial in robotics for representing spatial relationships between a robot and its environment. They provide an implicit, continuous, and differentiable representation that integrates seamlessly with control, optimization, and learning. While standard distance fields rely on the Euclidean metric, many robotic tasks inherently involve non-Euclidean structures. To this end, we generalize Euclidean distance fields to more general metric spaces by solving the Riemannian eikonal equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution defines a distance field and its associated gradient flow on the manifold, enabling the computation of geodesics and globally length-minimizing paths. We demonstrate that geodesic distance fields, the classical Riemannian distance function represented as a global, continuous, and queryable field, are effective for a broad class of robotic problems where Riemannian geometry naturally arises. To realize this, we present a neural Riemannian eikonal solver (NES) that solves the equation as a mesh-free implicit representation without grid discretization, scaling to high-dimensional robot manipulators. Training leverages a physics-informed neural network (PINN) objective that constrains spatial derivatives via the PDE residual and boundary and metric conditions, so the model is supervised by the governing equation and requires no labeled distances or geodesics. We propose two NES variants, conditioned on boundary data and on spatially varying Riemannian metrics, underscoring the flexibility of the neural parameterization. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive examples, yielding minimal-length geodesics across diverse robot tasks involving Riemannian geometry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.05197v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Descriptive Captions with Visual Attributes for Multimodal Perception</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14233</link><description>arXiv:2412.14233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training Large Multimodality Models (LMMs) relies on descriptive image caption that connects image and language. Existing methods for generating such captions often rely on distilling the captions from pretrained LMMs, constructing them from publicly available internet images, or even generating them through human annotation. However, these strategies can fall short in terms of precision and granularity, particularly when dealing with complex visual reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose to leverage off-the-shelf visual specialists, which were trained from annotated images initially not for image captioning, for enhancing the image caption. Our approach, named EDC, explores object low-level and fine-grained attributes (e.g., depth, emotion and fine-grained categories) and object relations (e.g., relative location and human-object-interaction (HOI)), and combine the attributes into the descriptive caption. By systematically integrating these rich attributes into the generated captions, EDC significantly improves the descriptive quality of the captions, providing a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the visual content. Experiments demonstrate that such visual specialists are able to improve the performance for visual understanding tasks as well as reasoning that benefits from more accurate visual understanding.

Abstract: We present a novel architecture aimed towards incremental construction and exploitation of a hierarchical 3D scene graph representation during semantic-aware inspection missions. Inspection planning, particularly of distributed targets in previously unseen environments, presents an opportunity to exploit the semantic structure of the scene during reasoning, navigation and scene understanding. Motivated by this, we propose the 3D Layered Semantic Graph (3DLSG), a hierarchical inspection scene graph constructed in an incremental manner and organized into abstraction layers that support planning demands in real-time. To address the task of semantic-aware inspection, a mission framework, termed as Enhanced First-Look Inspect Explore (xFLIE), that tightly couples the 3DLSG with an inspection planner is proposed. We assess the performance through simulations and experimental trials, evaluating target-selection, path-planning and semantic navigation tasks over the 3DLSG model. The scenarios presented are diverse, ranging from city-scale distributed to solitary infrastructure targets in simulated worlds and subsequent outdoor and subterranean environment deployments onboard a quadrupedal robot. The proposed method successfully demonstrates incremental construction and planning over the 3DLSG representation to meet the objectives of the missions. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates successful semantic navigation tasks over the structured interface at the end of the inspection missions. Finally, we report multiple orders of magnitude reduction in path-planning time compared to conventional volumetric-map-based methods over various environment scale, demonstrating the planning efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.19571v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deeply Learned Robust Matrix Completion for Large-scale Low-rank Data Recovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00677</link><description>arXiv:2501.00677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust matrix completion (RMC) is a widely used machine learning tool that simultaneously tackles two critical issues in low-rank data analysis: missing data entries and extreme outliers. This paper proposes a novel scalable and learnable non-convex approach, coined Learned Robust Matrix Completion (LRMC), for large-scale RMC problems. LRMC enjoys low computational complexity with linear convergence. Motivated by the proposed theorem, the free parameters of LRMC can be effectively learned via deep unfolding to achieve optimum performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a flexible feedforward-recurrent-mixed neural network framework that extends deep unfolding from fix-number iterations to infinite iterations. The superior empirical performance of LRMC is verified with extensive experiments against state-of-the-art on synthetic datasets and real applications, including video background subtraction, ultrasound imaging, face modeling, and cloud removal from satellite imagery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.00677v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PowerGraph-LLM: Novel Power Grid Graph Embedding and Optimization with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07639</link><description>arXiv:2501.07639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems in power systems is crucial for operational planning and grid management. There is a growing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling the increasing variability, constraints, and uncertainties in modern power networks while providing accurate and fast solutions. To address this, machine learning techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising approaches.

The proposed approach combines graph and tabular representations of power grids to effectively query LLMs, capturing the complex relationships and constraints in power systems. A new implementation of in-context learning and fine-tuning protocols for LLMs is introduced, tailored specifically for the OPF problem. PowerGraph-LLM demonstrates reliable performances using off-the-shelf LLM. Our study reveals the impact of LLM architecture, size, and fine-tuning and demonstrates our framework's ability to handle realistic grid components and constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.07639v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144</link><description>arXiv:2501.09144v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.09144v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Dynamic Representations via An Optimally-Weighted Maximum Mean Discrepancy Optimization Framework for Continual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12121</link><description>arXiv:2501.12121v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning has emerged as a pivotal area of research, primarily due to its advantageous characteristic that allows models to persistently acquire and retain information. However, catastrophic forgetting can severely impair model performance. In this study, we address network forgetting by introducing a novel framework termed Optimally-Weighted Maximum Mean Discrepancy (OWMMD), which imposes penalties on representation alterations via a Multi-Level Feature Matching Mechanism (MLFMM). Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Regularization Optimization (ARO) strategy to refine the adaptive weight vectors, which autonomously assess the significance of each feature layer throughout the optimization process, The proposed ARO approach can relieve the over-regularization problem and promote the future task learning. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, benchmarking our proposed method against several established baselines. The empirical findings indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.12121v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated Interpretability Metrics Do Not Distinguish Trained and Random Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17727</link><description>arXiv:2501.17727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used to extract sparse, interpretable latents from transformer activations. We test whether commonly used SAE quality metrics and automatic explanation pipelines can distinguish trained transformers from randomly initialized ones (e.g., where parameters are sampled i.i.d. from a Gaussian). Over a wide range of Pythia model sizes and multiple randomization schemes, we find that, in many settings, SAEs trained on randomly initialized transformers produce auto-interpretability scores and reconstruction metrics that are similar to those from trained models. These results show that high aggregate auto-interpretability scores do not, by themselves, guarantee that learned, computationally relevant features have been recovered. We therefore recommend treating common SAE metrics as useful but insufficient proxies for mechanistic interpretability and argue for routine randomized baselines and targeted measures of feature 'abstractness'.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.17727v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TableMaster: A Recipe to Advance Table Understanding with Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19378</link><description>arXiv:2501.19378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tables serve as a fundamental format for representing structured relational data. While current language models (LMs) excel at many text-based tasks, they still face challenges in table understanding due to the complex characteristics of tabular data, such as their structured nature. In this paper, we aim to enhance LMs for improved table understanding. We identify four key challenges: 1) difficulty in locating target data, 2) deficiency in table semantics, 3) numerical inaccuracies in textual reasoning, and 4) semantic inflexibility in symbolic reasoning. To address these issues, we propose TableMaster, a recipe and comprehensive framework that integrates multiple solutions to overcome these obstacles. TableMaster first extracts relevant table content and verbalizes it with enriched semantic context. Additionally, we introduce adaptive reasoning, a flexible approach that dynamically adjusts between textual and symbolic reasoning, tailoring the reasoning process to each query. Extensive analyses and experiments demonstrate our findings and the effectiveness of TableMaster. On the WikiTQ dataset, TableMaster achieves an accuracy of 78.13% using GPT-4o-mini, surpassing existing baselines. We hope this work will serve as a practical step toward more robust and reliable table understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.19378v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EmoBench-M: Benchmarking Emotional Intelligence for Multimodal Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04424</link><description>arXiv:2502.04424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the integration of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into robotic systems and various AI applications, embedding emotional intelligence (EI) capabilities into these models is essential for enabling robots to effectively address human emotional needs and interact seamlessly in real-world scenarios. Existing static, text-based, or text-image benchmarks overlook the multimodal complexities of real-world interactions and fail to capture the dynamic, multimodal nature of emotional expressions, making them inadequate for evaluating MLLMs' EI. Based on established psychological theories of EI, we build EmoBench-M, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the EI capability of MLLMs across 13 valuation scenarios from three key dimensions: foundational emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and socially complex emotion analysis. Evaluations of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs on EmoBench-M reveal a significant performance gap between them and humans, highlighting the need to further advance their EI capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models achieve state-of-the-art performance but are increasingly costly to fine-tune. Prompt tuning is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that addresses parameter-efficiency by learning prompt embeddings, but these embeddings are typically tied to the model's hidden dimensionality, limiting parameter saving. In this paper, we propose Ultra-Low-dimensional Prompt Tuning (ULPT), a simple yet effective method that optimizes prompts in a low-dimensional space (e.g., 2D) and uses a frozen random matrix for up-projection. ULPT can achieve 98% reduction in the training parameters compared to vanilla prompt tuning while preserving performance. Our extensive experiments across over 20 NLP tasks demonstrate that ULPT consistently outperforms recent parameter-efficient tuning methods using significantly fewer parameters, making it well-suited as a storage-efficient framework for massive LLM customization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.04501v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Languages: A Survey</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05568</link><description>arXiv:2502.05568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we systematically analyze techniques used to adapt large multimodal models (LMMs) for low-resource (LR) languages, examining approaches ranging from visual enhancement and data creation to cross-modal transfer and fusion strategies. Through a comprehensive analysis of 117 studies across 96 LR languages, we identify key patterns in how researchers tackle the challenges of limited data and computational resources. We categorize works into resource-oriented and method-oriented contributions, further dividing contributions into relevant sub-categories. We compare method-oriented contributions in terms of performance and efficiency, discussing benefits and limitations of representative studies. We find that visual information often serves as a crucial bridge for improving model performance in LR settings, though significant challenges remain in areas such as hallucination mitigation and computational efficiency. In summary, we provide researchers with a clear understanding of current approaches and remaining challenges in making LMMs more accessible to speakers of LR (understudied) languages.

Abstract: We derive a novel generative model from iterative Gaussian posterior inference.

In our experiments, we demonstrate that our model improves sample quality on ImageNet32 over both BFNs and the closely related Variational Diffusion Models, while achieving equivalent log-likelihoods on ImageNet32 and ImageNet64.

Abstract: Identifying subtle phenotypic variations in cellular images is critical for advancing biological research and accelerating drug discovery. These variations are often masked by the inherent cellular heterogeneity, making it challenging to distinguish differences between experimental conditions. Recent advancements in deep generative models have demonstrated significant potential for revealing these nuanced phenotypes through image translation, opening new frontiers in cellular and molecular biology as well as the identification of novel biomarkers. Among these generative models, diffusion models stand out for their ability to produce high-quality, realistic images. However, training diffusion models typically requires large datasets and substantial computational resources, both of which can be limited in biological research. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages pre-trained latent diffusion models to uncover subtle phenotypic changes. We validate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on several small datasets of microscopy images. Our findings reveal that our approach enables effective detection of phenotypic variations, capturing both visually apparent and imperceptible differences. Ultimately, our results highlight the promising potential of this approach for phenotype detection, especially in contexts constrained by limited data and computational capacity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.09665v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SWA-LDM: Toward Stealthy Watermarks for Latent Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10495</link><description>arXiv:2502.10495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have established themselves as powerful tools in the rapidly evolving field of image generation, capable of producing highly realistic images. However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns about copyright infringement and the misuse of generated content. Watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution, enabling copyright identification and misuse tracing through imperceptible markers embedded in generated images. Among these, latent-based watermarking techniques are particularly promising, as they embed watermarks directly into the latent noise without altering the underlying LDM architecture. In this work, we demonstrate that such latent-based watermarks are practically vulnerable to detection and compromise through systematic analysis of output images' statistical patterns for the first time. To counter this, we propose SWA-LDM (Stealthy Watermark for LDM), a lightweight framework that enhances stealth by dynamically randomizing the embedded watermarks using the Gaussian-distributed latent noise inherent to diffusion models. By embedding unique, pattern-free signatures per image, SWA-LDM eliminates detectable artifacts while preserving image quality and extraction robustness. Experiments demonstrate an average of 20% improvement in stealth over state-of-the-art methods, enabling secure deployment of watermarked generative AI in real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.10495v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Learning for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: A Channel Strategy Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10721</link><description>arXiv:2502.10721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) plays a crucial role across diverse fields, ranging from economic, energy, to traffic. In recent years, deep learning has demonstrated outstanding performance in MTSF tasks. In MTSF, modeling the correlations among different channels is critical, as leveraging information from other related channels can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of a specific channel. This study systematically reviews the channel modeling strategies for time series and proposes a taxonomy organized into three hierarchical levels: the strategy perspective, the mechanism perspective, and the characteristic perspective. On this basis, we provide a structured analysis of these methods and conduct an in-depth examination of the advantages and limitations of different channel strategies. Finally, we summarize and discuss some future research directions to provide useful research guidance.

Abstract: AI models, including both time-series-specific and general-purpose Foundation Models (FMs), have demonstrated strong potential in time-series forecasting across sectors like finance. However, these models are highly sensitive to input perturbations, which can lead to prediction errors and undermine trust among stakeholders, including investors and analysts. To address this challenge, we propose a causally grounded rating framework to systematically evaluate model robustness by analyzing statistical and confounding biases under various noisy and erroneous input scenarios. Our framework is applied to a large-scale experimental setup involving stock price data from multiple industries and evaluates both uni-modal and multi-modal models, including Vision Transformer-based (ViT) models and FMs. We introduce six types of input perturbations and twelve data distributions to assess model performance. Results indicate that multi-modal and time-series-specific FMs demonstrate greater robustness and accuracy compared to general-purpose models. Further, to validate our framework's usability, we conduct a user study showcasing time-series models' prediction errors along with our computed ratings. The study confirms that our ratings reduce the difficulty for users in comparing the robustness of different models. Our findings can help stakeholders understand model behaviors in terms of robustness and accuracy for better decision-making even without access to the model weights and training data, i.e., black-box settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.12226v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReVision: A Dataset and Baseline VLM for Privacy-Preserving Task-Oriented Visual Instruction Rewriting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14780</link><description>arXiv:2502.14780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and privacy-preserving multimodal interaction is essential as AR, VR, and modern smartphones with powerful cameras become primary interfaces for human-computer communication. Existing powerful large vision-language models (VLMs) enabling multimodal interaction often rely on cloud-based processing, raising significant concerns about (1) visual privacy by transmitting sensitive vision data to servers, and (2) their limited real-time, on-device usability. This paper explores Visual Instruction Rewriting, a novel approach that transforms multimodal instructions into text-only commands, allowing seamless integration of lightweight on-device instruction rewriter VLMs (250M parameters) with existing conversational AI systems, enhancing vision data privacy. To achieve this, we present a dataset of over 39,000 examples across 14 domains and develop a compact VLM, pretrained on image captioning datasets and fine-tuned for instruction rewriting. Experimental results, evaluated through NLG metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, along with semantic parsing analysis, demonstrate that even a quantized version of the model (&lt;500MB storage footprint) can achieve effective instruction rewriting, thus enabling privacy-focused, multimodal AI applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.14780v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human Cognitive Benchmarks Reveal Foundational Visual Gaps in MLLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16435</link><description>arXiv:2502.16435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans develop perception through a bottom-up hierarchy: from basic primitives and Gestalt principles to high-level semantics. In contrast, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are trained directly on complex downstream tasks, often bypassing these foundational visual capabilities. To systematically investigate this gap, we introduce VisFactor, a benchmark that digitizes 20 vision-centric subtests from FRCT, a well-established cognitive psychology assessment spanning four domains of human visual cognition. Furthermore, we design algorithms to automatically construct and validate unlimited test cases with controllable difficulty. Using VisFactor, we evaluate 23 frontier MLLMs, including both proprietary (e.g., GPT, Gemini) and open-source (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen) models. The best model achieves a score of only 30.17%. Models consistently fail on tasks such as mental rotation, spatial relation inference, and figure-ground discrimination, regardless of model size or prompting strategy. These findings suggest that performance improvements on existing general benchmarks might represent castles in the air instead of a genuine mastery of human-like visual cognition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.16435v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Value-based Process Verifier via Structural Prior Injection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17498</link><description>arXiv:2502.17498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Large Language Model(LLM) reasoning scenario, people often estimate state value via Monte Carlo sampling. Though Monte Carlo estimation is an elegant method with less inductive bias, noise and errors are inevitably introduced due to the limited sampling. To handle the problem, we inject the structural prior into the value representation and transfer the scalar value into the expectation of a pre-defined categorical distribution, representing the noise and errors from a distribution perspective. Specifically, by treating the result of Monte Carlo sampling as a single sample from the prior ground-truth Binomial distribution, we quantify the sampling error as the mismatch between posterior estimated distribution and ground-truth distribution, which is thus optimized via distribution selection optimization. We test the performance of value-based process verifiers on Best-of-N task and Beam search task. Compared with the scalar value representation, we show that reasonable structural prior injection induced by different objective functions or optimization methods can improve the performance of value-based process verifiers for about 1$\sim$2 points at little-to-no cost. We also show that under different structural prior, the verifiers' performances vary greatly despite having the same optimal solution, indicating the importance of reasonable structural prior injection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.17498v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Graph Learning Tasks with Pure LLMs: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Investigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18771</link><description>arXiv:2502.18771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising candidates for graph tasks. Many studies leverage natural language to describe graphs and apply LLMs for reasoning, yet most focus narrowly on performance benchmarks without fully comparing LLMs to graph learning models or exploring their broader potential. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of LLMs on graph learning tasks, evaluating both off-the-shelf and instruction-tuned models across a variety of scenarios. Beyond accuracy, we discuss data leakage concerns and computational overhead, and assess their performance under few-shot/zero-shot settings, domain transfer, structural understanding, and robustness. Our findings show that LLMs, particularly those with instruction tuning, greatly outperform traditional graph learning models in few-shot settings, exhibit strong domain transferability, and demonstrate excellent generalization and robustness. Our study highlights the broader capabilities of LLMs in graph learning and provides a foundation for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.18771v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Effect Estimation under Networked Interference without Networked Unconfoundedness Assumption</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19741</link><description>arXiv:2502.19741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects under networked interference from observational data is a crucial yet challenging problem. Most existing methods mainly rely on the networked unconfoundedness assumption, which guarantees the identification of networked effects. However, this assumption is often violated due to the latent confounders inherent in observational data, thereby hindering the identification of networked effects. To address this issue, we leverage the rich interaction patterns between units in networks, which provide valuable information for recovering these latent confounders. Building on this insight, we develop a confounder recovery framework that explicitly characterizes three categories of latent confounders in networked settings: those affecting only the unit, those affecting only the unit's neighbors, and those influencing both. Based on this framework, we design a networked effect estimator using identifiable representation learning techniques. From a theoretical standpoint, we prove the identifiability of all three types of latent confounders and, by leveraging the recovered confounders, establish a formal identification result for networked effects. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.19741v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Damper-B-PINN: Damper Characteristics-Based Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network for Vehicle State Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20772</link><description>arXiv:2502.20772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate state estimation is fundamental to intelligent vehicles. Wheel load, one of the most important chassis states, serves as an essential input for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and exerts a direct influence on vehicle stability and safety. However, wheel load estimation remains challenging due to the complexity of chassis modeling and the susceptibility of nonlinear systems to noise. To address these issues, this paper first introduces a refined suspension linkage-level modeling approach that constructs a nonlinear instantaneous dynamic model by explicitly considering the complex geometric structure of the suspension. Building upon this, we propose a damper characteristics-based Bayesian physics-informed neural network (Damper-B-PINN) framework to estimate dynamic wheel load, which leverages the suspension dynamics as physical guidance of PINN while employing Bayesian inference to mitigate the effects of system noise and uncertainty. Moreover, a damper-characteristic physics conditioning (DPC) module is designed for embedding physical prior. The proposed Damper-B-PINN is evaluated using both high-fidelity simulation datasets generated by CarSim software and real-world datasets collected from a Formula Student race car. Experimental results demonstrate that our Damper-B-PINN consistently outperforms existing methods across various test conditions, particularly extreme ones. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed Damper-B-PINN framework to enhance the accuracy and robustness of dynamic wheel load estimation, thereby improving the reliability and safety of ADAS applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.20772v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Automated Smart Contract Generation: Evaluation, Benchmarking, and Retrieval-Augmented Repair</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01098</link><description>arXiv:2503.01098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart contracts, predominantly written in Solidity and deployed on blockchains such as Ethereum, are immutable after deployment, making functional correctness critical. However, existing evaluations of Solidity code generation rely largely on surface-level metrics (e.g., BLEU, CrystalBLEU) or manual inspection, which correlate poorly with functional correctness. In contrast to Python, Solidity lacks large-scale, execution-based benchmarks, limiting systematic evaluation of large language models for smart contract development.
  We introduce SolBench, a comprehensive benchmark and automated testing pipeline for Solidity that emphasizes functional correctness via differential fuzzing. SolBench consists of 28825 functions extracted from 7604 real-world smart contracts collected from Etherscan (genesis-2024), spanning ten application domains. We benchmark 14 diverse LLMs, covering open and closed models, 1.3B-671B parameters, and both general-purpose and code-specialized architectures. The dominant failure mode is missing critical intra-contract information, such as state variables and type definitions. Providing full-contract context improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive inference costs.
  To address this, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Repair (RAR), a cost-effective framework that integrates execution feedback into code repair. RAR uses compiler and runtime error messages to retrieve only the minimal contract snippets needed to correct a target function, avoiding full-context inference. This significantly reduces input length while improving functional correctness. We further analyze retrieval and repair strategies within RAR, demonstrating consistent gains in accuracy and efficiency. SolBench and RAR enable principled, execution-based evaluation and economical improvement of Solidity code generation. Dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/ZaoyuChen/SolBench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.01098v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Promptware Engineering: Software Engineering for Prompt-Enabled Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02400</link><description>arXiv:2503.02400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software applications, giving rise to a broad class of prompt-enabled systems, in which prompts serve as the primary 'programming' interface for guiding system behavior. Building on this trend, a new software paradigm, promptware, has emerged, which treats natural language prompts as first-class software artifacts for interacting with LLMs. Unlike traditional software, which relies on formal programming languages and deterministic runtime environments, promptware is based on ambiguous, unstructured, and context-dependent natural language and operates on LLMs as runtime environments, which are probabilistic and non-deterministic. These fundamental differences introduce unique challenges in prompt development. In practice, prompt development remains largely ad hoc and relies heavily on time-consuming trial-and-error, a challenge we term the promptware crisis. To address this, we propose promptware engineering, a new methodology that adapts established Software Engineering (SE) principles to prompt development. Drawing on decades of success in traditional SE, we envision a systematic framework encompassing prompt requirements engineering, design, implementation, testing, debugging, evolution, deployment, and monitoring. Our framework re-contextualizes emerging prompt-related challenges within the SE lifecycle, providing principled guidance beyond ad-hoc practices. Without the SE discipline, prompt development is likely to remain mired in trial-and-error. This paper outlines a comprehensive roadmap for promptware engineering, identifying key research directions and offering actionable insights to advance the development of prompt-enabled systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.02400v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rewarding Doubt: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Calibrated Confidence Expression of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02623</link><description>arXiv:2503.02623v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A safe and trustworthy use of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires an accurate expression of confidence in their answers. We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning approach that allows to directly fine-tune LLMs to express calibrated confidence estimates alongside their answers to factual questions. Our method optimizes a reward based on the logarithmic scoring rule, explicitly penalizing both over- and under-confidence. This encourages the model to align its confidence estimates with the actual predictive accuracy. The optimal policy under our reward design would result in perfectly calibrated confidence expressions. Unlike prior approaches that decouple confidence estimation from response generation, our method integrates confidence calibration seamlessly into the generative process of the LLM. Empirically, we demonstrate that models trained with our approach exhibit substantially improved calibration and generalize to unseen tasks without further fine-tuning, suggesting the emergence of general confidence awareness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.02623v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding and Detecting Platform-Specific Violations in Android Auto Apps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04003</link><description>arXiv:2503.04003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite over 3.5 million Android apps and 200+ million Android Auto-compatible vehicles, only a few hundred apps support Android Auto due to platform-specific compliance requirements. Android Auto mandates service-based architectures in which the vehicle system invokes app callbacks to render the UI and handle interactions, which is fundamentally different from standard Activity-based Android development. Through an empirical study analysis of 98 issues across 14 Android Auto app repositories, we identified three major compliance failure categories: media playback errors, UI rendering issues, and voice command integration failures in line with mandatory requirements for integrating Android Auto support. We introduce AutoComply, a static analysis framework capable of detecting these compliance violations through the specialized analysis of platform-specific requirements. AutoComply constructs a Car-Control Flow Graph (CCFG) extending traditional control flow analysis to model the service-based architecture of Android Auto apps. Evaluating AutoComply on 31 large-scale open-source apps, it detected 27 violations (13X more than Android Lint), while no false positives were observed, achieving 2X faster analysis. Developers have acknowledged 14 of these violations with 8 fixes already implemented, validating AutoComply's practical effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.04003v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sample-Efficient Optimization over Generative Priors via Coarse Learnability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06917</link><description>arXiv:2503.06917v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In zeroth-order optimization, we seek to minimize a function $d(\cdot)$, which may encode combinatorial feasibility, using only function evaluations. We focus on the setting where solutions must also satisfy qualitative constraints or conform to a complex prior distribution. To address this, we introduce a new framework in which such constraints are represented by an initial generative prior $\L(\cdot)$, for example, a Large Language Model (LLM). The objective is to find solutions $s$ that minimize $d(s)$ while having high probability under $\L(s)$, effectively sampling from a target distribution proportional to $\L(s) \cdot e^{-T \cdot d(s)}$ for a temperature parameter $T$.
  While this framework aligns with classical Model-Based Optimization (e.g., the Cross-Entropy method), existing theory is ill-suited for deriving sample complexity bounds in black-box deep generative models. We therefore propose a novel learning assumption, which we term \emph{coarse learnability}, where an agent with access to a polynomial number of samples can learn a model whose point-wise density approximates the target within a polynomial factor. Leveraging this assumption, we design an iterative algorithm that employs a Metropolis-Hastings correction to provably approximate the target distribution using a polynomial number of samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works to establish such sample-complexity guarantees for model-based optimization with deep generative priors.
  We provide two lines of evidence supporting the coarse learnability assumption. Theoretically, we show that maximum likelihood estimation naturally induces the required coverage properties, holding for both standard exponential families and for misspecified models. Empirically, we demonstrate that LLMs can adapt their learned distributions to zeroth-order feedback to solve combinatorial optimization problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.06917v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating the Impact of Post-Training Quantization on Large Language Models for Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07103</link><description>arXiv:2503.07103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown an impressive capability in code generation. The LLM effectiveness generally increases with its size: The higher the number of LLM's trainable parameters the better its ability to implement code. However, when it comes to deploying LLM-based code generators, larger LLMs pose significant challenges related to their memory (and, consequently, carbon) footprint. A previous work by Wei et al. proposed to leverage quantization techniques to reduce the memory footprint of LLM-based code generators without substantially degrading their effectiveness. In short, they studied LLMs featuring up to 16B parameters, quantizing their precision from floating point 32 bits down to int 8 bits and showing their limited impact on code generation performance. Given the fast pace at which LLM capabilities and quantization techniques are evolving, in this work we present a differentiated replication of the work by Wei et al. in which we consider (i) on the one side, more recent and larger code-related LLMs, of up to 34B parameters; (ii) the latest advancements in model quantization techniques, which allow pushing the compression to the extreme quantization level of 2 bits per model parameter and; (iii) different types of calibration datasets to guide the quantization process, including code-specific ones. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the new frontier for LLM quantization is 4-bit precision, resulting in an average memory footprint reduction of 70% compared to the original model without observing any significant decrease in performance. Additionally, when the quantization becomes even more extreme (3 and 2 bits), a code-specific calibration dataset helps to limit the loss of performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.07103v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MIP against Agent: Malicious Image Patches Hijacking Multimodal OS Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10809</link><description>arXiv:2503.10809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in operating system (OS) agents have enabled vision-language models (VLMs) to directly control a user's computer. Unlike conventional VLMs that passively output text, OS agents autonomously perform computer-based tasks in response to a single user prompt. OS agents do so by capturing, parsing, and analysing screenshots and executing low-level actions via application programming interfaces (APIs), such as mouse clicks and keyboard inputs. This direct interaction with the OS significantly raises the stakes, as failures or manipulations can have immediate and tangible consequences. In this work, we uncover a novel attack vector against these OS agents: Malicious Image Patches (MIPs), adversarially perturbed screen regions that, when captured by an OS agent, induce it to perform harmful actions by exploiting specific APIs. For instance, a MIP can be embedded in a desktop wallpaper or shared on social media to cause an OS agent to exfiltrate sensitive user data. We show that MIPs generalise across user prompts and screen configurations, and that they can hijack multiple OS agents even during the execution of benign instructions. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in OS agents that have to be carefully addressed before their widespread deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.10809v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Panoramic Distortion-Aware Tokenization for Person Detection and Localization in Overhead Fisheye Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14228</link><description>arXiv:2503.14228v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Person detection in overhead fisheye images is challenging due to person rotation and small persons. Prior work has mainly addressed person rotation, leaving the small-person problem underexplored. We remap fisheye images to equirectangular panoramas to handle rotation and exploit panoramic geometry to handle small persons more effectively. Conventional detection methods tend to favor larger persons because they dominate the attention maps, causing smaller persons to be missed. In hemispherical equirectangular panoramas, we find that apparent person height decreases approximately linearly with the vertical angle near the top of the image. Using this finding, we introduce panoramic distortion-aware tokenization to enhance the detection of small persons. This tokenization procedure divides panoramic features using self-similar figures that enable the determination of optimal divisions without gaps, and we leverage the maximum significance values in each tile of the token groups to preserve the significance areas of smaller persons. We propose a transformer-based person detection and localization method that combines panoramic-image remapping and the tokenization procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms conventional methods on large-scale datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.14228v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Numerical stability revisited: A family of benchmark problems for the analysis of explicit stochastic differential equation integrators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19203</link><description>arXiv:2503.19203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the numerical stability of four well-established explicit stochastic integration schemes through a new generic benchmark stochastic differential equation (SDE) designed to assess asymptotic statistical accuracy and stability properties. This one-parameter benchmark equation is derived from a general one-dimensional first-order SDE using spatio-temporal nondimensionalization and is employed to evaluate the performance of (1) Euler-Maruyama (EM), (2) Milstein (Mil), (3) Stochastic Heun (SH), and (4) a three-stage Runge-Kutta scheme (RK3). Our findings reveal that lower-order schemes can outperform higher-order ones over a range of time step sizes, depending on the benchmark parameters and application context. The theoretical results are validated through a series of numerical experiments, and we discuss their implications for more general applications, including a nonlinear example of particle transport in porous media under various conditions. Our results suggest that the insights obtained from the linear benchmark problem provide reliable guidance for time-stepping strategies when simulating nonlinear SDEs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.19203v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Entropy-Gated Branching for Efficient Test-Time Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21961</link><description>arXiv:2503.21961v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Test-time compute methods can significantly improve the reasoning capabilities and problem-solving accuracy of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches require substantially more computational resources, with most compute wasted on exploring low-diversity branches where the model already exhibits high confidence. We observe that a small subset of uncertain reasoning steps has a disproportionately large impact on final prediction accuracy, and branching at these critical junctures tends to yield more diverse and higher-quality candidate reasoning steps. We propose Entropy-Gated Branching (EGB), which branches only at high-uncertainty steps and prunes expansions with a lightweight verifier. On mathematical and financial reasoning benchmarks, EGB improves accuracy by 22.6% over standard inference while operating 31%-75% faster across math benchmarks than test-time beam search with higher performance. Our results show that dynamic resource allocation during inference can substantially improve both efficiency and effectiveness, offering a more scalable pathway to enhanced LLM reasoning capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.21961v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Traffic Engineering in Large-scale Networks with Generalizable Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24203</link><description>arXiv:2503.24203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic Engineering (TE) in large-scale networks like cloud Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations is a critical challenge. Although learning-based approaches have been proposed to address the scalability of traditional TE algorithms, their practical application is often hindered by a lack of generalization, high training overhead, and a failure to respect link capacities. This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE problems efficiently in large-scale network scenarios, while achieving superior generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution" into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact underlying network topology or traffic patterns, and is able to very efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands. We train and evaluate TELGEN with random and real-world topologies, with networks of up to 5000 nodes and 3.6x10^6 links in testing. TELGEN shows less than 3% optimality gap while ensuring feasibility in all testing scenarios, even when the test network has 2-20x more nodes than the largest training network. It also saves up to 84% TE solving time than traditional interior-point method, and reduces up to 79.6% training time per epoch than the state-of-the-art learning-based algorithm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.24203v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PROPHET: An Inferable Future Forecasting Benchmark with Causal Intervened Likelihood Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01509</link><description>arXiv:2504.01509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting future events based on news on the Web stands as one of the ultimate aspirations of artificial intelligence. Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based systems have shown remarkable potential in forecasting future events, thereby garnering significant interest in the research community. Currently, several benchmarks have been established to evaluate the forecasting capabilities by formalizing the event prediction as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-and-reasoning task. In these benchmarks, each prediction question is answered with relevant retrieved news articles downloaded from the Web. However, because there is no consideration of whether the questions can be supported by valid or sufficient supporting rationales, some of the questions in these benchmarks may be inherently noninferable. To address this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, PROPHET, which comprises inferable forecasting questions paired with relevant news for retrieval. To ensure the inferability of the benchmark, we propose Causal Intervened Likelihood (CIL), a statistical measure that assesses inferability through causal inference. In constructing this benchmark, we first collected recent trend forecasting questions, and then filtered the data using CIL resulting in an inferable benchmark for future forecasting. Through extensive experiments, we first demonstrate the validity of CIL and in-depth investigations into future forecasting with the aid of CIL. Subsequently, we evaluate several representative prediction methods on PROPHET. The overall results draws valuable insights for task of future directions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.01509v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Flatness-Preserving Residuals for Pure-Feedback Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04324</link><description>arXiv:2504.04324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study residual dynamics learning for differentially flat systems, where a nominal model is augmented with a learned correction term from data. A key challenge is that generic residual parameterizations may destroy flatness, limiting the applicability of flatness-based planning and control methods. To address this, we propose a framework for learning flatness-preserving residual dynamics in systems whose nominal model admits a pure-feedback form. We show that residuals with a lower-triangular structure preserve both the flatness of the system and the original flat outputs. Moreover, we provide a constructive procedure to recover the flatness diffeomorphism of the augmented system from that of the nominal model. Building on these insights, we introduce a parameterization of flatness-preserving residuals using smooth function approximators, making them learnable from trajectory data with conventional algorithms. Our approach is validated in simulation on a 2D quadrotor subject to unmodeled aerodynamic effects. We demonstrate that the resulting learned flat model achieves a tracking error $5\times$ lower than the nominal flat model, while being $20\times$ faster over a structure-agnostic alternative.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.04324v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fine Tuning a Simulation-Driven Estimator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04480</link><description>arXiv:2504.04480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many industries now deploy high-fidelity simulators (digital twins) to represent physical systems, yet their parameters must be calibrated to match the true system. This motivated the construction of simulation-driven parameter estimators, built by generating synthetic observations for sampled parameter values and learning a supervised mapping from observations to parameters. However, when the true parameters lie outside the sampled range, predictions suffer from an out-of-distribution (OOD) error. This paper introduces a fine-tuning approach for the Two-Stage estimator that mitigates OOD effects and improves accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.04480v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uni-PrevPredMap: Extending PrevPredMap to a Unified Framework of Prior-Informed Modeling for Online Vectorized HD Map Construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06647</link><description>arXiv:2504.06647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety constitutes a foundational imperative for autonomous driving systems, necessitating maximal incorporation of accessible prior information. This study establishes that temporal perception buffers and cost-efficient high-definition (HD) maps inherently form complementary prior sources for online vectorized HD map construction. We present Uni-PrevPredMap, a pioneering unified framework systematically integrating previous predictions with corrupted HD maps. Our framework introduces a tri-mode paradigm maintaining operational consistency across non-prior, temporal-prior, and temporal-map-fusion modes. This tri-mode paradigm simultaneously decouples the framework from ideal map assumptions while ensuring robust performance in both map-present and map-absent scenarios. Additionally, we develop a tile-indexed 3D vectorized global map processor enabling efficient 3D prior data refreshment, compact storage, and real-time retrieval. Uni-PrevPredMap achieves state-of-the-art map-absent performance across established online vectorized HD map construction benchmarks. When provided with corrupted HD maps, it exhibits robust capabilities in error-resilient prior fusion, empirically confirming the synergistic complementarity between temporal predictions and imperfect map data.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems across various NLP benchmarks, their robustness in handling real-world user-LLM interaction queries remains largely underexplored. This presents a critical gap for practical deployment, where user queries exhibit greater linguistic variations and can trigger cascading errors across interdependent RAG components. In this work, we systematically analyze how varying four linguistic dimensions (formality, readability, politeness, and grammatical correctness) impact RAG performance. We evaluate two retrieval models and nine LLMs, ranging from 3 to 72 billion parameters, across four information-seeking Question Answering (QA) datasets. Our results reveal that linguistic reformulations significantly impact both retrieval and generation stages, leading to a relative performance drop of up to 40.41% in Recall@5 scores for less formal queries and 38.86% in answer match scores for queries containing grammatical errors. Notably, RAG systems exhibit greater sensitivity to such variations compared to LLM-only generations, highlighting their vulnerability to error propagation due to linguistic shifts. These findings highlight the need for improved robustness techniques to enhance reliability in diverse user interactions.

Abstract: AI applications increasingly run on fast-evolving, heterogeneous hardware to maximize performance, but general-purpose libraries lag in supporting these features. Performance-minded programmers often build custom communication stacks that are fast but error-prone and non-portable.
  This paper introduces MSCCL++, a design methodology for developing high-performance, portable communication kernels. It provides (1) a low-level, performance-preserving primitive interface that exposes minimal hardware abstractions while hiding the complexities of synchronization and consistency, (2) a higher-level DSL for application developers to implement workload-specific communication algorithms, and (3) a library of efficient algorithms implementing the standard collective API, enabling adoption by users with minimal expertise.
  Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, MSCCL++ achieves geomean speedups of $1.7\times$ (up to $5.4\times$) for collective communication and $1.2\times$ (up to $1.38\times$) for AI inference workloads. MSCCL++ is in production of multiple AI services provided by Microsoft Azure, and has also been adopted by RCCL, the GPU collective communication library maintained by AMD. MSCCL++ is open source and available at https://github.com/microsoft/mscclpp . Our two years of experience with MSCCL++ suggests that its abstractions are robust, enabling support for new hardware features, such as multimem, within weeks of development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.09014v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] R-Meshfusion: Reinforcement Learning Powered Sparse-View Mesh Reconstruction with Diffusion Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11946</link><description>arXiv:2504.11946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesh reconstruction from multi-view images is a fundamental problem in computer vision, but its performance degrades significantly under sparse-view conditions, especially in unseen regions where no ground-truth observations are available. While recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing novel views from limited inputs, their outputs often suffer from visual artifacts and lack 3D consistency, posing challenges for reliable mesh optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages diffusion models to enhance sparse-view mesh reconstruction in a principled and reliable manner. To address the instability of diffusion outputs, we propose a Consensus Diffusion Module that filters unreliable generations via interquartile range (IQR) analysis and performs variance-aware image fusion to produce robust pseudo-supervision. Building on this, we design an online reinforcement learning strategy based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to adaptively select the most informative viewpoints for enhancement, guided by diffusion loss. Finally, the fused images are used to jointly supervise a NeRF-based model alongside sparse-view ground truth, ensuring consistency across both geometry and appearance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in both geometric quality and rendering quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.11946v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Propaganda AI: An Analysis of Semantic Divergence in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12344</link><description>arXiv:2504.12344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit concept-conditioned semantic divergence: common high-level cues (e.g., ideologies, public figures) elicit unusually uniform, stance-like responses that evade token-trigger audits. This behavior falls in a blind spot of current safety evaluations, yet carries major societal stakes, as such concept cues can steer content exposure at scale. We formalize this phenomenon and present RAVEN (Response Anomaly Vigilance), a black-box audit that flags cases where a model is simultaneously highly certain and atypical among peers by coupling semantic entropy over paraphrastic samples with cross-model disagreement. In a controlled LoRA fine-tuning study, we implant a concept-conditioned stance using a small biased corpus, demonstrating feasibility without rare token triggers. Auditing five LLM families across twelve sensitive topics (360 prompts per model) and clustering via bidirectional entailment, RAVEN surfaces recurrent, model-specific divergences in 9/12 topics. Concept-level audits complement token-level defenses and provide a practical early-warning signal for release evaluation and post-deployment monitoring against propaganda-like influence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.12344v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Supervising 3D Talking Head Avatars with Analysis-by-Audio-Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13386</link><description>arXiv:2504.13386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to be widely applicable, speech-driven 3D head avatars must articulate their lips in accordance with speech, while also conveying the appropriate emotions with dynamically changing facial expressions. The key problem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without rich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but with lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic model with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on the following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it should be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred speech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create a novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate lip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under Neural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar framework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable sound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses audio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a diffusion-based talking avatar framework. During training, the mesh-to-speech model takes the generated animation and produces a sound that is compared to the input speech, creating a differentiable analysis-by-audio-synthesis supervision loop. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that THUNDER significantly improves the quality of the lip-sync of talking head avatars while still allowing for generation of diverse, high-quality, expressive facial animations.

Abstract: Tabular data sets with varying missing values are prepared for machine learning using an arbitrary imputation strategy. Synthetic values generated by imputation models often raise concerns regarding data quality and the reliability of data-driven outcomes. To address these concerns, this article proposes an imputation-free incremental attention learning (IFIAL) method for tabular data with missing values. A pair of attention masks is derived and retrofitted to a transformer to directly streamline tabular data without imputing or initializing missing values. The proposed method incrementally learns partitions of overlapping and fixed-size feature sets to enhance the performance of the transformer. The average classification performance rank order across 17 diverse tabular data sets highlights the superiority of IFIAL over 11 state-of-the-art learning methods with or without missing value imputations. Additional experiments corroborate the robustness of IFIAL to varying types and proportions of missing data, demonstrating its superiority over methods that rely on explicit imputations. A feature partition size equal to one-half the original feature space yields the best trade-off between computational efficiency and predictive performance. IFIAL is one of the first solutions that enables deep attention models to learn directly from tabular data, eliminating the need to impute missing values. %without the need for imputing missing values.

Abstract: Foundation models have garnered increasing attention for representation learning in remote sensing. Many such foundation models adopt approaches that have demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches for how to most effectively leverage remotely sensed data. This paper examines these approaches, along with their roots in the computer vision field. This is done to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls, while outlining future directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the need for massive compute resources. We first examine single-sensor remote foundation models to introduce concepts and provide context, and then place emphasis on incorporating the multi-sensor aspect of Earth observations into foundation models. In particular, we explore the extent to which existing approaches leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote sensing observations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.17177v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Sparse Frontier: Sparse Attention Trade-offs in Transformer LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17768</link><description>arXiv:2504.17768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse attention offers a promising strategy to extend long-context capabilities in Transformer LLMs, yet its efficiency-accuracy trade-offs remain unclear due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation. We address this gap with the largest-scale empirical analysis to date of training-free sparse attention, evaluating six methods across multiple model families and sizes, sequences up to 128K tokens, and sparsity levels up to 0.95 (i.e., $1/20$ attention budget) on nine diverse tasks. We first organise the rapidly evolving landscape of sparse attention methods into a taxonomy along four design axes. Our analysis then yields actionable insights: 1) sparse attention is effective -- larger sparse models outperform smaller dense ones at equivalent cost, improving the Pareto frontier; 2) due to computational constraints, token-to-page importance estimation is unfeasible during prefilling, where the choice of an alternative solution (global-to-token or block-to-block) depends on the task, but is possible during decoding, enabling better generalisation and tolerance to higher sparsity; 3) longer sequences tolerate higher sparsity, suggesting that fixed-budget methods in production are suboptimal. Together, these findings provide practical guidance for deploying sparse attention and methodological recommendations for future evaluations.

Abstract: Synthetic dataset generation in Computer Vision, particularly for industrial applications, is still underexplored. Industrial defect segmentation, for instance, requires highly accurate labels, yet acquiring such data is costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion-based pipeline for generating high-fidelity industrial datasets with minimal supervision. Our approach conditions the diffusion model on enriched bounding box representations to produce precise segmentation masks, ensuring realistic and accurately localized defect synthesis. Compared to existing layout-conditioned generative methods, our approach improves defect consistency and spatial accuracy. We introduce two quantitative metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our method and assess its impact on a downstream segmentation task trained on real and synthetic data. Our results demonstrate that diffusion-based synthesis can bridge the gap between artificial and real-world industrial data, fostering more reliable and cost-efficient segmentation models. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/covisionlab/diffusion_labeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.03623v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PYRREGULAR: A Unified Framework for Irregular Time Series, with Classification Benchmarks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06047</link><description>arXiv:2505.06047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Irregular temporal data, characterized by varying recording frequencies, differing observation durations, and missing values, presents significant challenges across fields like mobility, healthcare, and environmental science. Existing research communities often overlook or address these challenges in isolation, leading to fragmented tools and methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified framework, and the first standardized dataset repository for irregular time series classification, built on a common array format to enhance interoperability. This repository comprises 34 datasets on which we benchmark 12 classifier models from diverse domains and communities. This work aims to centralize research efforts and enable a more robust evaluation of irregular temporal data analysis methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.06047v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Does Neuro Mean to Cardio?

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce S-MedQA, an English medical question-answering (QA) dataset designed for benchmarking large language models (LLMs) in fine-grained clinical specialties. S-MedQA consists of over 24k examples, covering 15 medical specialties, with QA pairs that can have multiple specialty annotations, such as when a question is cross-disciplinary. The dataset is constructed using both machine and expert verification to maximize data availability and reliability. We use S-MedQA to investigate the role of clinical specialties in the knowledge-intensive scenario of medical QA. Our results show that training on data from a clinical specialty does not necessarily lead to the best performance on that specialty. Additionally, regardless of the specialty the LLM was fine-tuned on, token probabilities of clinically relevant terms consistently increase across all specialties. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that improvement gains, at least in our settings, are derived primarily from domain shifting (e.g., general to medical) rather than from injecting specialty-specific knowledge. This suggests a need to rethink the role of fine-tuning data in the medical domain. To encourage further advancements in the clinical NLP field, we release S-MedQA along with all the code required to reproduce our experiments for the research community.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.10113v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ForensicHub: A Unified Benchmark &amp; Codebase for All-Domain Fake Image Detection and Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11003</link><description>arXiv:2505.11003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of Fake Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) is highly fragmented, encompassing four domains: deepfake detection (Deepfake), image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL), artificial intelligence-generated image detection (AIGC), and document image manipulation localization (Doc). Although individual benchmarks exist in some domains, a unified benchmark for all domains in FIDL remains blank. The absence of a unified benchmark results in significant domain silos, where each domain independently constructs its datasets, models, and evaluation protocols without interoperability, preventing cross-domain comparisons and hindering the development of the entire FIDL field. To close the domain silo barrier, we propose ForensicHub, the first unified benchmark &amp; codebase for all-domain fake image detection and localization. Considering drastic variations on dataset, model, and evaluation configurations across all domains, as well as the scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and the lack of individual benchmarks in some domains, ForensicHub: i) proposes a modular and configuration-driven architecture that decomposes forensic pipelines into interchangeable components across datasets, transforms, models, and evaluators, allowing flexible composition across all domains; ii) fully implements 10 baseline models, 6 backbones, 2 new benchmarks for AIGC and Doc, and integrates 2 existing benchmarks of DeepfakeBench and IMDLBenCo through an adapter-based design; iii) conducts indepth analysis based on the ForensicHub, offering 8 key actionable insights into FIDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation standards. ForensicHub represents a significant leap forward in breaking the domain silos in the FIDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.11003v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CAMEO: Collection of Multilingual Emotional Speech Corpora</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11051</link><description>arXiv:2505.11051v3 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Isolation Forest (iForest) stands out as a widely-used unsupervised anomaly detector, primarily owing to its remarkable runtime efficiency and superior performance in large-scale tasks. Despite its widespread adoption, a theoretical foundation explaining iForest's success remains unclear. This paper focuses on the inductive bias of iForest, which theoretically elucidates under what circumstances and to what extent iForest works well. The key is to formulate the growth process of iForest, where the split dimensions and split values are randomly selected. We model the growth process of iForest as a random walk, enabling us to derive the expected depth function, which is the outcome of iForest, using transition probabilities. The case studies reveal key inductive biases: iForest exhibits lower sensitivity to central anomalies while demonstrating greater parameter adaptability compared to $k$-Nearest Neighbor. Our study provides a theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of iForest and establishes a foundation for further theoretical exploration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.12825v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PIM-malloc: A Fast and Scalable Dynamic Memory Allocator for Processing-In-Memory (PIM) Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13002</link><description>arXiv:2505.13002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to dynamically allocate memory is fundamental in modern programming languages. However, this feature is not adequately supported in current general-purpose PIM devices. To identify key design principles that PIM must consider, we conduct a design space exploration of PIM memory allocators, examining various strategies for metadata placement and management of the allocator. Based on this exploration, we introduce PIM-malloc, a fast and scalable memory allocator for general-purpose PIM that operates on real PIM hardware, achieving a x66 improvement in memory allocation performance. This design is further enhanced with a lightweight, per-PIM core hardware cache, specifically designed for dynamic memory allocation, achieving an additional 31% performance improvement. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of PIM-malloc by developing several representative PIM workloads, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing programmability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.13002v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RL of Thoughts: Navigating LLM Reasoning with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14140</link><description>arXiv:2505.14140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), the token-level autoregressive nature constrains their complex reasoning capabilities. To enhance LLM reasoning, inference-time techniques, including Chain/Tree/Graph-of-Thought(s), successfully improve the performance, as they are fairly cost-effective by guiding reasoning through sophisticated logical structures without modifying LLMs' parameters. However, these manually predefined, task-agnostic frameworks are applied uniformly across diverse tasks, lacking adaptability. To improve this, we propose RL-of-Thoughts (RLoT), where we train a lightweight navigator model with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance LLM reasoning at inference time. Specifically, we design five basic logic blocks from the perspective of human cognition. During the reasoning process, the trained RL navigator dynamically selects the suitable logic blocks and combines them into task-specific logical structures according to problem characteristics. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH, GPQA, etc.) with multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek) illustrate that RLoT outperforms established inference-time techniques by up to 13.4%. Remarkably, with less than 3K parameters, our RL navigator is able to make sub-10B LLMs comparable to 100B-scale counterparts. Moreover, the RL navigator demonstrates strong transferability: a model trained on one specific LLM-task pair can effectively generalize to unseen LLMs and tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in privacy pipelines to detect and remedy sensitive data leakage. These solutions often rely on the premise that LLMs can reliably recognize human names, one of the most important categories of personally identifiable information (PII). In this paper, we reveal how LLMs can consistently mishandle broad classes of human names even in short text snippets due to ambiguous linguistic cues in the contexts. We construct AmBench, a benchmark of over 12,000 real yet ambiguous human names based on the name regularity bias phenomenon. Each name appears in dozens of concise text snippets that are compatible with multiple entity types. Our experiments with 12 state-of-the-art LLMs show that the recall of AmBench names drops by 20--40% compared to more recognizable names. This uneven privacy protection due to linguistic properties raises important concerns about the fairness of privacy enforcement. When the contexts contain benign prompt injections -- instruction-like user texts that can cause LLMs to conflate data with commands -- AmBench names can become four times more likely to be ignored in Clio, an LLM-powered enterprise tool used by Anthropic AI to extract supposedly privacy-preserving insights from user conversations with Claude. Our findings showcase blind spots in the performance and fairness of LLM-based privacy solutions and call for a systematic investigation into their privacy failure modes and countermeasures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.14549v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARMS: A Vision for Actor Reputation Metric Systems in the Open-Source Software Supply Chain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18760</link><description>arXiv:2505.18760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many critical information technology and cyber-physical systems rely on a supply chain of open-source software projects. OSS project maintainers often integrate contributions from external actors. While maintainers can assess the correctness of a pull request, assessing a pull request's cybersecurity implications is challenging. To help maintainers make this decision, we propose that the open-source ecosystem should incorporate Actor Reputation Metrics (ARMS). This capability would enable OSS maintainers to assess a prospective contributor's cybersecurity reputation. To support the future instantiation of ARMS, we identify seven generic security signals from industry standards; map concrete metrics from prior work and available security tools, describe study designs to refine and assess the utility of ARMS, and finally weigh its pros and cons.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.18760v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SIPDO: Closed-Loop Prompt Optimization via Synthetic Data Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19514</link><description>arXiv:2505.19514v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.19514v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving LLM-based Global Optimization with Search Space Partitioning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21372</link><description>arXiv:2505.21372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as effective surrogate models and candidate generators within global optimization frameworks for expensive blackbox functions. Despite promising results, LLM-based methods often struggle in high-dimensional search spaces or when lacking domain-specific priors, leading to sparse or uninformative suggestions. To overcome these limitations, we propose HOLLM, a novel global optimization algorithm that enhances LLM-driven sampling by partitioning the search space into promising subregions. Each subregion acts as a ``meta-arm'' selected via a bandit-inspired scoring mechanism that effectively balances exploration and exploitation. Within each selected subregion, an LLM then proposes high-quality candidate points, without any explicit domain knowledge. Empirical evaluation on standard optimization benchmarks shows that HOLLM consistently matches or surpasses leading global optimization methods, while substantially outperforming global LLM-based sampling strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.21372v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Text2Grad: Reinforcement Learning from Natural Language Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22338</link><description>arXiv:2505.22338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that mask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and opaque learning. Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through prompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model parameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm that turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human (or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the relevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward signals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending portions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned adjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three components: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs critiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts span-level reward on answers while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a span-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients. Across summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad consistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing both higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results suggest that natural-language feedback can serve not only as explanations, but also as actionable training signals for fine-grained alignment. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/microsoft/Text2Grad.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.22338v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Meaning Is Not A Metric: Using LLMs to make cultural context legible at scale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23785</link><description>arXiv:2505.23785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs) can make cultural context, and therefore human meaning, legible at an unprecedented scale in AI-based sociotechnical systems. We argue that such systems have previously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin descriptions (numerical representations that enforce standardization and therefore strip human activity of the cultural context which gives it meaning). By contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have developed frameworks for representing meaning through thick description (verbal representations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual information needed to represent human meaning). The verbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of at least partially automating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, offering new ways to deploy them at scale. We argue that the problem of rendering human meaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics but about developing new representational formats based on thick description. We frame this as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify five key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism, integrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance, distinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and acknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.23785v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MoRA: Mobility as the Backbone for Geospatial Representation Learning at Scale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01297</link><description>arXiv:2506.01297v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representation learning of geospatial locations remains a core challenge in achieving general geospatial intelligence, with increasingly diverging philosophies and techniques. While Earth observation paradigms excel at depicting locations in their physical states, we claim that a location's comprehensive "meaning" is better grounded in its internal human activity patterns and, crucially, its functional relationships with other locations, as revealed by human movement. We present MoRA, a human-centric geospatial framework that leverages a mobility graph as its core backbone to fuse various data modalities, aiming to learn embeddings that represent the socio-economic context and functional role of a location. MoRA achieves this through the integration of spatial tokenization, GNNs, and asymmetric contrastive learning to align 100M+ POIs, massive remote sensing imagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility graph, ensuring the three auxiliary modalities are interpreted through the lens of fundamental human dynamics. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of MoRA, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 9 downstream prediction tasks across social and economic domains. Experiments show that MoRA, with four input modalities and a compact 128-dimensional representation space, achieves superior predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an average of 12.9%. Echoing LLM scaling laws, we further demonstrate the scaling behavior in geospatial representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models shows promise for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex manipulation. This limitation arises from entangled features in overlapping regions, leading to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics via a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction, and models each phase using the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction. This design effectively alleviates the multi-object feature fusion issue in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency across the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge dataset, as well as RLBench and SIMPLER benchmarks, demonstrate that our method establishs new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies has driven organizations across diverse sectors to seek efficient and reliable methods to accelerate model development-to-deployment. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as an integrative approach addressing these requirements by unifying relevant roles and streamlining ML workflows. As the MLOps market continues to grow, securing these pipelines has become increasingly critical. However, the unified nature of MLOps ecosystem introduces vulnerabilities, making them susceptible to adversarial attacks where a single misconfiguration can lead to compromised credentials, severe financial losses, damaged public trust, and the poisoning of training data. Our paper presents a systematic application of the MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) framework, supplemented by reviews of white and grey literature, to systematically assess attacks across different phases of the MLOps ecosystem. We begin by reviewing prior work in this domain, then present our taxonomy and introduce a threat model that captures attackers with different knowledge and capabilities. We then present a structured taxonomy of attack techniques explicitly mapped to corresponding phases of the MLOps ecosystem, supported by examples drawn from red-teaming exercises and real-world incidents. This is followed by a taxonomy of mitigation strategies aligned with these attack categories, offering actionable early-stage defenses to strengthen the security of MLOps ecosystem. Given the gradual evolution and adoption of MLOps, we further highlight key research gaps that require immediate attention. Our work emphasizes the importance of implementing robust security protocols from the outset, empowering practitioners to safeguard MLOps ecosystem against evolving cyber attacks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.02032v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Risk-Sensitive Agent Compositions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04632</link><description>arXiv:2506.04632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized AI agents to complete them. We formalize agentic workflows as directed acyclic graphs, called agent graphs, where edges represent AI agents and paths correspond to feasible compositions of agents. Real-world deployment requires selecting agent compositions that not only maximize task success but also minimize violations of safety, fairness, and privacy requirements which demands a careful analysis of the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In this work, we consider risk minimization over the set of feasible agent compositions and seek to minimize the value-at-risk and the conditional value-at-risk of the loss distribution of the agent composition where the loss quantifies violations of these requirements. We introduce an efficient algorithm which traverses the agent graph and finds a near-optimal composition of agents. It uses a dynamic programming approach to approximate the value-at-risk of agent compositions by exploiting a union bound. Furthermore, we prove that the approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical loss functions. We also show how our algorithm can be used to approximate the conditional value-at-risk as a byproduct. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04632v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improved Regret Bounds for Linear Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04775</link><description>arXiv:2506.04775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by $\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a $\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound. This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$. We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04775v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NIMO: a Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05059</link><description>arXiv:2506.05059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across many domains, but it has also created a growing demand for interpretability in model predictions. Although many explainable machine learning methods have been proposed, post-hoc explanations lack guaranteed fidelity and are sensitive to hyperparameter choices, highlighting the appeal of inherently interpretable models. For example, linear regression provides clear feature effects through its coefficients. However, such models are often outperformed by more complex neural networks (NNs) that usually lack inherent interpretability. To address this dilemma, we introduce NIMO, a framework that combines inherent interpretability with the expressive power of neural networks. Building on the simple linear regression, NIMO is able to provide flexible and intelligible feature effects. Relevantly, we develop an optimization method based on parameter elimination, that allows for optimizing the NN parameters and linear coefficients effectively and efficiently. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate sparsity as well. We show empirically that our model can provide faithful and intelligible feature effects while maintaining good predictive performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.05059v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MLVTG: Mamba-Based Feature Alignment and LLM-Driven Purification for Multi-Modal Video Temporal Grounding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08512</link><description>arXiv:2506.08512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.08512v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised Elicitation of Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10139</link><description>arXiv:2506.10139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However, for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden labels and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally, we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to train a Claude 4 Sonnet-based assistant. The resulting assistant matches its counterpart trained on production-grade human labels on average, with higher scores on chat and safety yet lower scores on math and coding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10139v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privacy Reasoning in Ambiguous Contexts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12241</link><description>arXiv:2506.12241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ability of language models to reason about appropriate information disclosure - a central aspect of the evolving field of agentic privacy. Whereas previous works have focused on evaluating a model's ability to align with human decisions, we examine the role of ambiguity and missing context on model performance when making information-sharing decisions. We identify context ambiguity as a crucial barrier for high performance in privacy assessments. By designing Camber, a framework for context disambiguation, we show that model-generated decision rationales can reveal ambiguities and that systematically disambiguating context based on these rationales leads to significant accuracy improvements (up to 13.3% in precision and up to 22.3% in recall) as well as reductions in prompt sensitivity. Overall, our results indicate that approaches for context disambiguation are a promising way forward to enhance agentic privacy reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.12241v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probing Deep into Temporal Profile Makes the Infrared Small Target Detector Much Better</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12766</link><description>arXiv:2506.12766v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared small target (IRST) detection is challenging in simultaneously achieving precise, robust, and efficient performance due to extremely dim targets and strong interference. Current learning-based methods attempt to leverage ``more" information from both the spatial and the short-term temporal domains, but suffer from unreliable performance under complex conditions while incurring computational redundancy. In this paper, we explore the ``more essential" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and correlation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant superiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate whether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks, we built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the importance of the temporal profile information. Inspired by the above conclusions, we remodel the IRST detection task as a one-dimensional signal anomaly detection task, and propose an efficient deep temporal probe network (DeepPro) that only performs calculations in the time dimension for IRST detection. We conducted extensive experiments to fully validate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results are exciting, as our DeepPro outperforms existing state-of-the-art IRST detection methods on widely-used benchmarks with extremely high efficiency, and achieves a significant improvement on dim targets and in complex scenarios. We provide a new modeling domain, a new insight, a new method, and a new performance, which can promote the development of IRST detection.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.13474v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Plan Caching: Test-Time Memory for Fast and Cost-Efficient LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14852</link><description>arXiv:2506.14852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based agent applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs and latency due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agent applications where outputs depend on external data and environmental contexts. We propose Agentic Plan Caching (APC), a novel test-time memory that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agent applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost and latency of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agent applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 50.31% and latency by 27.28% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.14852v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient B-Spline Finite Elements for Cloth Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18867</link><description>arXiv:2506.18867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient B-spline finite element method (FEM) for cloth simulation. While higher-order FEM has long promised higher accuracy, its adoption in cloth simulators has been limited by its larger computational costs while generating results with similar visual quality. Our contribution is a full algorithmic pipeline that makes cloth simulation using quadratic B-spline surfaces faster than standard linear FEM in practice while consistently improving accuracy and visual fidelity. Using quadratic B-spline basis functions, we obtain a globally $C^1$-continuous displacement field that supports consistent discretization of both membrane and bending energies, effectively reducing locking artifacts and mesh dependence common to linear elements. To close the performance gap, we introduce a reduced integration scheme that separately optimizes quadrature rules for membrane and bending energies, an accelerated Hessian assembly procedure tailored to the spline structure, and an optimized linear solver based on partial factorization. Together, these optimizations make high-order, smooth cloth simulation competitive at scale, yielding an average $2\times$ speedup over highly-optimized linear FEM in our tests. Extensive experiments demonstrate improved accuracy, wrinkle detail, and robustness, including contact-rich scenarios, relative to linear FEM and recent higher-order approaches. Our method enables realistic wrinkling dynamics across a wide range of material parameters and supports practical garment animation, providing a new promising spatial discretization for high-quality cloth simulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.18867v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DPLib: A Standard Benchmark Library for Distributed Power System Analysis and Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20819</link><description>arXiv:2506.20819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \textit{DPLib} is an open-source MATLAB-based benchmark library created to support research and development in distributed and decentralized power system analysis and optimization. Distributed and decentralized methods offer scalability, privacy preservation, and resilience to single points of failure, making them increasingly important for modern power systems. However, unlike centralized tools such as MATPOWER, no general-purpose, reproducible data library package currently exists for distributed power system studies. DPLib, available at \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/DPLib.git}{GitHub}, fills this gap by providing a standard power system library featuring over 20 multi-region benchmark test cases of varying sizes, along with a graph-based partitioning toolkit that decomposes any MATPOWER test system into multiple electrically coherent regions. The partitioning toolkit, an easy-to-use MATLAB code, generates standardized \texttt{.mat} and \texttt{.m} files, along with region visualizations for intuitive understanding. We also provide modular, easy-to-use distributed optimal power flow (OPF) solvers: an alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM)-based DC-OPF solver implemented in YALMIP, and an ADMM-based AC-OPF solver leveraging IPOPT. These solvers validate the generated test systems for distributed optimization applications. Numerical results validate the generated test cases, establishing DPLib as a foundation for reproducible distributed power system research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.20819v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SABRE-FL: Selective and Accurate Backdoor Rejection for Federated Prompt Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22506</link><description>arXiv:2506.22506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning has emerged as a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving paradigm for adapting large vision-language models like CLIP across decentralized clients. However, the security implications of this setup remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first study of backdoor attacks in Federated Prompt Learning. We show that when malicious clients inject visually imperceptible, learnable noise triggers into input images, the global prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while still maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this vulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters poisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained offline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client data or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that malicious clients can be reliably identified and filtered using an embedding-based detector. Across five diverse datasets and four baseline defenses, SABRE-FL outperforms all baselines by significantly reducing backdoor accuracy while preserving clean accuracy, demonstrating strong empirical performance and underscoring the need for robust prompt learning in future federated systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.22506v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Z Transform Laplace Inversion: To Correct flaws in Signal and System Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23242</link><description>arXiv:2506.23242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the classical formulation of the Z-transform and its relationship to the inverse Laplace transform (L-1), originally developed by Ragazzini in sampled-data theory. It identifies a longstanding mathematical oversight in standard derivations, which typically neglect the contribution from the infinite arc in the complex plane during inverse Laplace evaluation. This omission leads to inconsistencies, especially at discontinuities such as t = 0. By incorporating the full Bromwich contour, including all boundary contributions, we restore internal consistency between L-1 and the Z-transform, aligning the corrected L-1 with results from Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) aliasing theory. Consequently, this necessitates a structural revision of the Z-transform, inverse Laplace transform, and the behavior of the Heaviside step function at discontinuities, providing a more accurate foundation for modeling and analysis of sampled-data systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.23242v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BugLens: Leveraging Bisection for Lightweight Compiler Bug Deduplication</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23281</link><description>arXiv:2506.23281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random testing has proven to be an effective technique for compiler validation. However, the debugging of bugs identified through random testing presents a significant challenge due to the frequent occurrence of duplicate test programs that expose identical compiler bugs. The process to identify duplicates is a practical research problem known as bug deduplication. Prior methodologies for compiler bug deduplication primarily rely on program analysis to extract bug-related features for duplicate identification, which can result in substantial computational overhead and limited generalizability. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing bisection, a standard debugging procedure largely overlooked in prior research on compiler bug deduplication, for this purpose. Our study demonstrates that the utilization of bisection to locate failure-inducing commits provides a valuable criterion for deduplication, albeit one that requires supplementary techniques for more accurate identification. Building on these results, we introduce BugLens, a novel deduplication method that primarily uses bisection, enhanced by the identification of bug-triggering optimizations to minimize false negatives. Empirical evaluations conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that BugLens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art analysis-based methodologies Tamer and D3 by saving an average of 26.98% and 9.64% human effort to identify the same number of distinct bugs. Given the inherent simplicity and generalizability of bisection, it presents a highly practical solution for compiler bug deduplication in real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.23281v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Minimal residual rational Krylov subspace method for sequences of shifted linear systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00267</link><description>arXiv:2507.00267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solution of sequences of shifted linear systems is a classic problem in numerical linear algebra, and a variety of efficient methods have been proposed over the years. Nevertheless, there still exist challenging scenarios witnessing a lack of performing solvers. For instance, state-of-the-art procedures struggle to handle nonsymmetric problems where the shifts are complex numbers that do not come as conjugate pairs. We design a novel projection strategy based on the rational Krylov subspace equipped with a minimal residual condition. We also devise a novel pole selection procedure, tailored to our problem, providing poles for the rational Krylov basis construction that yield faster convergence than those computed by available general-purpose schemes. A panel of diverse numerical experiments shows that our novel approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques, especially on the very challenging problems mentioned above.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.00267v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Gift from the Integration of Discriminative and Diffusion-based Generative Learning: Boundary Refinement Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01573</link><description>arXiv:2507.01573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently, segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information). However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning, which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement (IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results from diverse discriminative architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.01573v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-Layer Attention Pruning with Rescaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01900</link><description>arXiv:2507.01900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers, without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27 datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: Self-improvement via RL often fails on complex reasoning tasks because GRPO-style post-training methods rely on the model's initial ability to generate positive samples. Without guided exploration, these approaches merely reinforce what the model already knows (distribution-sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems where it initially generates no correct solutions. To unlock reasoning ability in such settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training. Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the ground-truth answer. It can be integrated with popular RL training methods like GRPO and DPO. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples. Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially struggles the most.

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes. However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution, compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Toward a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator. Overall, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.07981v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BootSeer: Analyzing and Mitigating Initialization Bottlenecks in Large-Scale LLM Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12619</link><description>arXiv:2507.12619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large, industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a) container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and (c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in startup overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.12619v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GOFAI meets Generative AI: Development of Expert Systems by means of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13550</link><description>arXiv:2507.13550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet, those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts. This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications in sensitive domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.13550v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Noradrenergic-inspired gain modulation attenuates the stability gap in joint training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14056</link><description>arXiv:2507.14056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the stability gap -- a temporary performance drop on previously learned tasks when new ones are introduced. This phenomenon reflects a mismatch between rapid adaptation and strong retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need for optimization mechanisms that balance plasticity and stability over abrupt distribution changes. While optimizers such as momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit multi-timescale behavior, they still exhibit pronounced stability gaps. Importantly, these gaps persist even under ideal joint training, making it crucial to study them in this setting to isolate their causes from other sources of forgetting. Motivated by how noradrenergic (neuromodulatory) bursts transiently increase neuronal gain under uncertainty, we introduce a dynamic gain scaling mechanism as a two-timescale optimization technique that balances adaptation and retention by modulating effective learning rates and flattening the local landscape through an effective reparameterization. Across domain- and class-incremental MNIST, CIFAR, and mini-ImageNet benchmarks under task-agnostic joint training, dynamic gain scaling effectively attenuates stability gaps while maintaining competitive accuracy, improving robustness at task transitions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.14056v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion models for multivariate subsurface generation and efficient probabilistic inversion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15809</link><description>arXiv:2507.15809v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.15809v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepSieve: Information Sieving via LLM-as-a-Knowledge-Router</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22050</link><description>arXiv:2507.22050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity, transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability over conventional RAG approaches.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships. However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems, autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation (PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently delivering performance improvements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.23581v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging Convolutional and Graph Networks for an Unsupervised Remote Sensing Labelling Tool</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00506</link><description>arXiv:2508.00506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work, we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be formed within the encoding space. Our pipeline achieves high contextual consistency, with similarity scores of SSIM = 0.96 and SAM = 0.21 under context-aware evaluation, demonstrating robust organisation of the feature space for interactive labelling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.00506v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Context-Aware Dual-Metric Framework for Confidence Estimation in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00600</link><description>arXiv:2508.00600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications. Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided. To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics. First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second, unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through the global consistency of the generated answers with and without context. Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness, achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.00600v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TestWeaver: Execution-aware, Feedback-driven Regression Testing Generation with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01255</link><description>arXiv:2508.01255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating test generation for regression testing, they often suffer from limited reasoning about program execution, resulting in stagnated coverage growth - a phenomenon known as the coverage plateau. This paper presents TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates lightweight program analysis to create a focused execution context that assists LLMs in better test generation. TestWeaver strategically chooses the following components to overcome LLMs' limited reasoning on complex execution: (1) it reduces hallucinations and improves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target line instead of a full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close test cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the target line - to provide focused execution context within the LLM's context window; and (3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode variable states as comments along the executed path. By equipping LLMs with these targeted and contextualized inputs, it improves coverage-guided test generation and mitigates redundant explorations. Empirical results show that TestWeaver accelerates code coverage growth and generates more effective test cases than the state-of-the-art approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.01255v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] $R^2$-CoD: Understanding Text-Graph Complementarity in Relational Reasoning via Knowledge Co-Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01475</link><description>arXiv:2508.01475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why their integration is beneficial.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.01475v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Web-CogReasoner: Towards Knowledge-Induced Cognitive Reasoning for Web Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01858</link><description>arXiv:2508.01858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore, we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1) Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2) Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation technology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.02806v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SoilNet: A Multimodal Multitask Model for Hierarchical Classification of Soil Horizons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03785</link><description>arXiv:2508.03785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular foundation models, have improved the state of the art in many application domains including geosciences. Some specific problems, however, could not benefit from this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil condition. In this work, we propose \textit{SoilNet} - a multimodal multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized pipeline. In contrast to omnipurpose AI foundation models, our approach is designed to be inherently transparent by following the task structure human experts developed for solving this challenging annotation task. The proposed approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates. Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially structured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world soil profile dataset and a comprehensive user study with domain experts. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that SoilNet reliably predicts soil horizons that are plausible and accurate. User study results indicate that SoilNet achieves predictive performance on par with or better than that of human experts.

Abstract: We examine, analyze, and compare four representative creativity measures--perplexity, LLM-as-a-Judge, the Creativity Index (CI; measuring n-gram overlap with web corpora), and syntactic templates (detecting repetition of common part-of-speech patterns)--across the diverse creative domains, such as creative writing, unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. For each domain, we compile datasets with human-aligned creative and uncreative examples and evaluate each metric's ability to discriminate between the two sets. Our analyses reveal limited consistency both across domains and metrics, as metrics that distinguish creativity in one domain fail in others (e.g., CI correctly distinguishes in creative writing but fails in problem-solving), and different metrics often disagree on the same data points (e.g., CI suggests one set to be more creative, while perplexity indicates the other set to be more creative.) We highlight key limitations, such as perplexity reflecting fluency rather than novelty; LLM-as-a-Judge producing inconsistent judgments under minor prompt variations and exhibiting bias towards particular labels; CI primarily measuring lexical diversity, with high sensitivity to implementation choices; and syntactic templates being ineffective in settings dominated by formulaic language. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human judgments of creativity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05470v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Holistic Explainable AI (H-XAI): Extending Transparency Beyond Developers in AI-Driven Decision Making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05792</link><description>arXiv:2508.05792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI systems increasingly mediate decisions in domains such as credit scoring and financial forecasting, their lack of transparency and bias raises critical concerns for fairness and public trust. Existing explainable AI (XAI) approaches largely serve developers, focusing on model justification rather than the needs of affected users or regulators. We introduce Holistic eXplainable AI (H-XAI), a framework that integrates causality-based rating methods with post-hoc explanation techniques to support transparent, stakeholder-aligned evaluation of AI systems deployed in online decision contexts. H-XAI treats explanation as an interactive, hypothesis-driven process, allowing users, auditors, and organizations to ask questions, test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically generated random and biased baselines. By combining global and instance-level explanations, H-XAI helps communicate model bias and instability that shape everyday digital decisions. Through case studies in credit risk assessment and stock price prediction, we show how H-XAI extends explainability beyond developers toward responsible and inclusive AI practices that strengthen accountability in sociotechnical systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05792v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Remote Sensing Image Intelligent Interpretation with the Language-Centered Perspective: Principles, Methods and Challenges</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06832</link><description>arXiv:2508.06832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mainstream paradigm of remote sensing image interpretation has long been dominated by vision-centered models, which rely on visual features for semantic understanding. However, these models face inherent limitations in handling multi-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making. While recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote sensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications, lacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of language. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to language-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a language-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs as the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action spaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We first explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in remote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges, including unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and reasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global workspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered solutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research directions from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task understanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and autonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for the next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a roadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.06832v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CCFQA: A Benchmark for Cross-Lingual and Cross-Modal Speech and Text Factuality Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07295</link><description>arXiv:2508.07295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly popularized in the multilingual world, ensuring hallucination-free factuality becomes markedly crucial. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly focus on textual or visual modalities with a primary emphasis on English, which creates a gap in evaluation when processing multilingual input, especially in speech. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Factuality benchmark (CCFQA). Specifically, the CCFQA benchmark contains parallel speech-text factual questions across 8 languages, designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' cross-lingual and cross-modal factuality capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that current MLLMs still face substantial challenges on the CCFQA benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers the Question Answering (QA) capabilities of LLMs in English to multilingual Spoken Question Answering (SQA) tasks, achieving competitive performance with GPT-4o-mini-Audio using just 5-shot training. We release CCFQA as a foundational research resource to promote the development of MLLMs with more robust and reliable speech understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage (\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.07667v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recent Advances and Trends in Research Paper Recommender Systems: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08828</link><description>arXiv:2508.08828v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditions, loops, and function calls. We further curate a collection of complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following ability.

Abstract: We present a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems. Starting from a model trained on low-fidelity or observational data, we apply a differentiable post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of governing partial differential equations (PDEs), promoting physical consistency and adherence to boundary conditions without distorting the underlying learned distribution. To infer unknown physical inputs, such as source terms, material parameters, or boundary data, we augment the generative process with a learnable latent parameter predictor and propose a joint optimization strategy. The resulting model produces physically valid field solutions alongside plausible estimates of hidden parameters, effectively addressing ill-posed inverse problems in a data-driven yet physicsaware manner. We validate our method on canonical PDE benchmarks, demonstrating improved satisfaction of PDE constraints and accurate recovery of latent coefficients. Our approach bridges generative modelling and scientific inference, opening new avenues for simulation-augmented discovery and data-efficient modelling of physical systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.09156v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Detect Unseen Jailbreak Attacks in Large Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09201</link><description>arXiv:2508.09201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. To mitigate these risks, existing detection methods are essential, yet they face two major challenges: generalization and accuracy. While learning-based methods trained on specific attacks fail to generalize to unseen attacks, learning-free methods based on hand-crafted heuristics suffer from limited accuracy and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a learnable framework that eliminates the need for any attack data or hand-crafted heuristics. LoD operates by first extracting layer-wise safety representations directly from the model's internal activations using Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vectors classifiers, and then converting the high-dimensional representations into a one-dimensional anomaly score for detection via a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoD consistently achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (AUROC) across diverse unseen jailbreak attacks on multiple LVLMs, while also significantly improving efficiency.

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced Novel View Synthesis (NVS) through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS) to address these challenges. Our key innovations: the Gradient Coherence Ratio (GCR), computed through normalized gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control. Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact scene representations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.09239v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Route Planning and Online Routing for Quantum Key Distribution Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09735</link><description>arXiv:2508.09735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks harness the principles of quantum physics in order to securely transmit cryptographic key material, providing physical guarantees. These networks require traditional management and operational components, such as routing information through the network elements. However, due to the limitations on capacity and the particularities of information handling in these networks, traditional shortest paths algorithms for routing perform poorly on both route planning and online routing, which is counterintuitive. Moreover, due to the scarce resources in such networks, often the expressed demand cannot be met by any assignment of routes. To address both the route planning problem and the need for fair automated suggestions in infeasible cases, we propose to model this problem as a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem. For the online routing problem, we showcase that the shortest (available) paths routing strategy performs poorly in the online setting. Furthermore, we prove that the widest shortest path routing strategy has a competitive ratio greater or equal than $\frac{1}{2}$, efficiently addressing both routing modes in QKD networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.09735v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Is On-Policy Data always the Best Choice for Direct Preference Optimization-based LM Alignment?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10530</link><description>arXiv:2508.10530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The alignment of language models~(LMs) with human preferences is critical for building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization~(DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling~(i.e., preference candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment. However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a $3\times$ effectiveness compared with static data for Llama-3, and a $0.4\times$ effectiveness for Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption, which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on $5$ models~(Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and $2$ alignment methods~(DPO, SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and the effectiveness of the boundary measurement algorithm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10530v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Value-based Process Verifier via Low-Cost Variance Reduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10539</link><description>arXiv:2508.10539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning. Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo (MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator (MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte \textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points, the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32 sampling experiment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10539v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Monotone Neural Barrier Certificates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12178</link><description>arXiv:2508.12178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a neurosymbolic framework for safety verification and control synthesis in high-dimensional monotone dynamical systems without relying on explicit models or conservative Lipschitz bounds. The approach combines the expressiveness of neural networks with the rigor of symbolic reasoning via barrier certificates, functional analogs of inductive invariants that formally guarantee safety. Prior data-driven methods often treat dynamics as black-box models, relying on dense state-space discretization or Lipschitz overapproximations, leading to exponential sample complexity. In contrast, monotonicity--a pervasive structural property in many real-world systems--provides a symbolic scaffold that simplifies both learning and verification. Exploiting order preservation reduces verification to localized boundary checks, transforming a high-dimensional problem into a tractable, low-dimensional one. Barrier certificates are synthesized using monotone neural network architectures with embedded monotonicity constraints--trained via gradient-based optimization guided by barrier conditions. This enables scalable, formally sound verification directly from simulation data, bridging black-box learning and formal guarantees within a unified neurosymbolic framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.12178v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Semantic Inference over the Air: An Efficient Task-Oriented Communication System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12748</link><description>arXiv:2508.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empowered by deep learning, semantic communication marks a paradigm shift from transmitting raw data to conveying task-relevant meaning, enabling more efficient and intelligent wireless systems. In this study, we explore a deep learning-based task-oriented communication framework that jointly considers classification performance, computational latency, and communication cost. We evaluate ResNets-based models on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to simulate real-world classification tasks in wireless environments. We partition the model at various points to simulate split inference across a wireless channel. By varying the split location and the size of the transmitted semantic feature vector, we systematically analyze the trade-offs between task accuracy and resource efficiency. Experimental results show that, with appropriate model partitioning and semantic feature compression, the system can retain over 85\% of baseline accuracy while significantly reducing both computational load and communication overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.12748v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Not in My Backyard": LLMs Uncover Online and Offline Social Biases Against Homelessnes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13187</link><description>arXiv:2508.13187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide. Over 876,000 people experienced homelessness (PEH) in the U.S. in 2025. Social bias is a significant barrier to alleviation, shaping public perception and influencing policymaking. Given that online textual media and offline city council discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable insights to identify and track social biases against PEH. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-domain dataset compiled from Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes across ten U.S. cities. Our 16-category multi-label taxonomy creates a challenging long-tail classification problem: some categories appear in less than 1% of samples, while others exceed 70%. We find that small human-annotated datasets (1,702 samples) are insufficient for training effective classifiers, whether used to fine-tune encoder models or as few-shot examples for LLMs. To address this, we use GPT-4.1 to generate pseudo-labels on a larger unlabeled corpus. Training on this expanded dataset enables even small encoder models (ModernBERT, 150M parameters) to achieve 35.23 macro-F1, approaching GPT-4.1's 41.57. This demonstrates that \textbf{data quantity matters more than model size}, enabling low-cost, privacy-preserving deployment without relying on commercial APIs. Our results reveal that negative bias against PEH is prevalent both offline and online (especially on Reddit), with "not in my backyard" narratives showing the highest engagement. These findings uncover a type of ostracism that directly impacts poverty-reduction policymaking and provide actionable insights for practitioners addressing homelessness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.13187v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diversity-Augmented Negative Sampling for Implicit Collaborative Filtering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14468</link><description>arXiv:2508.14468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommenders built upon implicit collaborative filtering are typically trained to distinguish between users' positive and negative preferences. When direct observations of the latter are unavailable, negative training data are constructed with sampling techniques. But since items often exhibit clustering in the latent space, existing methods tend to oversample negatives from dense regions, resulting in homogeneous training data and limited model expressiveness. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel negative sampler with diversity guarantees. To achieve them, our approach first pairs each positive item of a user with one that they have not yet interacted with; this instance, called hard negative, is chosen as the top-scoring item according to the model. Instead of discarding the remaining highly informative items, we store them in a user-specific cache. Next, our diversity-augmented sampler selects a representative subset of negatives from the cache, ensuring its dissimilarity from the corresponding user's hard negatives. Our generator then combines these items with the hard negatives, replacing them to produce more effective (synthetic) negative training data that are informative and diverse. Experiments show that our method consistently leads to superior recommendation quality without sacrificing computational efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.14468v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BASIL: Bayesian Assessment of Sycophancy in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16846</link><description>arXiv:2508.16846v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sycophancy (overly agreeable or flattering behavior) poses a fundamental challenge for human-AI collaboration, particularly in high-stakes decision-making domains such as health, law, and education. A central difficulty in studying sycophancy in large language models (LLMs) is disentangling sycophantic belief shifts from rational changes in behavior driven by new evidence or user-provided information. Existing approaches either measure descriptive behavior changes or apply normative evaluations that rely on objective ground truth, limiting their applicability to subjective or uncertain tasks. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic framework, grounded in behavioral economics and rational decision theory, that explicitly separates sycophancy from rational belief updating. Within this framework, we achieve three objectives: (i) a descriptive metric that measures sycophancy while controlling for rational responses to evidence; (ii) a normative metric that quantifies how sycophancy leads models astray from Bayesian-consistent belief updating; and (iii) the ability to apply both metrics in settings without ground-truth labels. Applying our framework across multiple LLMs and three uncertainty-driven tasks, we find robust evidence of sycophantic belief shifts and show that their impact on rationality depends on whether models systematically over- or under-update their beliefs. Finally, we demonstrate that a post-hoc calibration method and two fine-tuning strategies (SFT and DPO) substantially reduce Bayesian inconsistency, with particularly strong improvements under explicit sycophancy prompting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.16846v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Assessing the Effectiveness of Deep Embeddings for Tree Species Classification in the Dutch Forest Inventory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18829</link><description>arXiv:2508.18829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: National Forest Inventory serves as the primary source of forest information, however, maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns by forestry experts to identify and document tree species. Embeddings from deep pre-trained remote sensing models offer new opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While training new deep learning models on few data points remains challenging, we show that using pre-computed embeddings can proven effective for distinguishing tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patternsin combination with Random Forest. This work systematically investigates how deep embeddings improve tree species classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. We evaluate this question on three embedding models: Presto, Alpha Earth, and Tessera, using three tree species datasets of varying difficulty. Data-wise, we compare the available embeddings from Alpha Earth and Tessera with dynamically calculated embeddings from a pre-trained Presto model. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series pre-trained model outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the Netherlands, yielding performance gains of approximately 2-9 percentage points across datasets and evaluation metrics. This indicates that classic hand-defined features are too simple for this task and highlights the potential of using deep embeddings for data-limited applications such as NFI classification. By leveraging openly available satellite data and deep embeddings from pre-trained models, this approach significantly improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.18829v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards On-Device Personalization: Cloud-device Collaborative Data Augmentation for Efficient On-device Language Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21313</link><description>arXiv:2508.21313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), significant progress has been achieved in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, existing LLMs still face two major challenges that hinder their broader adoption: (1) their responses tend to be generic and lack personalization tailored to individual users, and (2) they rely heavily on cloud infrastructure due to intensive computational requirements, leading to stable network dependency and response delay. Recent research has predominantly focused on either developing cloud-based personalized LLMs or exploring the on-device deployment of general-purpose LLMs. However, few studies have addressed both limitations simultaneously by investigating personalized on-device language models. To bridge this gap, we propose CDCDA-PLM, a framework for deploying personalized on-device language models on user devices with support from a powerful cloud-based LLM. Specifically, CDCDA-PLM leverages the server-side LLM's strong generalization capabilities to augment users' limited personal data, mitigating the issue of data scarcity. Using both real and synthetic data, A personalized on-device language models (LMs) is fine-tuned via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules and deployed on users' local devices, enabling them to process queries without depending on cloud-based LLMs. This approach eliminates reliance on network stability and ensures high response speeds. Experimental results across six tasks in a widely used personalization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of CDCDA-PLM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.21313v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-Generated Explanations Do Not Suffice for Ultra-Strong Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00961</link><description>arXiv:2509.00961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. We introduce LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic framework that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models (LLMs). This framework automatically generates natural language explanations of learned logic programs, replacing hand-crafted templates used in prior USML work. Using LLMs-as-judges evaluation and expert validation, we show that LENS produces higher-quality explanations than both direct LLM prompting and hand-crafted templates. We then examine whether LENS explanations suffice for achieving USML in a human trial teaching active learning strategies across three related domains. Our exploratory analysis suggests that concise, expert-written explanations may benefit learners with higher initial performance, while LLM-generated explanations provide no advantage over human self learning despite being rated as higher quality. This case study reveals that achieving USML requires methods grounded in human learning, where current LLM-generated explanations do not capture human cognitive constraints and LLMs-as-judges evaluations do not reflect what effectively supports human learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.00961v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Non-Asymptotic Performance Analysis of DOA Estimation Based on Real-Valued Root-MUSIC</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01999</link><description>arXiv:2509.01999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic theoretical performance analysis of the Real-Valued root-MUSIC (RV-root-MUSIC) algorithm under non-asymptotic conditions. A well-known limitation of RV-root-MUSIC is the estimation ambiguity caused by mirror roots, which are typically suppressed using conventional beamforming (CBF). By leveraging the equivalent subspace constructed through the conjugate extension method and exploiting the equivalence of perturbations for true and mirror roots, this work provides a comprehensive study of three key aspects: noise subspace perturbation, true-root perturbation, and mirror-root perturbation. A statistical model is established, and generalized perturbation expressions are derived. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the correctness and effectiveness of the theoretical results. The analysis provides a rigorous foundation for parameter optimization in Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation, with applications in radar, wireless communications, and intelligent sensing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.01999v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Computational Cognitive Modeling to understand the effects of Racializing AI on Human-AI cooperation with PigChase Task</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04636</link><description>arXiv:2509.04636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the continued anthropomorphization of AI systems, the potential impact of racialization during human-AI interaction is understudied. This study explores how human-AI cooperation may be impacted by the belief that data used to train an AI system is racialized, that is, it was trained on data from a specific group of people. During this study, participants completed a human-AI cooperation task using the Pig Chase game. Participants of different self-identified demographics interacted with AI agents whose perceived racial identities were manipulated, allowing us to assess how sociocultural perspectives influence the decision-making of participants in the game. After the game, participants completed a survey questionnaire to explain the strategies they used while playing the game and to understand the perceived intelligence of their AI teammates. Statistical analysis of task behavior data revealed a statistically significant effect of the participant's demographic, as well as the interaction between this self-identified demographic and the treatment condition (i.e., the perceived demographic of the agent). The results indicated that Non-White participants viewed AI agents racialized as White in a positive way compared to AI agents racialized as Black. Both Black and White participants viewed the AI agent in the control treatment in a negative way. A baseline cognitive model of the task using ACT-R cognitive architecture was used to understand a cognitive-level, process-based explanation of the participants' perspectives based on results found from the study. This model helps us better understand the factors affecting the decision-making strategies of the game participants. Results from analysis of these data, as well as cognitive modeling, indicate a need to expand understanding of the ways racialization (whether implicit or explicit) impacts interaction with AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.04636v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prior Distribution and Model Confidence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05485</link><description>arXiv:2509.05485v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urbanization monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis, previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Abstract: A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each component's quantized output to match its original. Motivated by this idea, most layer-wise post-training quantization (PTQ) methods focus on weight approximation at the linear-layer level. As a result, this local objective often yields insufficient approximations and practical deviations from the guiding intuition. Recent work has improved the approximation of linear-layer outputs within the layer-wise PTQ framework, but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full-model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structure of mainstream LLMs, we propose LoaQ, which incorporates output-matching factors when quantizing linear layers within the layer-wise PTQ framework. It better aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution, making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06297v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ruggedized Ultrasound Sensing in Harsh Conditions: eRTIS in the wild</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10029</link><description>arXiv:2509.10029v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is critical for timely intervention, yet most diagnoses are delayed until advanced stages. While comprehensive patient narratives are essential for accurate diagnosis, prior work has largely focused on screening studies that classify cognitive status from interactions rather than supporting the diagnostic process. We designed voice-interactive conversational agents, leveraging large language models (LLMs), to elicit narratives relevant to ADRD from patients and informants. We evaluated the agent with 30 adults with suspected ADRD through conversation analysis, user surveys, and analysis of symptom elicitation compared to blinded specialist interviews. Symptoms detected by the agent showed promising agreement with those identified by specialists. Users appreciated the agent's patience and systematic questioning, which supported engagement and expression of complex, hard-to-describe experiences. While these findings suggest potential for conversational agents as structured diagnostic support tools, further validation with larger samples and assessment of clinical utility is needed before deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11478v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trustworthy and Confidential SBOM Exchange</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13217</link><description>arXiv:2509.13217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have become a regulatory requirement for improving software supply chain security and trust by means of transparency regarding components that make up software artifacts. However, enterprise and regulated software vendors commonly wish to restrict who can view confidential software metadata recorded in their SBOMs due to intellectual property or security vulnerability information. To address this tension between transparency and confidentiality, we propose Petra, an SBOM exchange system that empowers software vendors to interoperably compose and distribute redacted SBOM data using selective encryption. Petra enables software consumers to search redacted SBOMs for answers to specific security questions without revealing information they are not authorized to access. Petra leverages a format-agnostic, tamper-evident SBOM representation to generate efficient and confidentiality-preserving integrity proofs, allowing interested parties to cryptographically audit and establish trust in redacted SBOMs. Exchanging redacted SBOMs in our Petra prototype requires less than 1 extra KB per SBOM, and SBOM decryption accounts for at most 1% of the performance overhead during an SBOM query.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.13217v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TextMineX: Data, Evaluation Framework and Ontology-guided LLM Pipeline for Humanitarian Mine Action</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15098</link><description>arXiv:2509.15098v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) addresses the challenge of detecting and removing landmines from conflict regions.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is critical in domains like energy, finance, healthcare, and logistics, requiring models that generalize across diverse datasets. Large pre-trained models such as Chronos and Time-MoE show strong zero-shot (ZS) performance but suffer from high computational costs. In this work, we introduce Super-Linear, a lightweight and scalable mixture-of-experts (MoE) model for general forecasting. It replaces deep architectures with simple frequency-specialized linear experts, trained on resampled data across multiple frequency regimes. A lightweight spectral gating mechanism dynamically selects relevant experts, enabling efficient, accurate forecasting. Despite its simplicity, Super-Linear demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks, while substantially improving efficiency, robustness to sampling rates, and interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), a dual-domain neural operator jointly parameterized by both spectral and spatial bases with intrinsic symbolic interpretability. We theoretically demonstrate that KANO overcomes the pure-spectral bottleneck of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO): KANO remains expressive over generic position-dependent dynamics (variable coefficient PDEs) for any physical input, whereas FNO stays practical only for spectrally sparse operators and strictly imposes a fast-decaying input Fourier tail. We verify our claims empirically on position-dependent differential operators, for which KANO robustly generalizes but FNO fails to. In the quantum Hamiltonian learning benchmark, KANO reconstructs ground-truth Hamiltonians in closed-form symbolic representations accurate to the fourth decimal place in coefficients and attains $\approx 6\times10^{-6}$ state infidelity from projective measurement data, substantially outperforming that of the FNO trained with ideal full wave function data, $\approx 1.5\times10^{-2}$, by orders of magnitude.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.16825v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QWHA: Quantization-Aware Walsh-Hadamard Adaptation for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning on Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17428</link><description>arXiv:2509.17428v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The demand for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) has driven interest in quantization, which reduces inference cost, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which lowers training overhead. This motivated the development of quantization-aware PEFT to produce accurate yet efficient quantized models. In this setting, reducing quantization error prior to fine-tuning is crucial for achieving high model accuracy. However, existing methods that rely on low-rank adaptation suffer from limited representational capacity. Recent Fourier-related transform (FT)-based adapters offer greater representational power than low-rank adapters, but their direct integration into quantized models often results in ineffective error reduction and increased computational overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose QWHA, a method that integrates FT-based adapters into quantized models by employing the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) as the transform kernel, together with a novel adapter initialization scheme incorporating adaptive parameter selection and value refinement. We demonstrate that QWHA effectively mitigates quantization errors while facilitating fine-tuning, and that its design substantially reduces computational cost. Experimental results show that QWHA consistently outperforms baselines in low-bit quantization accuracy and achieves significant training speedups over existing FT-based adapters.

Abstract: Non-native English speakers performing English-related tasks at work struggle to sustain EFL learning, despite their motivation. Often, study materials are disconnected from their work context. Our formative study revealed that reviewing work-related English becomes burdensome with current systems, especially after work. Although workers rely on LLM-based assistants to address their immediate needs, these interactions may not directly contribute to their English skills. We present LingoQ, an AI-mediated system that allows workers to practice English using quizzes generated from their LLM queries during work. LingoQ leverages these on-the-fly queries using AI to generate personalized quizzes that workers can review and practice on their smartphones. We conducted a three-week deployment study with 28 EFL workers to evaluate LingoQ. Participants valued the quality-assured, work-situated quizzes and constantly engaging with the app during the study. This active engagement improved self-efficacy and led to learning gains for beginners and, potentially, for intermediate learners. Drawing on these results, we discuss design implications for leveraging workers' growing reliance on LLMs to foster proficiency and engagement while respecting work boundaries and ethics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.17477v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AECBench: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Knowledge Evaluation of Large Language Models in the AEC Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18776</link><description>arXiv:2509.18776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain. The benchmark features a five-level, cognition-oriented evaluation framework (i.e., Knowledge Memorization, Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application). Based on the framework, 23 representative evaluation tasks were defined. These tasks were derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review. Furthermore, an "LLM-as-a-Judge" approach was introduced to provide a scalable and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits, particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents. Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into safety-critical engineering practices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.18776v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explaining Grokking and Information Bottleneck through Neural Collapse Emergence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20829</link><description>arXiv:2509.20829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings on multiple datasets and architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.20829v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who Gets Cited Most?

Abstract: We introduce SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by creating benchmark questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple full-text scientific articles. The questions and their ground-truth answers are automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database constructed from article metadata (i.e., titles, authors, and references). These SQL queries provide explicit, verifiable reasoning processes that enable fine-grained error analysis on model answers, and the data construction scales to contexts of up to 1M tokens with minimal supervision. Experiments on open-weight and proprietary LLMs show that SciTrek poses significant challenges as the context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic shortcomings of frontier LLMs' ability to effectively perform numerical operations and accurately locate information in long contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21028v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21044</link><description>arXiv:2509.21044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across multiple model families and mathematical datasets shows two robust effects of online RL post-training: (i) an overall increase in average activation intensity, indicating that more internal pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain its advantage in mathematical generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based approaches.

Abstract: Mainstream ranking approaches typically follow a Generator-Evaluator two-stage paradigm, where a generator produces candidate lists and an evaluator selects the best one. Recent work has attempted to enhance performance by expanding the number of candidate lists, for example, through multi-generator settings. However, ranking involves selecting a recommendation list from a combinatorially large space. Simply enlarging the candidate set remains ineffective, and performance gains quickly saturate. At the same time, recent advances in large recommendation models have shown that end-to-end one-stage models can achieve promising performance with the expectation of scaling laws. Motivated by this, we revisit ranking from a generator-only one-stage perspective. We theoretically prove that, for any (finite Multi-)Generator-Evaluator model, there always exists a generator-only model that achieves strictly smaller approximation error to the optimal ranking policy, while also enjoying scaling laws as its size increases. Building on this result, we derive an evidence upper bound of the one-stage optimization objective, from which we find that one can leverage a reward model trained on real user feedback to construct a reference policy in a group-relative manner. This reference policy serves as a practical surrogate of the optimal policy, enabling effective training of a large generator-only ranker. Based on these insights, we propose GoalRank, a generator-only ranking framework. Extensive offline experiments on public benchmarks and large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate that GoalRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22046v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] JointDiff: Bridging Continuous and Discrete in Multi-Agent Trajectory Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22522</link><description>arXiv:2509.22522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22522v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22562</link><description>arXiv:2509.22562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings: (i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22562v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593</link><description>arXiv:2509.23593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1 variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular, forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is more than halved on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks, while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.23593v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Characteristic Root Analysis and Regularization for Linear Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23597</link><description>arXiv:2509.23597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains, yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust, interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.23597v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiffInk: Glyph- and Style-Aware Latent Diffusion Transformer for Text to Online Handwriting Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23624</link><description>arXiv:2509.23624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation (TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled. We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while significantly improving generation efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.23624v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models for Image Quality Assessment via Voting and Ranking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25787</link><description>arXiv:2509.25787v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities, their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks. Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA benchmarks. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates significant flexibility, allowing it to be stacked with pre-trained IQA models to bolster generalization on unseen datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25787v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM Agents for Knowledge Discovery in Atomic Layer Processing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26201</link><description>arXiv:2509.26201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited probe capabilities without explicit instructions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26201v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient and Transferable Agentic Knowledge Graph RAG via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26383</link><description>arXiv:2509.26383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency in image generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01478v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SingMOS-Pro: An Comprehensive Benchmark for Singing Quality Assessment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01812</link><description>arXiv:2510.01812v4 Announce Type: replace

Each clip is rated by at least five experienced annotators to ensure reliability and consistency. Furthermore, we investigate strategies for effectively utilizing MOS data annotated under heterogeneous standards and benchmark several widely used evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong baselines and practical references for future research.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02091v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Universal Multi-Domain Translation via Diffusion Routers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03252</link><description>arXiv:2510.03252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-domain translation (MDT) aims to learn translations between multiple domains, yet existing approaches either require fully aligned tuples or can only handle domain pairs seen in training, limiting their practicality and excluding many cross-domain mappings. We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem, we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks, DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations, while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03252v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Universal Beta Splatting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03312</link><description>arXiv:2510.03312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs. dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering while consistently outperforming existing methods across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable universal primitive for radiance field rendering.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in optimal hyperparameter transfer under model and dataset scaling, no unifying explanatory principle has been established. For Adam and Scion optimizers, we discover that joint optimal scaling across model and dataset sizes is conditioned on a single invariant: the operator norm of the output layer. Across models with up to 1.3B parameters trained on up to 138B tokens, the optimal learning rate/batch size pair $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ consistently has the same operator norm value - a phenomenon we term norm transfer. This constant norm condition is necessary but not sufficient: while for each dataset size, multiple $(\eta, B)$ reach the optimal norm, only a unique $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ achieves the best loss. As a sufficient condition, we provide the first measurement of $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ scaling with dataset size for Scion, and find that the scaling rules are consistent with those of Adam. Tuning per-layer-group learning rates also improves model performance, with the output layer being the most sensitive and hidden layers benefiting from lower learning rates. We provide practical insights on norm-guided optimal scaling and release our Distributed Scion (Disco) implementation with logs from over two thousand runs to support research on LLM training dynamics at scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03871v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAC-Opt: Semantic Anchors for Iterative Correction in Optimization Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05115</link><description>arXiv:2510.05115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average modeling accuracy by 7.7%, with gains of up to 21.9% on the ComplexLP dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation from problem intent to solver-executable code.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05115v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MetaVLA: Unified Meta Co-training For Efficient Embodied Adaption</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05580</link><description>arXiv:2510.05580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning, incur high compute costs, and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified, backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment. MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead. On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K, and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied agents.

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized through tasks such as instance segmentation, visual grounding, and object detection -- enables applications ranging from robotic perception to photo editing. These fundamental problems in computer vision are powered by large-scale, painstakingly annotated datasets. Despite their impact, these datasets are costly to build, biased in coverage, and difficult to scale. Synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative but struggle with flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We introduce Synthetic Object Compositions (SOC), an accurate and scalable data synthesis pipeline via a novel object-centric composition strategy. It composes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using 3D geometric layout augmentation and camera configuration augmentation with generative harmonization and mask-area-weighted blending, yielding accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions.
  Models trained on just 100K of our synthetic images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT 20M, V3Det 200K) and synthetic pipelines (Copy-Paste, X-Paste, SynGround, SegGen) by +24-36% -- achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO. Beyond the general open-vocabulary setup, SOC also enables controllable dataset construction for different use cases and boosts performance in both low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios.
  Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments delivers strong performance across different real-data scales and yields even greater improvements under extremely limited real-data conditions, including +6.59 AP on a 1% COCO data setup. Furthermore, this controllability enables targeted data generation for intra-class referring, a diagnostic grounding task we propose that requires fine-grained attribute discrimination.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.09110v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Temporal Lifting as Latent-Space Regularization for Continuous-Time Flow Models in AI Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09805</link><description>arXiv:2510.09805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal lifting for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization operator that can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.09805v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A-IPO: Adaptive Intent-driven Preference Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10077</link><description>arXiv:2510.10077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive \textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference \textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of $\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6 Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.10077v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MSCloudCAM: Multi-Scale Context Adaptation with Convolutional Cross-Attention for Multispectral Cloud Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10802</link><description>arXiv:2510.10802v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clouds remain a major obstacle in optical satellite imaging, limiting accurate environmental and climate analysis. To address the strong spectral variability and the large scale differences among cloud types, we propose MSCloudCAM, a novel multi-scale context adapter network with convolution based cross-attention tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud segmentation. A key contribution of MSCloudCAM is the explicit modeling of multiple complementary multi-scale context extractors. And also, rather than simply stacking or concatenating their outputs, our formulation uses one extractor's fine-resolution features and the other extractor's global contextual representations enabling dynamic, scale-aware feature selection. Building on this idea, we design a new convolution-based cross attention adapter that effectively fuses localized, detailed information with broader multi-scale context. Integrated with a hierarchical vision backbone and refined through channel and spatial attention mechanisms, MSCloudCAM achieves strong spectral-spatial discrimination. Experiments on various multisensor datatsets e.g. CloudSEN12 (Sentinel-2) and L8Biome (Landsat-8), demonstrate that MSCloudCAM achieves superior overall segmentation performance and competitive class-wise accuracy compared to recent state-of-the-art models, while maintaining competitive model complexity, highlighting the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed design for large-scale Earth observation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.10802v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DND: Boosting Large Language Models with Dynamic Nested Depth</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11001</link><description>arXiv:2510.11001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer, DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by 0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11001v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vlaser: Vision-Language-Action Model with Synergistic Embodied Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11027</link><description>arXiv:2510.11027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data. Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11027v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Psychometric Tests Work for Large Language Models?

Abstract: Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs in large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these tests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when applied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and validity of human psychometric tests on 17 LLMs for three constructs: sexism, racism, and morality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt variations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing theory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing the alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream tasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in some cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks, indicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic evaluations of psychometric tests on LLMs are essential before interpreting their scores. Our findings also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be applied directly to LLMs without adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11254v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-Specific Utility: A New Perspective for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11358</link><description>arXiv:2510.11358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is typically optimized for topical relevance, yet its success ultimately depends on whether retrieved passages are useful for a large language model (LLM) to generate correct and complete answers. We argue that such utility is often LLM-specific rather than universal, due to differences in models' knowledge, reasoning, and ability to leverage evidence. We formalize LLM-specific utility as the performance improvement of a target LLM when a passage is provided, compared to answering without evidence. To systematically study LLM-specific utility, we construct a benchmark of LLM-specific gold utilitarian passages for four LLMs (Qwen3-8B/14B/32B and Llama3.1-8B) on three QA datasets (Natural Questions, TriviaQA, and MS MARCO-FQA). Our analysis shows that utilitarian passages are model-dependent and non-transferable: each LLM performs best with its own utilitarian evidence, while evidence optimized for other LLMs is consistently suboptimal. Human-annotated evidence remains a strong general baseline but does not fully match individual LLM utility needs. We further introduce the LLM-specific utility judgment task and find that existing utility-aware selection and scoring methods largely capture model-agnostic usefulness and struggle to reliably estimate LLM-specific utility. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of current utility-aware retrieval and motivate generator-tailored evidence selection for improving RAG.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11358v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Epistemic-aware Vision-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Interpretation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12953</link><description>arXiv:2510.12953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable.

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements, which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover, SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.14296v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Role of Social Learning and Collective Norm Formation in Fostering Cooperation in LLM Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14401</link><description>arXiv:2510.14401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing body of multi-agent studies with LLMs explores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where pursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work has explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and simplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool resource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly tied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without explicit knowledge of the payoff structure or how individual actions translate into long-run outcomes, relying instead on heuristics, communication, and enforcement. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms: social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance. Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring, and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key findings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine norm evolution across a $2\times2$ grid of environmental and social initialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and benchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these conditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining cooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed for studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can inform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts, where alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and effective governance of AI-mediated environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.14401v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Holdout-Loss-Based Data Selection for LLM Finetuning via In-Context Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14459</link><description>arXiv:2510.14459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a principled, resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional finetuning. We define the resulting estimate as the ICA score, and derive per-example weights that dynamically reweight gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score update frequency and the number of in-context holdout examples. We also discuss limitations in rapidly drifting on-policy settings, highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.14459v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SMOTE and Mirrors: Exposing Privacy Leakage from Synthetic Minority Oversampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15083</link><description>arXiv:2510.15083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one of the most widely used methods for addressing class imbalance and generating synthetic data. Despite its popularity, little attention has been paid to its privacy implications; yet, it is used in the wild in many privacy-sensitive applications. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of privacy leakage in SMOTE: We begin by showing that prevailing evaluation practices, i.e., naive distinguishing and distance-to-closest-record metrics, completely fail to detect any leakage and that membership inference attacks (MIAs) can be instantiated with high accuracy. Then, by exploiting SMOTE's geometric properties, we build two novel attacks with very limited assumptions: DistinSMOTE, which perfectly distinguishes real from synthetic records in augmented datasets, and ReconSMOTE, which reconstructs real minority records from synthetic datasets with perfect precision and recall approaching one under realistic imbalance ratios. We also provide theoretical guarantees for both attacks. Experiments on eight standard imbalanced datasets confirm the practicality and effectiveness of these attacks. Overall, our work reveals that SMOTE is inherently non-private and disproportionately exposes minority records, highlighting the need to reconsider its use in privacy-sensitive applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.15083v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DSSmoothing: Toward Certified Dataset Ownership Verification for Pre-trained Language Models via Dual-Space Smoothing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15303</link><description>arXiv:2510.15303v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large web-scale datasets have driven the rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs), but unauthorized data usage has raised serious copyright concerns. Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations. We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs under a gray-box setting (i.e., the defender can only query the suspicious model but is aware of its input representation module), based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness (WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks.

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise, logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs) often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will be released publicly.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.15600v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Art Practice for Sustainability: A Cognitive-Affective-Systemic Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17083</link><description>arXiv:2510.17083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a cognitive-Affective-Systemic (CAS) framework that integrates cognition, emotion, and systemic understanding to cultivate sustainability awareness through art. Drawing from eco-aesthetics, affect theory, complexity science, and posthuman ethics, the framework defines artistic practice as both epistemic and performative--a way of knowing through making and feeling. Central to this is logomotion, an aesthetic mode where comprehension and emotion move together as a unified experience. Two artworks, SPill, visualizing antimicrobial resistance through avalanche dynamics, and Echoes of the Land, modeling anthropogenic seismicity, demonstrate how systemic modeling and sensory immersion transform complex science into embodied ecological understanding. The framework offers a methodological foundation for artists, theorists, and activists to translate awareness into engagement, advancing collective creativity toward sustainable futures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17083v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generation then Reconstruction: Accelerating Masked Autoregressive Models via Two-Stage Sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17171</link><description>arXiv:2510.17171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding, followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens. Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover, observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1), substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model scales and generation tasks.

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between continuous speech signals and large language models, yet face an inherent conflict between acoustic fidelity and semantic preservation. To mitigate this conflict, prevailing methods augment acoustic codecs with complex semantic supervision. We explore the opposite direction: a semantic-first approach that starts from a semantically-capable model and adapts it for high-fidelity acoustic reconstruction. Through empirical analysis, we discover that targeted architectural simplification can unlock the acoustic modeling potential of Whisper, a text-aligned Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. Based on this finding, we propose SimWhisper-Codec, a novel codec that balances the semantic and acoustic preservation by leveraging a frozen, simplified Whisper encoder without requiring external supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that SimWhisper-Codec achieves superior performance in both semantic preservation and acoustic quality compared to semantically-supervised codecs such as Mimi Codec and SpeechTokenizer at similar bitrates, validating the effectiveness of our semantic-first approach.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a 'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design, enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.20691v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SCoPE VLM: Selective Context Processing for Efficient Document Navigation in Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21850</link><description>arXiv:2510.21850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions. To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored reinforcement learning method to bridge the gap between training and inference. Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.21850v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Monotone and Separable Set Functions: Characterizations and Neural Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23634</link><description>arXiv:2510.23634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity. We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions. Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias.

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed ``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components. However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1) they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning (when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning, resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge, we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in sparse reward policy gradient methods have enabled effective reinforcement learning (RL) for language models post-training. However, for reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem solving, binarized outcome rewards provide limited feedback on intermediate reasoning steps. While some studies have attempted to address this issue by estimating overall reasoning quality, it remains unclear whether these rewards are reliable proxies for the quality of stepwise reasoning. In this study, we consider reasoning as a structured process and propose \textbf{TACReward}, the reward model that can be seamlessly integrated into sparse reward policy gradient methods without additional human annotation costs or architectural modifications. TACReward aggregates stepwise structural deviations between teacher and policy reasoning using process mining techniques, producing a scalar output reward range of $[0, 1]$ to indicate reasoning quality. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the TACReward into sparse reward frameworks encourages the policy model to improve the structural quality of reasoning. Consequently, this leads to consistent performance improvements over existing sparse reward frameworks.

Abstract: Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) offers broadband, per channel heralded EPR pairs, with a rich parameter space that allows its performance to be tailored for specific applications. We present a modular ZALM simulator that demonstrates how design choices affect output rate and fidelity. Built in NetSquid with QSI controllers, it exposes 20+ tunable parameters, supports IDEAL and REALISTIC modes, and provides reusable components for Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) sources, interference, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) filtering, fiber delay, active polarization gates, detectors, and lossy fiber. Physics based models capture Hong Ou Mandel (HOM) visibility, insertion loss, detector efficiency, gate errors, and attenuation. Using this tool, we map trade offs among fidelity, link distance, and entangled pairs per use, and show how SPDC bandwidth and DWDM grid spacing steer performance. Using the default configuration settings, average fidelity remains constant at 0.83 but the ebit rate decreases from 0.0175 at the source to 0.0 at 50 km; narrowing the SPDC degeneracy bandwidth increases the ebit rate significantly without affecting fidelity. The simulator enables codesign of source, filtering, and feedforward settings for specific quantum memories and integrates as a building block for end to end quantum network studies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26009v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ResMatching: Noise-Resilient Computational Super-Resolution via Guided Conditional Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26601</link><description>arXiv:2510.26601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques, stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here, we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4 diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results, demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases, enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26601v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FedAdamW: A Communication-Efficient Optimizer with Convergence and Generalization Guarantees for Federated Large Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27486</link><description>arXiv:2510.27486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2) the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first \underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW}, for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting. \texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$ without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of \texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy.

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents, consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator during training to derive the common representation from the local representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual transformation of features between the local representation space and the common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To better align local representations to the common representation containing multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully distilled into the sender.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.27647v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] H-FA: A Hybrid Floating-Point and Logarithmic Approach to Hardware Accelerated FlashAttention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00295</link><description>arXiv:2511.00295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have significantly advanced AI and machine learning through their powerful attention mechanism. However, computing attention on long sequences can become a computational bottleneck. FlashAttention mitigates this by fusing the softmax and matrix operations into a tiled computation pattern that decouples performance from sequence length. Though designed for GPUs, its simplicity also makes it well suited for direct hardware acceleration. To improve hardware implementation, we compute FlashAttention using a mixture of floating-point and fixed-point logarithm domain representations. Floating-point is used to compute attention scores from query and key matrices, while logarithmic computation simplifies the fused computation of softmax normalization and the multiplication with the value matrix. This transformation, called H-FA, replaces vector-wide floating-point multiplication and division operations by additions and subtractions implemented efficiently with fixed-point arithmetic in the logarithm domain. Exponential function evaluations are effectively omitted and fused with the rest operations, and the final result is directly returned to floating-point arithmetic without any additional hardware overhead. Hardware implementation results at 28nm demonstrate that H-FA achieves a 26.5% reduction in area and a 23.4% reduction in power, on average, compared to FlashAttention parallel hardware architectures built solely with floating-point datapaths, without hindering performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.00295v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531</link><description>arXiv:2511.02531v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.02531v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CBMC-V3: A CNS-inspired Control Framework Towards Agile Manipulation with SNN</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04109</link><description>arXiv:2511.04109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As robotic arm applications expand beyond traditional industrial settings into service-oriented domains such as catering, household and retail, existing control algorithms struggle to achieve the level of agile manipulation required in unstructured environments characterized by dynamic trajectories, unpredictable interactions, and diverse objects. This paper presents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Network (SNN), inspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to address these challenges. The proposed framework comprises five control modules-cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord-organized into three hierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, and third-order) and two information pathways (ascending and descending). All modules are fully implemented using SNN. The framework is validated through both simulation and experiments on a commercial robotic arm platform across a range of control tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline in terms of agile motion control capability, offering a practical and effective solution for achieving agile manipulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.04109v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parallel Spawning Strategies for Dynamic-Aware MPI Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04268</link><description>arXiv:2511.04268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic resource management is an increasingly important capability of High Performance Computing systems, as it enables jobs to adjust their resource allocation at runtime. This capability can reduce workload makespan, substantially decreasing job waiting times and optimizing resource allocation. In this context, malleability refers to the ability of applications to adapt to new resource allocations during execution. Although beneficial, malleability incurs significant reconfiguration costs, making the reduction of these costs an important research topic. Some existing solutions for MPI applications respawn the entire application, which is an expensive solution that avoids the reuse of original processes. Other MPI solutions reuse them, but fail to fully release unneeded processes when shrinking, since some ranks within the same communicator remain active across nodes, preventing the application from returning those nodes to the system. This work overcomes both limitations by proposing a novel parallel spawning strategy, in which all processes cooperate in the spawning. This allows expansions to reuse processes while also terminating unneeded ones.
  This strategy has been validated on two systems with either machines with equal or different numbers of cores. Experiments show that this strategy preserves competitive expansion times with at most a $1.13\times$ and $1.25\times$ overhead for equal and different number of cores per node, respectively. More importantly, it enables fast shrink operations that reduce their cost by at least $1387\times$ and $20\times$ in the same scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.04268v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Studying the Effect of Explicit Interaction Representations on Learning Scene-level Distributions of Human Trajectories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04375</link><description>arXiv:2511.04375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effectively capturing the joint distribution of all agents in a scene is relevant for predicting the true evolution of the scene and in turn providing more accurate information to the decision processes of autonomous vehicles. While new models have been developed for this purpose in recent years, it remains unclear how to best represent the joint distributions particularly from the perspective of the interactions between agents. Thus far there is no clear consensus on how best to represent interactions between agents; whether they should be learned implicitly from data by neural networks, or explicitly modeled using the spatial and temporal relations that are more grounded in human decision-making. This paper aims to study various means of describing interactions within the same network structure and their effect on the final learned joint distributions. Our findings show that more often than not, simply allowing a network to establish interactive connections between agents based on data has a detrimental effect on performance. Instead, having well defined interactions (such as which agent of an agent pair passes first at an intersection) can often bring about a clear boost in performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.04375v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Regularization for Large-Scale Sparse Feature Embedding Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06374</link><description>arXiv:2511.06374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-epoch overfitting problem has drawn widespread attention, especially in CTR and CVR estimation models in search, advertising, and recommendation domains. These models which rely heavily on large-scale sparse categorical features, often suffer a significant decline in performance when trained for multiple epochs. Although recent studies have proposed heuristic solutions, the fundamental cause of this phenomenon remains unclear. In this work, we present a theoretical explanation grounded in Rademacher complexity, supported by empirical experiments, to explain why overfitting occurs in models with large-scale sparse categorical features. Based on this analysis, we propose a regularization method that constrains the norm budget of embedding layers adaptively. Our approach not only prevents the severe performance degradation observed during multi-epoch training, but also improves model performance within a single epoch. This method has already been deployed in online production systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.06374v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analogical Structure, Minimal Contextual Cues and Contrastive Distractors: Input Design for Sample-Efficient Linguistic Rule Induction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10441</link><description>arXiv:2511.10441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance on many tasks, but their training makes it hard to see which properties of the input support efficient linguistic rule learning. We ask how three cognitively-inspired principles of input design support sample-efficient linguistic rule induction: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cue. We also ask how their effects compare to those of LLMs on the same controlled tasks. We implement these principles in structured sentence completion tasks that test English verb alternations. Lightweight models trained on hundreds to one-thousand such examples learn the alternation rules with high F1 on these tasks. Ablation studies show that analogical organisation is the main driver of sample efficiency, and contrastive distractors and minimal context help further gains. We also evaluate zero- and few-shot LLMs on the same tasks. In this controlled setting, the lightweight models reach higher F1 with far fewer task-specific data. We treat this contrast as a comparison between learning regimes rather than a general verdict on LLMs. Our results show that careful input organisation supports sample-efficient learning of linguistic rules and reveals distinct learning signatures for trained lightweight models and prompted LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.10441v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Don't Waste It: Guiding Generative Recommenders with Structured Human Priors via Multi-Head Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10492</link><description>arXiv:2511.10492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing recommender systems for objectives beyond accuracy, such as diversity, novelty, and personalization, is crucial for long-term user satisfaction. To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner.
  Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.10492v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parameter-Efficient MoE LoRA for Few-Shot Multi-Style Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11236</link><description>arXiv:2511.11236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models have seen expanding application across domains, yet their effectiveness as assistive tools for scientific writing - an endeavor requiring precision, multimodal synthesis, and domain expertise - remains insufficiently understood. We examine the potential of LLMs to support domain experts in scientific writing, with a focus on abstract composition. We design an incentivized randomized controlled trial with a hypothetical conference setup where participants with relevant expertise are split into an author and reviewer pool. Inspired by methods in behavioral science, our novel incentive structure encourages authors to edit the provided abstracts to an acceptable quality for a peer-reviewed submission. Our 2 x 2 between-subject design expands into two dimensions: the implicit source of the provided abstract and the disclosure of it. We find authors make most edits when editing human-written abstracts compared to AI-generated abstracts without source attribution, often guided by higher perceived readability in AI generation. Upon disclosure of source information, the volume of edits converges in both source treatments. Reviewer decisions remain unaffected by the source of the abstract, but bear a significant correlation with the number of edits made. Careful stylistic edits, especially in the case of AI-generated abstracts, in the presence of source information, improve the chance of acceptance. We find that AI-generated abstracts hold potential to reach comparable levels of acceptability to human-written ones with minimal revision, and that perceptions of AI authorship, rather than objective quality, drive much of the observed editing behavior. Our findings reverberate the significance of source disclosure in collaborative scientific writing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.12529v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convolutional Model Trees</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12725</link><description>arXiv:2511.12725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method for creating a forest of model trees to fit samples of a function defined on images is described in several steps: down-sampling the images, determining a tree's hyperplanes, applying convolutions to the hyperplanes to handle small distortions of training images, and creating forests of model trees to increase accuracy and achieve a smooth fit. A 1-to-1 correspondence among pixels of images, coefficients of hyperplanes and coefficients of leaf functions offers the possibility of dealing with larger distortions such as arbitrary rotations or changes of perspective. A theoretical method for smoothing forest outputs to produce a continuously differentiable approximation is described. Within that framework, a training procedure is proved to converge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.12725v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conformal Online Learning of Deep Koopman Linear Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12760</link><description>arXiv:2511.12760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Conformal Online Learning of Koopman embeddings (COLoKe), a novel framework for adaptively updating Koopman-invariant representations of nonlinear dynamical systems from streaming data. Our modeling approach combines deep feature learning with multistep prediction consistency in the lifted space, where the dynamics evolve linearly. To prevent overfitting, COLoKe employs a conformal-style mechanism that shifts the focus from evaluating the conformity of new states to assessing the consistency of the current Koopman model. Updates are triggered only when the current model's prediction error exceeds a dynamically calibrated threshold, allowing selective refinement of the Koopman operator and embedding. Empirical results on benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate the effectiveness of COLoKe in maintaining long-term predictive accuracy while significantly reducing unnecessary updates and avoiding overfitting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.12760v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Investigating Test Overfitting on SWE-bench</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16858</link><description>arXiv:2511.16858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tests can be useful towards resolving issues on code repositories. However, relying too much on tests for issue resolution can lead to code that technically passes observed tests but actually misses important cases or even breaks functionality. This problem, called test overfitting, is exacerbated by the fact that issues usually lack readily executable tests. Instead, several issue resolution systems use tests auto-generated from issues, which may be imperfect. Some systems even iteratively refine code and tests jointly. This paper presents the first empirical study of test overfitting in this setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.16858v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Odd-DC: Generalizable Neural Model Reduction via Odd Difference-of-Convex Structure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18241</link><description>arXiv:2511.18241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model reduction is essential for real-time simulation of deformable objects. Linear techniques such as PCA provide structured and predictable behavior, but their limited expressiveness restricts accuracy under large or nonlinear deformations. Nonlinear model reduction with neural networks offers richer representations and higher compression; however, without structural constraints, the learned mapping from latent coordinates to displacements often generalizes poorly beyond the training distribution.
  We present an odd difference-of-convex (DC) neural formulation that bridges linear and nonlinear model reduction. Our goal is to obtain a latent space that behaves reliably under unseen load magnitudes and directions. To improve extrapolation in magnitude, we introduce convexity into the decoder to discourage oscillatory responses. Yet convexity alone cannot represent the odd symmetry required by many symmetric systems, which is crucial for generalization to inverse force directions. We therefore adopt a DC formulation that preserves the stabilizing effect of convexity while explicitly enforcing odd symmetry. Practically, we realize this structure using an input-convex neural network (ICNN) augmented with symmetry constraints.
  Across challenging deformation scenarios with varying magnitudes and reversed load directions, our method demonstrates stronger generalization than unconstrained nonlinear reductions while maintaining compact latent spaces and real-time performance. Our DC formulation extends to both mesh-based and neural-field reductions, demonstrating applicability across multiple classes of neural nonlinear model reduction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.18241v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiVE-k: Differential Visual Reasoning for Fine-grained Image Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18305</link><description>arXiv:2511.18305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) possess extensive text knowledge but struggles to utilize this knowledge for fine-grained image recognition, often failing to differentiate between visually similar categories. Existing fine-tuning methods using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with exact-match reward signals are often brittle, encourage memorization of training categories, and fail to elicit differential reasoning needed for generalization to unseen classes. To address this, we propose $\textbf{DiVE-k}$, $\textbf{Di}$fferential $\textbf{V}$isual r$\textbf{E}$asoning using top-$\textbf{k}$ generations, framework that leverages model's own top-k predictions as a training signal. For each training image, DiVE-k creates a multiple-choice question from the model's top-k outputs and uses RL to train the model to select the correct answer. This approach requires the model to perform fine-grained differential reasoning among plausible options and provides a simple, verifiable reward signal that mitigates memorization and improves generalization. Experiments on five standard fine-grained datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. In the standard base-to-novel generalization setting, DiVE-k surpasses the QWEN2.5-VL-7B and ViRFT by 10.04% and 6.16% on the Harmonic Mean metric, respectively. Further experiments show similar gains in mixed-domain and few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.21105v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semantic-aware Random Convolution and Source Matching for Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01510</link><description>arXiv:2512.01510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the challenging problem of single-source domain generalization (DG) for medical image segmentation, where we train a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. Our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently at training-time, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware. Overall, our evaluation shows that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance in DG for medical image segmentation, even matching the performance of the in-domain baseline in several settings. We will release our source code upon acceptance of this manuscript.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.01510v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The lonely runner conjecture holds for nine runners</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01912</link><description>arXiv:2512.01912v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: In emergency response and other high-stakes societal applications, early-stage state estimates critically shape downstream outcomes. Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.03102v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reconstructing KV Caches with Cross-layer Fusion For Enhanced Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03870</link><description>arXiv:2512.03870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer decoders have achieved strong results across tasks, but the memory required for the KV cache becomes prohibitive at long sequence lengths. Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.03870v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] K2-V2: A 360-Open, Reasoning-Enhanced LLM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06201</link><description>arXiv:2512.06201v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in intensive care units (ICUs) patients is crucial for timely interventions and resource allocation. However, variability in patient populations, clinical practices, and electronic health record (EHR) systems across institutions introduces domain shifts that degrade the generalization performance of predictive models during deployment. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such shifts by adapting models dynamically during inference without requiring labeled target-domain data. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Test-Time Training (AdaTTT), an enhanced TTT framework tailored for EHR-based IMV prediction in ICU settings. We begin by deriving information-theoretic bounds on the test-time prediction error and demonstrate that it is constrained by the uncertainty between the main and auxiliary tasks. To enhance their alignment, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework with pretext tasks: reconstruction and masked feature modeling optimized through a dynamic masking strategy that emphasizes features critical to the main task. Additionally, to improve robustness against domain shifts, we incorporate prototype learning and employ Partial Optimal Transport (POT) for flexible, partial feature alignment while maintaining clinically meaningful patient representations. Experiments across multi-center ICU cohorts demonstrate competitive classification performance on different test-time adaptation benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.06652v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Astra: General Interactive World Model with Autoregressive Denoising</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08931</link><description>arXiv:2512.08931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers have empowered video generation models to generate high-quality video clips from texts or images. However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.08931v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GS-KAN: Parameter-Efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks via Sprecher-Type Shared Basis Functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09084</link><description>arXiv:2512.09084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem offers a theoretical alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by placing learnable univariate functions on edges rather than nodes. While recent implementations such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) demonstrate high approximation capabilities, they suffer from significant parameter inefficiency due to the requirement of maintaining unique parameterizations for every network edge. In this work, we propose GS-KAN (Generalized Sprecher-KAN), a lightweight architecture inspired by David Sprecher's refinement of the superposition theorem. GS-KAN constructs unique edge functions by applying learnable linear transformations to a single learnable, shared parent function per layer. We evaluate GS-KAN against existing KAN architectures and MLPs across synthetic function approximation, tabular data regression and image classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that GS-KAN outperforms both MLPs and standard KAN baselines on continuous function approximation tasks while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Additionally, GS-KAN achieves competitive performance with existing KAN architectures on tabular regression and outperforms MLPs on high-dimensional classification tasks. Crucially, the proposed architecture enables the deployment of KAN-based architectures in high-dimensional regimes under strict parameter constraints, a setting where standard implementations are typically infeasible due to parameter explosion.

Abstract: Iterative LLM systems(self-refinement, chain-of-thought, autonomous agents) are increasingly deployed, yet their temporal dynamics remain uncharacterized. Prior work evaluates task performance at convergence but ignores the trajectory: how does semantic content evolve across iterations? Does it stabilize, drift, or oscillate? Without answering these questions, we cannot predict system behavior, guarantee stability, or systematically design iterative architectures.
  We formalize agentic loops as discrete dynamical systems in semantic space. Borrowing from dynamical systems theory, we define trajectories, attractors and dynamical regimes for recursive LLM transformations, providing rigorous geometric definitions adapted to this setting. Our framework reveals that agentic loops exhibit classifiable dynamics: contractive (convergence toward stable semantic attractors), oscillatory (cycling among attractors), or exploratory (unbounded divergence).
  Experiments on singular loops validate the framework. Iterative paraphrasing produces contractive dynamics with measurable attractor formation and decreasing dispersion. Iterative negation produces exploratory dynamics with no stable structure. Crucially, prompt design directly controls the dynamical regime - the same model exhibits fundamentally different geometric behaviors depending solely on the transformation applied.
  This work establishes that iterative LLM dynamics are predictable and controllable, opening new directions for stability analysis, trajectory forecasting, and principled design of composite loops that balance convergence and exploration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10350v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalized Spherical Neural Operators: Green's Function Formulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10723</link><description>arXiv:2512.10723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural operators offer powerful approaches for solving parametric partial differential equations, but extending them to spherical domains remains challenging due to the need to preserve intrinsic geometry while avoiding distortions that break rotational consistency. Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a generalized operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to non-equivariant systems while retaining spectral efficiency and grid invariance. To exploit GSNO, we develop SHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation. Evaluations on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting, GSNO and SHNet consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. The theoretical and experimental results position GSNO as a principled and generalized framework for spherical operator design and learning, bridging rigorous theory with real-world complexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10723v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Memorization: Selective Learning for Copyright-Safe Diffusion Model Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11194</link><description>arXiv:2512.11194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memorization in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models poses significant security and intellectual property risks, enabling adversarial attribute extraction and the unauthorized reproduction of sensitive or proprietary features. While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective learning at the concept level.
  We introduce a gradient projection method designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework drastically reduces memorization while rigorously preserving generation quality and semantic fidelity. By reframing memorization control as selective learning, our approach establishes a new paradigm for IP-safe and privacy-preserving generative AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11194v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Study of Library Usage in Agent-Authored Pull Requests</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11589</link><description>arXiv:2512.11589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coding agents are becoming increasingly capable of completing end-to-end software engineering workflows that previously required a human developer, including raising pull requests (PRs) to propose their changes. However, we still know little about how these agents use libraries when generating code, a core part of real-world software development. To fill this gap, we study 26,760 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset to examine three questions: how often do agents import libraries, how often do they introduce new dependencies (and with what versioning), and which specific libraries do they choose? We find that agents often import libraries (29.5% of PRs) but rarely add new dependencies (1.3% of PRs); and when they do, they follow strong versioning practices (75.0% specify a version), an improvement on direct LLM usage where versions are rarely mentioned. Generally, agents draw from a surprisingly diverse set of external libraries, contrasting with the limited "library preferences" seen in prior non-agentic LLM studies. Our findings offer an early empirical view on how AI coding agents interact with today's software ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11589v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ATLAS: Automated Tree-based Language Analysis System for C and C++ source programs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12507</link><description>arXiv:2512.12507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing non-compilable C/C++ submodules without a resolved build environment remains a critical bottleneck for industrial software evolution. Traditional static analysis tools often fail in these scenarios due to their reliance on successful compilation, while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the structural context necessary to reason about complex program logic. We introduce ATLAS, a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI). It is characterized by: (i) inter-procedural, type-aware analysis that captures dependencies across function boundaries; (ii) support for both full-project and partial analysis of non-compilable projects; (iii) graph optimizations, such as variable collapsing and node blacklisting; and (iv) synchronized multi-view graphs that align syntax, execution paths, and data-flow logic. Evaluating ATLAS with DeepSeek V3.2 for automated test generation demonstrates a 34.71% increase in line coverage and 32.66% in branch coverage, achieving performance on par with and even exceeding the industry-standard symbolic execution tool KLEE on complex projects. With polynomial scalability, ATLAS provides a robust infrastructure for generating the information-dense datasets required by next-generation, graph-aware Machine Learning for Software Engineering (ML4SE) models.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has achieved impressive progress in language model reasoning, it is constrained by the requirement for verifiable rewards. Recent verifier-free RL methods address this limitation by utilizing the probabilities that LLMs generate reference answers as reward signals. However, these approaches typically sample reasoning traces conditioned only on the question. This design decouples reasoning-trace sampling from answer information, leading to inefficient exploration and incoherence between traces and final answers. In this paper, we propose \textit{\b{Co}upled \b{V}ariational \b{R}einforcement \b{L}earning} (CoVRL), which bridges variational inference and reinforcement learning by coupling prior and posterior distributions through a hybrid sampling strategy. By constructing and optimizing a composite distribution that integrates these two distributions, CoVRL enables efficient exploration while preserving strong thought-answer coherence. Extensive experiments on mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that CoVRL improves performance by 12.4\% over the base model and achieves an additional 2.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art verifier-free RL baselines, providing a principled framework for enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of language models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.12576v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning under Distributional Drift: Reproducibility as an Intrinsic Statistical Resource</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13506</link><description>arXiv:2512.13506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical learning under distributional drift remains insufficiently characterized: when each observation alters the data-generating law, classical generalization bounds can collapse. We introduce a new statistical primitive, the reproducibility budget $C_T$, which quantifies a system's finite capacity for statistical reproducibility: the extent to which its sampling process can remain governed by a consistent underlying distribution in the presence of both exogenous change and endogenous feedback. Formally, $C_T$ is defined as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution, measuring the total distributional motion accumulated during learning. From this construct we derive a drift-feedback generalization bound of order $O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$, and we prove a matching minimax lower bound showing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Consequently, the results establish a reproducibility speed limit: no algorithm can achieve smaller worst-case generalization error than that imposed by the average Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T/T$ of the data-generating process. The framework situates exogenous drift, adaptive data analysis, and performative prediction within a common geometric structure, with $C_T$ emerging as the intrinsic quantity measuring distributional motion across these settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.13506v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Multimodal Person Recognition: A Robust Framework for Handling Missing Modalities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14961</link><description>arXiv:2512.14961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Person identification systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently present with missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal person identification framework incorporating upper-body motion, face, and voice. Experimental results demonstrate that body motion outperforms traditional modalities such as face and voice in within-session evaluations, while serving as a complementary cue that enhances performance in multi-session scenarios. Our model employs a unified hybrid fusion strategy, fusing both feature-level and score-level information to maximize representational richness and decision accuracy. Specifically, it leverages multi-task learning to process modalities independently, followed by cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to exploit both unimodal information and cross-modal interactions. Finally, a confidence-weighted strategy and mistake-correction mechanism dynamically adapt to missing data, ensuring that our single classification head achieves optimal performance even in unimodal and bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark in this work for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed trimodal system achieves 99.51% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a widely used evaluation protocol and reach 99.92% accuracy in bimodal mode, outperforming conventional approaches. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.14961v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Imitation Game: Reproducing Deep Learning Bugs Leveraging an Intelligent Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14990</link><description>arXiv:2512.14990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their wide adoption in various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, software engineering), Deep Learning (DL)-based applications suffer from many bugs, failures, and vulnerabilities. Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.14990v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantifying Fidelity: A Decisive Feature Approach to Comparing Synthetic and Real Imagery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16468</link><description>arXiv:2512.16468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on consistent decision evidence in both real and simulated environments, not just whether images "look real" to humans. To this end this paper proposes a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity, that is, agreement in the model-specific decisive evidence that drives the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16468v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Training and Merging Through Momentum-Aware Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17109</link><description>arXiv:2512.17109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training large neural networks and merging task specific models both exploit low rank structure and require parameter importance estimation, yet these challenges have been pursued in isolation. Current workflows compute curvature information during training, discard it, then recompute similar information for merging wasting computation and discarding valuable trajectory data. We introduce a unified framework that maintains factorized momentum and curvature statistics during training, then reuses this information for geometry aware model composition. The proposed method incurs modest memory overhead (approximately 30% over AdamW) to accumulate task saliency scores that enable curvature aware merging. These scores, computed as a byproduct of optimization, provide importance estimates comparable to post hoc Fisher computation while producing merge-ready models directly from training. We establish convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives with approximation error bounded by gradient singular value decay. On natural language understanding benchmarks, curvature aware parameter selection outperforms magnitude only baselines across all sparsity levels, with multi-task merging improving 1.6% over strong baselines. The proposed framework exhibits rank-invariant convergence and superior hyperparameter robustness compared to existing low-rank optimizers. By treating the optimization trajectory as a reusable asset rather than discarding it, our approach demonstrates that training-time curvature information suffices for effective model composition, enabling a unified training merging pipeline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.17109v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SGCR: A Specification-Grounded Framework for Trustworthy LLM Code Review</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17540</link><description>arXiv:2512.17540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automating code review with Large Language Models (LLMs) shows immense promise, yet practical adoption is hampered by their lack of reliability, context-awareness, and control. To address this, we propose Specification-Grounded Code Review (SGCR), a framework that grounds LLMs in human-authored specifications to produce trustworthy and relevant feedback. SGCR features a novel dual-pathway architecture: an explicit path ensures deterministic compliance with predefined rules derived from these specifications, while an implicit path heuristically discovers and verifies issues beyond those rules. Deployed in a live industrial environment at HiThink Research, SGCR's suggestions achieved a 42% developer adoption rate-a 90.9% relative improvement over a baseline LLM (22%). Our work demonstrates that specification-grounding is a powerful paradigm for bridging the gap between the generative power of LLMs and the rigorous reliability demands of software engineering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.17540v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Evidence-Driven Analysis of Threat Information Sharing Challenges for Industrial Control Systems and Future Directions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18714</link><description>arXiv:2512.18714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing cyber threats to critical infrastructure highlight the importance of private companies and government agencies in detecting and sharing information about threat activities. Although the need for improved threat information sharing is widely recognized, various technical and organizational challenges persist, hindering effective collaboration. In this study, we review the challenges that disturb the sharing of usable threat information to critical infrastructure operators within the ICS domain. We analyze three major incidents: Stuxnet, Industroyer, and Triton. In addition, we perform a systematic analysis of 196 procedure examples across 79 MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK techniques from 22 ICS-related malware families, utilizing automated natural language processing techniques to systematically extract and categorize threat observables. Additionally, we investigated nine recent ICS vulnerability advisories from the CISA Known Exploitable Vulnerability catalog. Our analysis identified four important limitations in the ICS threat information sharing ecosystem: (i) the lack of coherent representation of artifacts related to ICS adversarial techniques in information sharing language standards (e.g., STIX); (ii) the dependence on undocumented proprietary technologies; (iii) limited technical details provided in vulnerability and threat incident reports; and (iv) the accessibility of technical details for observed adversarial techniques. This study aims to guide the development of future information-sharing standards, including the enhancement of the cyber-observable objects schema in STIX, to ensure accurate representation of artifacts specific to ICS environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18714v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond the Prompt: An Empirical Study of Cursor Rules</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18925</link><description>arXiv:2512.18925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, research shows that their effectiveness depends not only on explicit prompts but also on the broader context provided. This requirement is especially pronounced in software engineering, where the goals, architecture, and collaborative conventions of an existing project play critical roles in response quality. To support this, many AI coding assistants have introduced ways for developers to author persistent, machine-readable directives that encode a project's unique constraints. Although this practice is growing, the content of these directives remains unstudied.
  This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to characterize this emerging form of developer-provided context. Through a qualitative analysis of 401 open-source repositories containing cursor rules, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of project context that developers consider essential, organized into five high-level themes: Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, and Examples. Our study also explores how this context varies across different project types and programming languages, offering implications for the next generation of context-aware AI developer tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18925v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-World Adversarial Attacks on RF-Based Drone Detectors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20712</link><description>arXiv:2512.20712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) based systems are increasingly used to detect drones by analyzing their RF signal patterns, converting them into spectrogram images which are processed by object detection models. Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitations. We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications. We evaluated the attack using RF recordings and OTA experiments with four types of drones. Our results show that modest, structured I/Q perturbations are compatible with standard RF chains and reliably reduce target drone detection while preserving detection of legitimate drones.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20712v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SVBench: Evaluation of Video Generation Models on Social Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21507</link><description>arXiv:2512.21507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent text-to-video generation models exhibit remarkable progress in visual realism, motion fidelity, and text-video alignment, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to generate socially coherent behavior. Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21507v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HybridFlow: Resource-Adaptive Subtask Routing for Efficient Edge-Cloud LLM Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22137</link><description>arXiv:2512.22137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge-cloud collaborative inference is becoming a practical necessity for LLM-powered edge devices: on-device models often cannot afford the required reasoning capability, while cloud-only inference could be prohibitively costly and slow under strict latency and token/API budgets. However, existing edge-cloud collaboration methods often route per query or fixed steps simply based-on the estimated difficulty. Such coarse and static heuristics overlook subtask dependencies, missing opportunities for parallel execution and budget-adaptive routing. To this end, we propose \textbf{HybridFlow}, a resource-adaptive edge-cloud inference framework that (i) builds a dependency-aware DAG for each query and executes newly unlocked subtasks in parallel, reducing end-to-end latency; (ii) routes each subtask online to the edge or cloud via a learned benefit--cost utility model that dynamically trades accuracy gains against token/API and latency budgets, thereby reducing unnecessary cloud usage while preserving reasoning quality. Across GPQA, MMLU-Pro, AIME24, and LiveBench-Reasoning, HybridFlow improves the cost-accuracy trade-off, reducing latency and cloud API usage while maintaining competitive accuracy against strong structured reasoning baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22137v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cluster Aggregated GAN (CAG): A Cluster-Based Hybrid Model for Appliance Pattern Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22287</link><description>arXiv:2512.22287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic appliance data are essential for developing non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms and enabling privacy preserving energy research, yet the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a significant barrier. Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability. These findings establish the proposed framework as an effective approach for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22287v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Early-Stage Prediction of Review Effort in AI-Generated Pull Requests</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00753</link><description>arXiv:2601.00753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI coding agents evolve from autocomplete tools to autonomous "AI workforce" teammates, they introduce a critical new bottleneck: human maintainers must now manage complex interaction loops rather than just reviewing code. Analyzing 33,707 agent-authored PRs, we uncover a stark two-regime reality: agents excel at narrow automation (28.3% of PRs merge instantly), but frequently fail at iterative refinement, leading to "ghosting" (abandonment) when faced with subjective feedback. This creates a hidden "attention tax" on maintainers. We introduce a creation-time Circuit Breaker model to predict high-maintenance PRs before human review begins. By leveraging simple static complexity cues (e.g., file types, patch size), our model identifies the "expensive tail" of contributions with AUC 0.96, enabling a gated triage process. At a 20% review budget, this approach captures 69% of the high-effort PRs, effectively allowing maintainers to fast-fail costly, low-quality agent contributions while fast-tracking simple fixes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00753v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Jenius Agent: Towards Experience-Driven Accuracy Optimization in Real-World Scenarios</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01857</link><description>arXiv:2601.01857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) advance, improving performance in context understanding, tool usage, and long-horizon execution has become critical. However, existing agent frameworks and benchmarks provide limited visibility into execution-level behavior, making failures in tool invocation, state tracking, and context management difficult to diagnose. This paper presents Jenius-Agent, a system-level agent framework grounded in real-world deployment experience. It integrates adaptive prompt generation, context-aware tool orchestration, and layered memory mechanism to stabilize execution and improve robustness in long-horizon, tool-augmented tasks. Beyond system design, we introduce an evaluation methodology that jointly measures procedural fidelity, semantic correctness, and efficiency. This framework makes agent behavior observable as a structured execution process and enables systematic analysis of failure modes not captured by output-only metrics. Experiments on Jenius-bench show substantial improvements in task completion rate, with up to a 35 percent relative gain over the base agent, along with reduced token consumption, response latency, and tool invocation failures. The framework is already deployed in Jenius ({https://www.jenius.cn}), providing a lightweight and scalable solution for robust, protocol-compatible autonomous agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01857v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prompt-Counterfactual Explanations for Generative AI System Behavior</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03156</link><description>arXiv:2601.03156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior. In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03156v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MGPC: Multimodal Network for Generalizable Point Cloud Completion With Modality Dropout and Progressive Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03660</link><description>arXiv:2601.03660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover complete 3D geometry from partial observations caused by limited viewpoints and occlusions. Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks. However, due to the limitations of modality, scalability, and generative capacity, their generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03660v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How to Analyse Interviews: A Documentary Method of Interpretation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05871</link><description>arXiv:2601.05871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interviews are commonplace in HCI. This paper presents a novel documentary method of interpretation that supports analysis of the topics contained within a collection of transcripts, topics that are endogenous to it and which elaborate participants collective reasoning about issues of relevance to research. We contrast endogenous topic analysis with established qualitative approaches, including content analysis, grounded theory, interpretative phenomenological analysis, and thematic analysis, to draw out the distinctive character of the documentary method of interpretation. Unlike established methods, the DMI does not require that the analyst be proficient in qualitative analysis, or have sound knowledge of underlying theories and methods. The DMI is a members method, not a social science method, that relies on mastery of natural language; a competence most people possess.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05871v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large-Scale Continual Scheduling and Execution for Dynamic Distributed Satellite Constellation Observation Allocation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06188</link><description>arXiv:2601.06188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The size and capabilities of Earth-observing satellite constellations are rapidly increasing. Leveraging distributed onboard control, we can enable novel time-sensitive measurements and responses. However, deploying autonomy to large multiagent satellite systems necessitates algorithms with efficient computation and communication. We tackle this challenge and propose new, online algorithms for large-scale dynamic distributed constraint optimization problems (DDCOP). We present the Dynamic Multi-Satellite Constellation Observation Scheduling Problem (DCOSP), a new formulation of DDCOPs that models integrated scheduling and execution. We construct an omniscient offline algorithm to compute the novel optimality condition of DCOSP and present the Dynamic Incremental Neighborhood Stochastic Search (D-NSS) algorithm, an incomplete online decomposition-based DDCOP approach. We show through simulation that D-NSS converges to near-optimal solutions and outperforms DDCOP baselines in terms of solution quality, computation time, and message volume. Our work forms the foundation of the largest in-space demonstration of distributed multiagent AI to date: the NASA FAME mission.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06188v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Peformance Isolation for Inference Processes in Edge GPU Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07600</link><description>arXiv:2601.07600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work analyzes the main isolation mechanisms available in modern NVIDIA GPUs: MPS, MIG, and the recent Green Contexts, to ensure predictable inference time in safety-critical applications using deep learning models. The experimental methodology includes performance tests, evaluation of partitioning impact, and analysis of temporal isolation between processes, considering both the NVIDIA A100 and Jetson Orin platforms. It is observed that MIG provides a high level of isolation. At the same time, Green Contexts represent a promising alternative for edge devices by enabling fine-grained SM allocation with low overhead, albeit without memory isolation.

Abstract: Equipping agents with memory is essential for solving real-world long-horizon problems. However, most existing agent memory mechanisms rely on static and hand-crafted workflows. This limits the performance and generalization ability of these memory designs, which highlights the need for a more flexible, learning-based memory framework. In this paper, we propose AtomMem, which reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem. We deconstruct high-level memory processes into fundamental atomic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, transforming the memory workflow into a learnable decision process. By combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, AtomMem learns an autonomous, task-aligned policy to orchestrate memory behaviors tailored to specific task demands. Experimental results across 3 long-context benchmarks demonstrate that the trained AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods. Further analysis of training dynamics shows that our learning-based formulation enables the agent to discover structured, task-aligned memory management strategies, highlighting a key advantage over predefined routines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08323v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Implicit Hate Speech Detection via a Community-Driven Multi-Agent Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09342</link><description>arXiv:2601.09342v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Multimodal video captioning condenses dense footage into a structured format of keyframes and natural language. By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09851v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] coTherapist: A Behavior-Aligned Small Language Model to Support Mental Healthcare Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10246</link><description>arXiv:2601.10246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Access to mental healthcare is increasingly strained by workforce shortages and rising demand, motivating the development of intelligent systems that can support mental healthcare experts. We introduce coTherapist, a unified framework utilizing a small language model to emulate core therapeutic competencies through domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, and agentic reasoning. Evaluation on clinical queries demonstrates that coTherapist generates more relevant and clinically grounded responses than contemporary baselines. Using our novel T-BARS rubric and psychometric profiling, we confirm coTherapist exhibits high empathy and therapist-consistent personality traits. Furthermore, human evaluation by domain experts validates that coTherapist delivers accurate, trustworthy, and safe responses. coTherapist was deployed and tested by clinical experts. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that small models can be engineered to exhibit expert-like behavior, offering a scalable pathway for digital mental health tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10246v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning Hijacking: Subverting LLM Classification via Decision-Criteria Injection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10294</link><description>arXiv:2601.10294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current LLM safety research predominantly focuses on mitigating Goal Hijacking, preventing attackers from redirecting a model's high-level objective (e.g., from "summarizing emails" to "phishing users"). In this paper, we argue that this perspective is incomplete and highlight a critical vulnerability in Reasoning Alignment. We propose a new adversarial paradigm: Reasoning Hijacking and instantiate it with Criteria Attack, which subverts model judgments by injecting spurious decision criteria without altering the high-level task goal. Unlike Goal Hijacking, which attempts to override the system prompt, Reasoning Hijacking accepts the high-level goal but manipulates the model's decision-making logic by injecting spurious reasoning shortcut. Though extensive experiments on three different tasks (toxic comment, negative review, and spam detection), we demonstrate that even newest models are prone to prioritize injected heuristic shortcuts over rigorous semantic analysis. The results are consistent over different backbones. Crucially, because the model's "intent" remains aligned with the user's instructions, these attacks can bypass defenses designed to detect goal deviation (e.g., SecAlign, StruQ), exposing a fundamental blind spot in the current safety landscape.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10402v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] iTIMO: An LLM-empowered Synthesis Dataset for Travel Itinerary Modification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10609</link><description>arXiv:2601.10609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing itinerary modification is crucial for enhancing the travel experience as it is a frequent requirement during traveling. However, existing research mainly focuses on fixed itinerary planning, leaving modification underexplored due to the scarcity of need-to-modify itinerary data. To bridge this gap, we formally define the itinerary modification task and propose a general pipeline to construct the corresponding dataset, namely iTIMO. This pipeline frames the generation of need-to-modify itinerary data as an intent-driven perturbation task. It instructs large language models to perturb real-world itineraries using three operations: REPLACE, ADD, and DELETE. Each perturbation is grounded in three intents: disruptions of popularity, spatial distance, and category diversity. Furthermore, hybrid evaluation metrics are introduced to ensure perturbation effectiveness. We conduct comprehensive benchmarking on iTIMO to analyze the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs. Overall, iTIMO provides a comprehensive testbed for the modification task, and empowers the evolution of traditional travel recommender systems into adaptive frameworks capable of handling dynamic travel needs.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10940v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Big Ban Theory: A Pre- and Post-Intervention Dataset of Online Content Moderation Actions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11128</link><description>arXiv:2601.11128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online platforms rely on moderation interventions to curb harmful behavior such hate speech, toxicity, and the spread of mis- and disinformation. Yet research on the effects and possible biases of such interventions faces multiple limitations. For example, existing works frequently focus on single or a few interventions, due to the absence of comprehensive datasets. As a result, researchers must typically collect the necessary data for each new study, which limits opportunities for systematic comparisons. To overcome these challenges, we introduce The Big Ban Theory (TBBT), a large dataset of moderation interventions. TBBT covers 25 interventions of varying type, severity, and scope, comprising in total over 339K users and nearly 39M posted messages. For each intervention, we provide standardized metadata and pseudonymized user activity collected three months before and after its enforcement, enabling consistent and comparable analyses of intervention effects. In addition, we provide a descriptive exploratory analysis of the dataset, along with several use cases of how it can support research on content moderation. With this dataset, we aim to support researchers studying the effects of moderation interventions and to promote more systematic, reproducible, and comparable research.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown strong performance in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but their robustness under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations remains poorly understood. We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests - including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts - to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1,000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11428v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do LLMs Give Good Romantic Relationship Advice?

This study investigated how people evaluate advice on LLM-generated romantic relationships. Participants rated advice satisfaction, model reliability, and helpfulness, and completed pre- and post-measures of their general attitudes toward LLMs. Overall, the results showed participants' high satisfaction with LLM-generated advice. Greater satisfaction was, in turn, strongly and positively associated with their perceptions of the models' reliability and helpfulness. Importantly, participants' attitudes toward LLMs improved significantly after exposure to the advice, suggesting that supportive and contextually relevant advice can enhance users' trust and openness toward these AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11527v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Efficient and Explainable KAN Framework for Wireless Radiation Field Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11656</link><description>arXiv:2601.11656v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Frontier AI is becoming critical societal infrastructure, but outsiders lack reliable ways to judge whether leading developers' safety and security claims are accurate and whether their practices meet relevant standards. Compared to other social and technological systems we rely on daily such as consumer products, corporate financial statements, and food supply chains, AI is subject to less rigorous third-party scrutiny along several dimensions. Ambiguity about whether AI systems are trustworthy can discourage deployment in some contexts where the technology could be beneficial, and make it more likely when it's dangerous. Public transparency alone cannot close this gap: many safety- and security-relevant details are legitimately confidential and require expert interpretation. We define frontier AI auditing as rigorous third-party verification of frontier AI developers' safety and security claims, and evaluation of their systems and practices against relevant standards, based on deep, secure access to non-public information. To make rigor legible and comparable, we introduce AI Assurance Levels (AAL-1 to AAL-4), ranging from time-bounded system audits to continuous, deception-resilient verification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11699v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SolarGPT-QA: A Domain-Adaptive Large Language Model for Educational Question Answering in Space Weather and Heliophysics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12131</link><description>arXiv:2601.12131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar activity, including solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and geomagnetic storms, can significantly impact satellites, aviation, power grids, data centers, and space missions. Extreme solar events can cause substantial economic damage with limited advance warning, underscoring the importance of early-warning systems, accurate forecasting, and effective education in space science. Although large language models (LLMs) perform well on general tasks, they often lack domain-specific knowledge and pedagogical capability to clearly explain complex space science concepts. We introduce SolarGPT-QA, a question answering system based on a domain-adapted large language model built on the LLaMA-3 base model. The model is trained using scientific literature and large-scale question-answer data generated with GPT-4 and refined using Grok-3 in a student-friendly storytelling style. Human pairwise evaluations show that SolarGPT-QA outperforms general-purpose models in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance compared to instruction-tuned models for educational explanations in space weather and heliophysics. A small pilot student comprehension study further suggests improved clarity and accessibility of the generated explanations. Ablation experiments indicate that combining domain-adaptive pretraining with pedagogical fine-tuning is important for balancing scientific accuracy and educational effectiveness. This work represents an initial step toward a broader SolarGPT framework for space science education and forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12131v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Joint Learning for Domain and Class Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12253</link><description>arXiv:2601.12253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of visual-language models like CLIP has become crucial due to their large-scale parameter size and extensive pretraining requirements. Existing methods typically address either the issue of unseen classes or unseen domains in isolation, without considering a joint framework for both. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Fed}erated Joint Learning for \textbf{D}omain and \textbf{C}lass \textbf{G}eneralization, termed \textbf{FedDCG}, a novel approach that addresses both class and domain generalization in federated learning settings. Our method introduces a domain grouping strategy where class-generalized networks are trained within each group to prevent decision boundary confusion. During inference, we aggregate class-generalized results based on domain similarity, effectively integrating knowledge from both class and domain generalization. Specifically, a learnable network is employed to enhance class generalization capabilities, and a decoupling mechanism separates general and domain-specific knowledge, improving generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments across various datasets show that \textbf{FedDCG} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12253v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Discovering 100+ Compiler Defects in 72 Hours via LLM-Driven Semantic Logic Recomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12360</link><description>arXiv:2601.12360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compilers constitute the foundational root-of-trust in software supply chains; however, their immense complexity inevitably conceals critical defects. Recent research has attempted to leverage historical bugs to design new mutation operators or fine-tune models to increase program diversity for compiler fuzzing.We observe, however, that bugs manifest primarily based on the semantics of input programs rather than their syntax. Unfortunately, current approaches, whether relying on syntactic mutation or general Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, struggle to preserve the specific semantics found in the logic of bug-triggering programs. Consequently, these critical semantic triggers are often lost, resulting in a limitation of the diversity of generated programs.
  To explicitly reuse such semantics, we propose FeatureFuzz, a compiler fuzzer that combines features to generate programs. We define a feature as a decoupled primitive that encapsulates a natural language description of a bug-prone invariant, such as an out-of-bounds array access, alongside a concrete code witness of its realization. FeatureFuzz operates via a three-stage workflow: it first extracts features from historical bug reports, synthesizes coherent groups of features, and finally instantiates these groups into valid programs for compiler fuzzing.
  We evaluated FeatureFuzz on GCC and LLVM. Over 24-hour campaigns, FeatureFuzz uncovered 167 unique crashes, which is 2.78x more than the second-best fuzzer. Furthermore, through a 72-hour fuzzing campaign, FeatureFuzz identified 113 bugs in GCC and LLVM, 97 of which have already been confirmed by compiler developers, validating the approach's ability to stress-test modern compilers effectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12360v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking the AI Scientist: Interactive Multi-Agent Workflows for Scientific Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12542</link><description>arXiv:2601.12542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems for scientific discovery have demonstrated remarkable potential, yet existing approaches remain largely proprietary and operate in batch-processing modes requiring hours per research cycle, precluding real-time researcher guidance. This paper introduces Deep Research, a multi-agent system enabling interactive scientific investigation with turnaround times measured in minutes. The architecture comprises specialized agents for planning, data analysis, literature search, and novelty detection, unified through a persistent world state that maintains context across iterative research cycles.

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict the outcomes of legal cases based on factual descriptions, serving as a fundamental task to advance the development of legal systems. Traditional methods often rely on statistical analyses or role-based simulations but face challenges with multiple allegations, diverse evidence, and lack adaptability. In this paper, we introduce JurisMMA, a novel framework for LJP that effectively decomposes trial tasks, standardizes processes, and organizes them into distinct stages. Furthermore, we build JurisMM, a large dataset with over 100,000 recent Chinese judicial records, including both text and multimodal video-text data, enabling comprehensive evaluation. Experiments on JurisMM and the benchmark LawBench validate our framework's effectiveness. These results indicate that our framework is effective not only for LJP but also for a broader range of legal applications, offering new perspectives for the development of future legal methods and datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12815v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-generated data contamination erodes pathological variability and diagnostic reliability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12946</link><description>arXiv:2601.12946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly populating medical records with synthetic content, creating a feedback loop where future models are increasingly at risk of training on uncurated AI-generated data. However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12946v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Group Relative Policy Optimization for Robust Blind Interference Alignment with Fluid Antennas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13506</link><description>arXiv:2601.13506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) leverages dynamic reconfigurability to unlock spatial degrees of freedom and reshape wireless channels. Blind interference alignment (BIA) aligns interference through antenna switching. This paper proposes, for the first time, a robust fluid antenna-driven BIA framework for a K-user MISO downlink under imperfect channel state information (CSI). We formulate a robust sum-rate maximization problem through optimizing fluid antenna positions (switching positions). To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we employ group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm that eliminates the critic network. This robust design reduces model size and floating point operations (FLOPs) by nearly half compared to proximal policy optimization (PPO) while significantly enhancing performance through group-based exploration that escapes bad local optima. Simulation results demonstrate that GRPO outperforms PPO by 4.17%, and a 100K-step pre-trained PPO by 30.29%. Due to error distribution learning, GRPO exceeds heuristic MaximumGain and RandomGain by 200.78% and 465.38%, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13506v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI IDEs or Autonomous Agents?

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based coding agents increasingly act as autonomous contributors that generate and merge pull requests, yet their real-world effects on software projects are unclear-especially compared with widely adopted IDE-based AI assistants. We present a longitudinal causal study of agent adoption in open-source repositories using staggered difference-in-differences with matched controls. Using the AIDev dataset, we define adoption as the first agent-generated pull request and analyze monthly repository-level outcomes spanning development velocity (commits, lines added) and software quality (static-analysis warnings, cognitive complexity, duplication, and comment density). Results show large, front-loaded velocity gains only when agents are the first observable AI tool in a project; repositories with prior AI IDE usage experience minimal or short-lived throughput increases. In contrast, quality risks are persistent across settings, with static-analysis warnings and cognitive complexity rising by roughly 18% and 39%, indicating sustained agent-induced technical debt even when velocity advantages fade. These heterogeneous effects suggest diminishing returns to AI assistance and highlight the need for quality safeguards, provenance tracking, and selective deployment of autonomous agents. Our findings establish an empirical basis for understanding how agentic and IDE-based tools interact, and motivate research on balancing acceleration with maintainability in AI-integrated development workflows.

Abstract: Existing dynamic Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks mostly place language models in a passive role: the model reads a sequence of connected scenarios and reports what people believe, feel, intend, and do as these states change. In real social interaction, ToM is also used for action: a speaker plans what to say in order to shift another person's mental-state trajectory toward a goal. We introduce SocialMindChange, a benchmark that moves from tracking minds to changing minds in social interaction. Each instance defines a social context with 4 characters and five connected scenes. The model plays one character and generates dialogue across the five scenes to reach the target while remaining consistent with the evolving states of all participants. SocialMindChange also includes selected higher-order states. Using a structured four-step framework, we construct 1,200 social contexts, covering 6000 scenarios and over 90,000 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Evaluations on ten state-of-the-art LLMs show that their average performance is 54.2% below human performance. This gap suggests that current LLMs still struggle to maintain and change mental-state representations across long, linked interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13687v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human Simulation Computation: A Human-Inspired Framework for Adaptive AI Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13887</link><description>arXiv:2601.13887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in knowledge representation and reasoning based on textual data. However, their reliance on language material alone limits their ability to adapt, verify reasoning outcomes, and operate effectively in open and dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose Human Simulation Computation (HSC), a human-inspired computational framework that models intelligence as a continuous, closed-loop process involving thinking, action, learning, reflection, and activity scheduling, collectively referred to as the internal reasoning process. HSC emphasizes active participation both within the internal reasoning process and in interactions with the environment, where actions are used not only to achieve goals but also to automatically refine and improve internal reasoning mechanisms without external intervention. Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis, we argue that human simulation strategies cannot be fully learned from language material alone, and that human-like reasoning processes and action-grounded reasoning methods are essential for robust adaptation and effective interaction with real-world environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13887v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Truth with a Twist: The Rhetoric of Persuasion in Professional vs. Community-Authored Fact-Checks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14105</link><description>arXiv:2601.14105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the first large-scale comparison of persuasion techniques present in crowd- versus professionally-written debunks. Using extensive datasets from Community Notes (CNs), EUvsDisinfo, and the Database of Known Fakes (DBKF), we quantify the prevalence and types of persuasion techniques across these fact-checking ecosystems. Contrary to prior hypothesis that community-produced debunks rely more heavily on subjective or persuasive wording, we find no evidence that CNs contain a higher average number of persuasion techniques than professional fact-checks. We additionally identify systematic rhetorical differences between CNs and professional debunking efforts, reflecting differences in institutional norms and topical coverage. Finally, we examine how the crowd evaluates persuasive language in CNs and show that, although notes with more persuasive elements receive slightly higher overall helpfulness ratings, crowd raters are effective at penalising the use of particular problematic rhetorical means</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14105v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] APEX-Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14242</link><description>arXiv:2601.14242v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Agentic workflows that use autonomous AI Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers is rapidly rising. This introduces challenges in scalable cloud deployment and state management. Traditional hosting on Virtual Machines (VMs) is resource-intensive and lacks elasticity. Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer modularity, autoscaling and cost efficiency but are inherently stateless. In this paper, we present the FAME, a FaaS-based architecture for orchestrating MCP-enabled agentic workflows. FAME decomposes agentic patterns such as ReAct into composable agents: Planner, Actor and Evaluator, that are each a FaaS function built using LangGraph and are orchestrated as a FaaS workflow. This enables modular composition as AWS Step Functions and avoids function timeouts seen for monolithic agentic workflows. To address context persistence across user requests in a conversation, FAME automates agent memory persistence and injection using DynamoDB. It also optimizes MCP server deployment through AWS Lambda wrappers, caches tool outputs in S3 and proposes function fusion strategies. We evaluate FAME on two representative applications, on research paper summarization and log analytics, under diverse memory and caching configurations. Results show up to 13x latency reduction, 88% fewer input tokens and 66% in cost savings, along with improved workflow completion rates. This demonstrates the viability of serverless platforms for hosting complex, multi-agent AI workflows at scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14735v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARISE -- Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Scenario Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14743</link><description>arXiv:2601.14743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effectiveness of collision-free trajectory planners depends on the quality and diversity of training data, especially for rare scenarios. A widely used approach to improve dataset diversity involves generating realistic synthetic traffic scenarios. However, producing such scenarios remains difficult due to the precision required when scripting them manually or generating them in a single pass. Natural language offers a flexible way to describe scenarios, but existing text-to-simulation pipelines often rely on static snippet retrieval, limited grammar, single-pass decoding, or lack robust executability checks. Moreover, they depend heavily on constrained LLM prompting with minimal post-processing. To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE - Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Scenario Engineering, a multi-stage tool that converts natural language prompts into executable Scenic scripts through iterative LLM-guided refinement. After each generation, ARISE tests script executability in simulation software, feeding structured diagnostics back to the LLM until both syntactic and functional requirements are met. This process significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. Through extensive evaluation, ARISE outperforms the baseline in generating semantically accurate and executable traffic scenarios with greater reliability and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14743v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LangForce: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15197</link><description>arXiv:2601.15197v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose LangForce, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\pi(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, LangForce significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15197v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can We Trust LLM Detectors?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15301</link><description>arXiv:2601.15301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLMs has increased the need for reliable AI text detection, yet existing detectors often fail outside controlled benchmarks. We systematically evaluate 2 dominant paradigms (training-free and supervised) and show that both are brittle under distribution shift, unseen generators, and simple stylistic perturbations. To address these limitations, we propose a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) framework that learns discriminative style embeddings. Experiments show that while supervised detectors excel in-domain, they degrade sharply out-of-domain, and training-free methods remain highly sensitive to proxy choice. Overall, our results expose fundamental challenges in building domain-agnostic detectors.

Abstract: Real-world scientific applications frequently encounter incomplete observational data due to sensor limitations, geographic constraints, or measurement costs. Although neural operators significantly advanced PDE solving in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, their underlying assumption of fully-observed spatial inputs severely restricts applicability in real-world applications. We introduce the first systematic framework for learning neural operators from partial observation. We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator(LANO) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space. Additionally, we develop POBench-PDE, a dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for evaluating neural operators under partial observation conditions across three PDE-governed tasks. LANO achieves state-of-the-art performance with 18--69$\%$ relative L2 error reduction across all benchmarks under patch-wise missingness with less than 50$\%$ missing rate, including real-world climate prediction. Our approach effectively addresses practical scenarios involving up to 75$\%$ missing rate, to some extent bridging the existing gap between idealized research settings and the complexities of real-world scientific computing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15547v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dancing in Chains: Strategic Persuasion in Academic Rebuttal via Theory of Mind</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15715</link><description>arXiv:2601.15715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although artificial intelligence (AI) has become deeply integrated into various stages of the research workflow and achieved remarkable advancements, academic rebuttal remains a significant and underexplored challenge. This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental form of data structure. The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15751v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LL-GaussianMap: Zero-shot Low-Light Image Enhancement via 2D Gaussian Splatting Guided Gain Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15766</link><description>arXiv:2601.15766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in low-light image enhancement with respect to visual quality. However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that LL-GaussianMap achieves superior enhancement performance with an extremely low storage footprint, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit Gaussian representations for image enhancement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15766v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can professional translators identify machine-generated text?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15828</link><description>arXiv:2601.15828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates whether professional translators can reliably identify short stories generated in Italian by artificial intelligence (AI) without prior specialized training. Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported. In contrast, features such as grammatical accuracy and emotional tone frequently led to misclassification. These findings raise questions about the role and scope of synthetic-text editing in professional contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15828v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distillation-based Layer Dropping (DLD): Effective End-to-end Framework for Dynamic Speech Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16117</link><description>arXiv:2601.16117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge devices operate in constrained and varying resource settings, requiring dynamic architectures that can adapt to limitations of the available resources. To meet such demands, layer dropping ($\mathcal{LD}$) approach is typically used to transform static models into dynamic ones by skipping parts of the network along with reducing overall computational complexity. However, existing $\mathcal{LD}$ methods greatly impact the dynamic model's performance for low and high dropping cases, deteriorating the performance-computation trade-off. To this end, we propose a distillation-based layer dropping (DLD) framework that effectively combines the capabilities of knowledge distillation and $\mathcal{LD}$ in an end-to-end fashion, thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance for dynamic speech networks. Comprehensive experimentation utilizing well-known speech recognition methods, including conformer and WavLM, on three public benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework, reducing the word error rate by $9.32\%$ and $2.25\%$ for high and no dropping cases with $33.3\%$ reduction in training time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16117v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Gaussian process learning via subspace projections</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16332</link><description>arXiv:2601.16332v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Environments are the bottleneck for self-improving agents. Current terminal benchmarks were built for evaluation, not training; reinforcement learning requires a scalable pipeline, not just a dataset. We introduce Endless Terminals, a fully autonomous pipeline that procedurally generates terminal-use tasks without human annotation. The pipeline has four stages: generating diverse task descriptions, building and validating containerized environments, producing completion tests, and filtering for solvability. From this pipeline we obtain 3255 tasks spanning file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database operations. We train agents using vanilla PPO with binary episode level rewards and a minimal interaction loop: no retrieval, multi-agent coordination, or specialized tools. Despite this simplicity, models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains: on our held-out dev set, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 4.0% to 18.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 10.7% to 53.3%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 42.6% to 59.0%. These improvements transfer to human-curated benchmarks: models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains on held out human curated benchmarks: on TerminalBench 2.0, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 0.0% to 2.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 2.2% to 3.4%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 1.1% to 6.7%, in each case outperforming alternative approaches including models with more complex agentic scaffolds. These results demonstrate that simple RL succeeds when environments scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16443v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cutting the Gordian Knot: Detecting Malicious PyPI Packages via a Knowledge-Mining Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16463</link><description>arXiv:2601.16463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Python Package Index (PyPI) has become a target for malicious actors, yet existing detection tools generate false positive rates of 15-30%, incorrectly flagging one-third of legitimate packages as malicious. This problem arises because current tools rely on simple syntactic rules rather than semantic understanding, failing to distinguish between identical API calls serving legitimate versus malicious purposes. To address this challenge, we propose PyGuard, a knowledge-driven framework that converts detection failures into useful behavioral knowledge by extracting patterns from existing tools' false positives and negatives. Our method utilizes hierarchical pattern mining to identify behavioral sequences that distinguish malicious from benign code, employs Large Language Models to create semantic abstractions beyond syntactic variations, and combines this knowledge into a detection system that integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning. PyGuard achieves 99.50% accuracy with only 2 false positives versus 1,927-2,117 in existing tools, maintains 98.28% accuracy on obfuscated code, and identified 219 previously unknown malicious packages in real-world deployment. The behavioral patterns show cross-ecosystem applicability with 98.07% accuracy on NPM packages, demonstrating that semantic understanding enables knowledge transfer across programming languages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16463v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA: A Benchmark for Logical Commonsense Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16504</link><description>arXiv:2601.16504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commonsense reasoning often involves evaluating multiple plausible interpretations rather than selecting a single atomic answer, yet most benchmarks rely on single-label evaluation, obscuring whether statements are jointly plausible, mutually exclusive, or jointly implausible. We introduce LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA, a benchmark that re-frames commonsense reasoning as logical composition over pairs of atomic statements using plausibility-level operators (AND, OR, NEITHER/NOR). Evaluating instruction-tuned, reasoning-specialized, and fine-tuned models under zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, we find that while models perform reasonably on conjunctive and moderately on disjunctive reasoning, performance degrades sharply on negation-based questions. LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA exposes fundamental reasoning limitations and provides a controlled framework for advancing compositional commonsense reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16504v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Startup Success Using Large Language Models: A Novel In-Context Learning Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16568</link><description>arXiv:2601.16568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Venture capital (VC) investments in early-stage startups that end up being successful can yield high returns. However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16568v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dual-Prototype Disentanglement: A Context-Aware Enhancement Framework for Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16632</link><description>arXiv:2601.16632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series forecasting has witnessed significant progress with deep learning. While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16632v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GTA: Generative Traffic Agents for Simulating Realistic Mobility Behavior</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16778</link><description>arXiv:2601.16778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People's transportation choices reflect complex trade-offs shaped by personal preferences, social norms, and technology acceptance. Predicting such behavior at scale is a critical challenge with major implications for urban planning and sustainable transport. Traditional methods use handcrafted assumptions and costly data collection, making them impractical for early-stage evaluations of new technologies or policies. We introduce Generative Traffic Agents (GTA) for simulating large-scale, context-sensitive transportation choices using LLM-powered, persona-based agents. GTA generates artificial populations from census-based sociodemographic data. It simulates activity schedules and mode choices, enabling scalable, human-like simulations without handcrafted rules. We evaluate GTA in Berlin-scale experiments, comparing simulation results against empirical data. While agents replicate patterns, such as modal split by socioeconomic status, they show systematic biases in trip length and mode preference. GTA offers new opportunities for modeling how future innovations, from bike lanes to transit apps, shape mobility decisions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16778v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Atomic Depth Estimation From Noisy Electron Microscopy Data Via Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17046</link><description>arXiv:2601.17046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for extracting 3D atomic-level information from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images affected by significant noise.

Our experiments show that the resulting depth estimates are accurate, calibrated and robust to noise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17046v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] iFSQ: Improving FSQ for Image Generation with 1 Line of Code</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17124</link><description>arXiv:2601.17124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of image generation is currently bifurcated into autoregressive (AR) models operating on discrete tokens and diffusion models utilizing continuous latents. This divide, rooted in the distinction between VQ-VAEs and VAEs, hinders unified modeling and fair benchmarking. Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) offers a theoretical bridge, yet vanilla FSQ suffers from a critical flaw: its equal-interval quantization can cause activation collapse. This mismatch forces a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and information efficiency. In this work, we resolve this dilemma by simply replacing the activation function in original FSQ with a distribution-matching mapping to enforce a uniform prior. Termed iFSQ, this simple strategy requires just one line of code yet mathematically guarantees both optimal bin utilization and reconstruction precision. Leveraging iFSQ as a controlled benchmark, we uncover two key insights: (1) The optimal equilibrium between discrete and continuous representations lies at approximately 4 bits per dimension. (2) Under identical reconstruction constraints, AR models exhibit rapid initial convergence, whereas diffusion models achieve a superior performance ceiling, suggesting that strict sequential ordering may limit the upper bounds of generation quality. Finally, we extend our analysis by adapting Representation Alignment (REPA) to AR models, yielding LlamaGen-REPA.

Abstract: Small-molecule identification from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) remains a bottleneck in untargeted settings where spectral libraries are incomplete. While deep learning offers a solution, current approaches typically fall into two extremes: explicit generative models that construct molecular graphs atom-by-atom, or joint contrastive models that learn cross-modal subspaces from scratch. We introduce SpecBridge, a novel implicit alignment framework that treats structure identification as a geometric alignment problem. SpecBridge fine-tunes a self-supervised spectral encoder (DreaMS) to project directly into the latent space of a frozen molecular foundation model (ChemBERTa), and then performs retrieval by cosine similarity to a fixed bank of precomputed molecular embeddings. Across MassSpecGym, Spectraverse, and MSnLib benchmarks, SpecBridge improves top-1 retrieval accuracy by roughly 20-25% relative to strong neural baselines, while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. These results suggest that aligning to frozen foundation models is a practical, stable alternative to designing new architectures from scratch. The code for SpecBridge is released at https://github.com/HassounLab/SpecBridge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17204v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Power-based Partial Attention: Bridging Linear-Complexity and Full Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17334</link><description>arXiv:2601.17334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely accepted from transformer research that "attention is all we need", but the amount of attention required has never been systematically quantified. Is quadratic $O(L^2)$ attention necessary, or is there a sub-quadratic attention mechanism that can achieve comparable performance? To answer this question, we introduce power-based partial attention (PPA), an attention mechanism of order $O(L^{1+p})$, where $0 \leq p \leq 1$, such that $p=0$ corresponds to sliding window attention with linear complexity, and $p=1$ corresponds to full attention. With this attention construction, we can explore how transformer architecture performance varies as a function of the attention scaling behavior controlled by $p$. The overall trend from our experiments shows an S-curve-like behavior where the performance transitions from sliding-window (linear-complexity) attention to full attention over a narrow window of $p$ values, and plateaus as $p$ approaches $1$. In our experiments, we show that there exists $0&lt;p&gt;&lt;1$ such that $O(L^{1+p})$ attention is sufficient to achieve similar results as $O(L^2)$ full attention.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17334v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Numerical Study of Dissipative Weak Solutions for the Euler Equations of Gas Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17452</link><description>arXiv:2601.17452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dissipative weak (DW) solutions of the Euler equations of gas dynamics using the first-, second-, third-, fifth-, seventh-, and ninth-order local characteristic decomposition-based central-upwind (LCDCU), low-dissipation central-upwind (LDCU), and viscous finite volume (VFV) methods, whose higher-order extensions are obtained via the framework of the alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) schemes. These methods are applied to several benchmark problems, including several two-dimensional Riemann problems and a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability test. The numerical results demonstrate that for methods converging only weakly in space and time, the limiting solutions are generalized DW solutions, approximated in the sense of ${\cal K}$-convergence and dependent on the numerical scheme. For all of the studied methods, we compute the associated Young measures and compare the DW solutions using entropy production and energy defect criteria.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17452v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Will It Zero-Shot?: Predicting Zero-Shot Classification Performance For Arbitrary Queries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17535</link><description>arXiv:2601.17535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models like CLIP create aligned embedding spaces for text and images, making it possible for anyone to build a visual classifier by simply naming the classes they want to distinguish. However, a model that works well in one domain may fail in another, and non-expert users have no straightforward way to assess whether their chosen VLM will work on their problem. We build on prior work using text-only comparisons to evaluate how well a model works for a given natural language task, and explore approaches that also generate synthetic images relevant to that task to evaluate and refine the prediction of zero-shot accuracy. We show that generated imagery to the baseline text-only scores substantially improves the quality of these predictions. Additionally, it gives a user feedback on the kinds of images that were used to make the assessment. Experiments on standard CLIP benchmark datasets demonstrate that the image-based approach helps users predict, without any labeled examples, whether a VLM will be effective for their application.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17535v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How AI Coding Agents Modify Code: A Large-Scale Study of GitHub Pull Requests</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17581</link><description>arXiv:2601.17581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI coding agents are increasingly acting as autonomous contributors by generating and submitting pull requests (PRs). However, we lack empirical evidence on how these agent-generated PRs differ from human contributions, particularly in how they modify code and describe their changes. Understanding these differences is essential for assessing their reliability and impact on development workflows. Using the MSR 2026 Mining Challenge version of the AIDev dataset, we analyze 24,014 merged Agentic PRs (440,295 commits) and 5,081 merged Human PRs (23,242 commits). We examine additions, deletions, commits, and files touched, and evaluate the consistency between PR descriptions and their diffs using lexical and semantic similarity. Agentic PRs differ substantially from Human PRs in commit count (Cliff's $\delta = 0.5429$) and show moderate differences in files touched and deleted lines. They also exhibit slightly higher description-to-diff similarity across all measures. These findings provide a large-scale empirical characterization of how AI coding agents contribute to open source development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17581v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Memento: Towards Proactive Visualization of Everyday Memories with Personal Wearable AR Assistant</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17622</link><description>arXiv:2601.17622v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: The growing adoption of multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) pipelines for vision-centric tasks (e.g. visual QA) introduces important privacy challenges. In particular, while mRAG provides a practical capability to connect private datasets to improve model performance, it risks the leakage of private information from these datasets during inference. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to analyze the privacy risks inherent in the mRAG pipeline observed through standard model prompting. Specifically, we implement a case study that attempts to infer the inclusion of a visual asset, e.g. image, in the mRAG, and if present leak the metadata, e.g. caption, related to it. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms and motivate future research on mRAG privacy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17644v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The LLM Data Auditor: A Metric-oriented Survey on Quality and Trustworthiness in Evaluating Synthetic Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17717</link><description>arXiv:2601.17717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating data across various modalities. By transforming data from a scarce resource into a controllable asset, LLMs mitigate the bottlenecks imposed by the acquisition costs of real-world data for model training, evaluation, and system iteration. However, ensuring the high quality of LLM-generated synthetic data remains a critical challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on generation methodologies, with limited direct attention to the quality of the resulting data. Furthermore, most studies are restricted to single modalities, lacking a unified perspective across different data types. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{LLM Data Auditor framework}. In this framework, we first describe how LLMs are utilized to generate data across six distinct modalities. More importantly, we systematically categorize intrinsic metrics for evaluating synthetic data from two dimensions: quality and trustworthiness. This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations for the community to improve the evaluation of data generation. Finally, the framework outlines methodologies for the practical application of synthetic data across different modalities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17717v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Script is All You Need: An Agentic Framework for Long-Horizon Dialogue-to-Cinematic Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17737</link><description>arXiv:2601.17737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have produced models capable of synthesizing stunning visual content from simple text prompts. However, these models struggle to generate long-form, coherent narratives from high-level concepts like dialogue, revealing a ``semantic gap'' between a creative idea and its cinematic execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel, end-to-end agentic framework for dialogue-to-cinematic-video generation. Central to our framework is ScripterAgent, a model trained to translate coarse dialogue into a fine-grained, executable cinematic script. To enable this, we construct ScriptBench, a new large-scale benchmark with rich multimodal context, annotated via an expert-guided pipeline. The generated script then guides DirectorAgent, which orchestrates state-of-the-art video models using a cross-scene continuous generation strategy to ensure long-horizon coherence. Our comprehensive evaluation, featuring an AI-powered CriticAgent and a new Visual-Script Alignment (VSA) metric, shows our framework significantly improves script faithfulness and temporal fidelity across all tested video models. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a crucial trade-off in current SOTA models between visual spectacle and strict script adherence, providing valuable insights for the future of automated filmmaking.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17737v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MV-S2V: Multi-View Subject-Consistent Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17756</link><description>arXiv:2601.17756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing Subject-to-Video Generation (S2V) methods have achieved high-fidelity and subject-consistent video generation, yet remain constrained to single-view subject references. This limitation renders the S2V task reducible to an S2I + I2V pipeline, failing to exploit the full potential of video subject control. In this work, we propose and address the challenging Multi-View S2V (MV-S2V) task, which synthesizes videos from multiple reference views to enforce 3D-level subject consistency. Regarding the scarcity of training data, we first develop a synthetic data curation pipeline to generate highly customized synthetic data, complemented by a small-scale real-world captured dataset to boost the training of MV-S2V. Another key issue lies in the potential confusion between cross-subject and cross-view references in conditional generation. To overcome this, we further introduce Temporally Shifted RoPE (TS-RoPE) to distinguish between different subjects and distinct views of the same subject in reference conditioning. Our framework achieves superior 3D subject consistency w.r.t. multi-view reference images and high-quality visual outputs, establishing a new meaningful direction for subject-driven video generation.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data, such as the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN), are pre-trained on a massive number of synthetic datasets generated by structural causal models (SCM). They leverage in-context learning to offer high predictive accuracy in real-world tasks. However, the fairness properties of these foundational models, which incorporate ideas from causal reasoning during pre-training, remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of TabPFN and its fine-tuned variants, assessing predictive performance, fairness, and robustness across varying dataset sizes and distributional shifts. Our results reveal that while TabPFN achieves stronger predictive accuracy compared to baselines and exhibits robustness to spurious correlations, improvements in fairness are moderate and inconsistent, particularly under missing-not-at-random (MNAR) covariate shifts. These findings suggest that the causal pre-training in TabPFN is helpful but insufficient for algorithmic fairness, highlighting implications for deploying TabPFN (and similar) models in practice and the need for further fairness interventions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17912v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Streaming-dLLM: Accelerating Diffusion LLMs via Suffix Pruning and Dynamic Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17917</link><description>arXiv:2601.17917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer a compelling paradigm for natural language generation, leveraging parallel decoding and bidirectional attention to achieve superior global coherence compared to autoregressive models. While recent works have accelerated inference via KV cache reuse or heuristic decoding, they overlook the intrinsic inefficiencies within the block-wise diffusion process. Specifically, they suffer from spatial redundancy by modeling informative-sparse suffix regions uniformly and temporal inefficiency by applying fixed denoising schedules across all the decoding process. To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, we introduce attenuation guided suffix modeling to approximate the full context by pruning redundant mask tokens. Temporally, we employ a dynamic confidence aware strategy with an early exit mechanism, allowing the model to skip unnecessary iterations for converged tokens. Extensive experiments show that Streaming-dLLM achieves up to 68.2X speedup while maintaining generation quality, highlighting its effectiveness in diffusion decoding.

Abstract: Reconstructing human dynamic visual perception from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is of great research significance since EEG's non-invasiveness and high temporal resolution. However, EEG-to-video reconstruction remains challenging due to: 1) Single Modality: existing studies solely align EEG signals with the text modality, which ignores other modalities and are prone to suffer from overfitting problems; 2) Data Scarcity: current methods often have difficulty training to converge with limited EEG-video data. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel framework MindCine to achieve high-fidelity video reconstructions on limited data. We employ a multimodal joint learning strategy to incorporate beyond-text modalities in the training stage and leverage a pre-trained large EEG model to relieve the data scarcity issue for decoding semantic information, while a Seq2Seq model with causal attention is specifically designed for decoding perceptual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, the results underscore the effectiveness of the complementary strengths of different modalities and demonstrate that leveraging a large-scale EEG model can further enhance reconstruction performance by alleviating the challenges associated with limited data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18192v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UTune: Towards Uncertainty-Aware Online Index Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18199</link><description>arXiv:2601.18199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There have been a flurry of recent proposals on learned benefit estimators for index tuning. Although these learned estimators show promising improvement over what-if query optimizer calls in terms of the accuracy of estimated index benefit, they face significant limitations when applied to online index tuning, an arguably more common and more challenging scenario in real-world applications. There are two major challenges for learned index benefit estimators in online tuning: (1) limited amount of query execution feedback that can be used to train the models, and (2) constant coming of new unseen queries due to workload drifts. The combination of the two hinders the generalization capability of existing learned index benefit estimators. To overcome these challenges, we present UTune, an uncertainty-aware online index tuning framework that employs operator-level learned models with improved generalization over unseen queries. At the core of UTune is an uncertainty quantification mechanism that characterizes the inherent uncertainty of the operator-level learned models given limited online execution feedback. We further integrate uncertainty information into index selection and configuration enumeration, the key component of any index tuner, by developing a new variant of the classic $\epsilon$-greedy search strategy with uncertainty-weighted index benefits. Experimental evaluation shows that UTune not only significantly improves the workload execution time compared to state-of-the-art online index tuners but also reduces the index exploration overhead, resulting in faster convergence when the workload is relatively stable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18199v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DMAP: Human-Aligned Structural Document Map for Multimodal Document Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18203</link><description>arXiv:2601.18203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing multimodal document question-answering (QA) systems predominantly rely on flat semantic retrieval, representing documents as a set of disconnected text chunks and largely neglecting their intrinsic hierarchical and relational structures. Such flattening disrupts logical and spatial dependencies - such as section organization, figure-text correspondence, and cross-reference relations, that humans naturally exploit for comprehension. To address this limitation, we introduce a document-level structural Document MAP (DMAP), which explicitly encodes both hierarchical organization and inter-element relationships within multimodal documents. Specifically, we design a Structured-Semantic Understanding Agent to construct DMAP by organizing textual content together with figures, tables, charts, etc. into a human-aligned hierarchical schema that captures both semantic and layout dependencies. Building upon this representation, a Reflective Reasoning Agent performs structure-aware and evidence-driven reasoning, dynamically assessing the sufficiency of retrieved context and iteratively refining answers through targeted interactions with DMAP. Extensive experiments on MMDocQA benchmarks demonstrate that DMAP yields document-specific structural representations aligned with human interpretive patterns, substantially enhancing retrieval precision, reasoning consistency, and multimodal comprehension over conventional RAG-based approaches.

Abstract: Recently, the frontier of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities has shifted from single-turn code generation to agentic software engineering-a paradigm where models autonomously navigate, edit, and test complex repositories. While post-training methods have become the de facto approach for code agents, **agentic mid-training**-mid-training (MT) on large-scale data that mirrors authentic agentic workflows-remains critically underexplored due to substantial resource requirements, despite offering a more scalable path to instilling foundational agentic behaviors than relying solely on expensive reinforcement learning. A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity. We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`. We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe `Kimi-Dev` under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B).

Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are increasingly implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs) to leverage parallel processing capabilities for enhanced efficiency. However, existing studies largely emphasize the raw speedup obtained by porting individual algorithms from CPUs to GPUs. Consequently, these studies offer limited insight into when and why GPU parallelism fundamentally benefits EAs. To address this gap, we investigate how GPU parallelism alters the behavior of EAs beyond simple acceleration metrics. We conduct a systematic empirical study of 16 representative EAs on 30 benchmark problems. Specifically, we compare CPU and GPU executions across a wide range of problem dimensionalities and population sizes. Our results reveal that the impact of GPU acceleration is highly heterogeneous and depends strongly on algorithmic structure. We further demonstrate that conventional fixed-budget evaluation based on the number of function evaluations (FEs) is inadequate for GPU execution. In contrast, fixed-time evaluation uncovers performance characteristics that are unobservable under small or practically constrained FE budgets, particularly for adaptive and exploration-oriented algorithms. Moreover, we identify distinct scaling regimes in which GPU parallelism is beneficial, saturates, or degrades as problem dimensionality and population size increase. Crucially, we show that large populations enabled by GPUs not only improve hardware utilization but also reveal algorithm-specific convergence and diversity dynamics that are difficult to observe under CPU-constrained settings. Consequently, our findings indicate that GPU parallelism is not strictly an implementation detail, but a pivotal factor that influences how EAs should be evaluated, compared, and designed for modern computing platforms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18446v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nearly Optimal Bayesian Inference for Structural Missingness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18500</link><description>arXiv:2601.18500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural missingness breaks 'just impute and train': values can be undefined by causal or logical constraints, and the mask may depend on observed variables, unobserved variables (MNAR), and other missingness indicators. It simultaneously brings (i) a catch-22 situation with causal loop, prediction needs the missing features, yet inferring them depends on the missingness mechanism, (ii) under MNAR, the unseen are different, the missing part can come from a shifted distribution, and (iii) plug-in imputation, a single fill-in can lock in uncertainty and yield overconfident, biased decisions. In the Bayesian view, prediction via the posterior predictive distribution integrates over the full model posterior uncertainty, rather than relying on a single point estimate. This framework decouples (i) learning an in-model missing-value posterior from (ii) label prediction by optimizing the predictive posterior distribution, enabling posterior integration. This decoupling yields an in-model almost-free-lunch: once the posterior is learned, prediction is plug-and-play while preserving uncertainty propagation. It achieves SOTA on 43 classification and 15 imputation benchmarks, with finite-sample near Bayes-optimality guarantees under our SCM prior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18500v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast and Safe Trajectory Optimization for Mobile Manipulators With Neural Configuration Space Distance Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18548</link><description>arXiv:2601.18548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile manipulators promise agile, long-horizon behavior by coordinating base and arm motion, yet whole-body trajectory optimization in cluttered, confined spaces remains difficult due to high-dimensional nonconvexity and the need for fast, accurate collision reasoning. Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDF) enable fixed-base manipulators to model collisions directly in configuration space via smooth, implicit distances. This representation holds strong potential to bypass the nonlinear configuration-to-workspace mapping while preserving accurate whole-body geometry and providing optimization-friendly collision costs. Yet, extending this capability to mobile manipulators is hindered by unbounded workspaces and tighter base-arm coupling. We lift this promise to mobile manipulation with Generalized Configuration Space Distance Fields (GCDF), extending CDF to robots with both translational and rotational joints in unbounded workspaces with tighter base-arm coupling. We prove that GCDF preserves Euclidean-like local distance structure and accurately encodes whole-body geometry in configuration space, and develop a data generation and training pipeline that yields continuous neural GCDFs with accurate values and gradients, supporting efficient GPU-batched queries. Building on this representation, we develop a high-performance sequential convex optimization framework centered on GCDF-based collision reasoning. The solver scales to large numbers of implicit constraints through (i) online specification of neural constraints, (ii) sparsity-aware active-set detection with parallel batched evaluation across thousands of constraints, and (iii) incremental constraint management for rapid replanning under scene changes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18548v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LaCoGSEA: Unsupervised deep learning for pathway analysis via latent correlation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18604</link><description>arXiv:2601.18604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: Pathway enrichment analysis is widely used to interpret gene expression data. Standard approaches, such as GSEA, rely on predefined phenotypic labels and pairwise comparisons, which limits their applicability in unsupervised settings. Existing unsupervised extensions, including single-sample methods, provide pathway-level summaries but primarily capture linear relationships and do not explicitly model gene-pathway associations. More recently, deep learning models have been explored to capture non-linear transcriptomic structure. However, their interpretation has typically relied on generic explainable AI (XAI) techniques designed for feature-level attribution. As these methods are not designed for pathway-level interpretation in unsupervised transcriptomic analyses, their effectiveness in this setting remains limited.
  Results: To bridge this gap, we introduce LaCoGSEA (Latent Correlation GSEA), an unsupervised framework that integrates deep representation learning with robust pathway statistics. LaCoGSEA employs an autoencoder to capture non-linear manifolds and proposes a global gene-latent correlation metric as a proxy for differential expression, generating dense gene rankings without prior labels. We demonstrate that LaCoGSEA offers three key advantages: (i) it achieves improved clustering performance in distinguishing cancer subtypes compared to existing unsupervised baselines; (ii) it recovers a broader range of biologically meaningful pathways at higher ranks compared with linear dimensionality reduction and gradient-based XAI methods; and (iii) it maintains high robustness and consistency across varying experimental protocols and dataset sizes. Overall, LaCoGSEA provides state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised pathway enrichment analysis.

Abstract: The precise regulation of rotary actuation is fundamental in autonomous robotics, yet practical PID loops deviate from continuous-time theory due to discrete-time execution, actuator saturation, and small delays and measurement imperfections. We present an implementation-aware analysis and tuning workflow for saturated discrete-time joint control. We (i) derive PI stability regions under Euler and exact zero-order-hold (ZOH) discretizations using the Jury criterion, (ii) evaluate a discrete back-calculation anti-windup realization under saturation-dominant regimes, and (iii) propose a hybrid-certified Bayesian optimization workflow that screens analytically unstable candidates and behaviorally unsafe transients while optimizing a robust IAE objective with soft penalties on overshoot and saturation duty. Baseline sweeps ($\tau=1.0$~s, $\Delta t=0.01$~s, $u\in[-10,10]$) quantify rise/settle trends for P/PI/PID. Under a randomized model family emulating uncertainty, delay, noise, quantization, and tighter saturation, robustness-oriented tuning improves median IAE from $0.843$ to $0.430$ while keeping median overshoot below $2\%$. In simulation-only tuning, the certification screen rejects $11.6\%$ of randomly sampled gains within bounds before full robust evaluation, improving sample efficiency without hardware experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18639v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TwinPurify: Purifying gene expression data to reveal tumor-intrinsic transcriptional programs via self-supervised learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18640</link><description>arXiv:2601.18640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies have transformed tumor ecosystem profiling at cellular resolution. However, large scale studies on patient cohorts continue to rely on bulk transcriptomic data, where variation in tumor purity obscures tumor-intrinsic transcriptional signals and constrains downstream discovery. Many deconvolution methods report strong performance on synthetic bulk mixtures but fail to generalize to real patient cohorts because of unmodeled biological and technical variation.
  Here, we introduce TwinPurify, a representation learning framework that adapts the Barlow Twins self-supervised objective, representing a fundamental departure from the deconvolution paradigm. Rather than resolving the bulk mixture into discrete cell-type fractions, TwinPurify instead learns continuous, high-dimensional tumor embeddings by leveraging adjacent-normal profiles within the same cohort as "background" guidance, enabling the disentanglement of tumor-specific signals without relying on any external reference.
  Benchmarked against multiple large cancer cohorts across RNA-seq and microarray platforms, TwinPurify outperforms conventional representation learning baselines like auto-encoders in recovering tumor-intrinsic and immune signals. The purified embeddings improve molecular subtype and grade classification, enhance survival model concordance, and uncover biologically meaningful pathway activities compared to raw bulk profiles. By providing a transferable framework for decontaminating bulk transcriptomics, TwinPurify extends the utility of existing clinical datasets for molecular discovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18640v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Anticipation Before Action: EEG-Based Implicit Intent Detection for Adaptive Gaze Interaction in Mixed Reality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18750</link><description>arXiv:2601.18750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) interfaces increasingly rely on gaze for interaction , yet distinguishing visual attention from intentional action remains difficult, leading to the Midas Touch problem. Existing solutions require explicit confirmations, while brain-computer interfaces may provide an implicit marker of intention using Stimulus-Preceding Negativity (SPN). We investigated how Intention (Select vs. Observe) and Feedback (With vs. Without) modulate SPN during gaze-based MR interactions. During realistic selection tasks, we acquired EEG and eye-tracking data from 28 participants. SPN was robustly elicited and sensitive to both factors: observation without feedback produced the strongest amplitudes, while intention to select and expectation of feedback reduced activity, suggesting SPN reflects anticipatory uncertainty rather than motor preparation. Complementary decoding with deep learning models achieved reliable person-dependent classification of user intention, with accuracies ranging from 75% to 97% across participants. These findings identify SPN as an implicit marker for building intention-aware MR interfaces that mitigate the Midas Touch.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18750v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chaotic Hedging with Iterated Integrals and Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10166</link><description>arXiv:2209.10166v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an $L^p$-chaos expansion based on iterated Stratonovich integrals with respect to a given exponentially integrable continuous semimartingale. By omitting the orthogonality of the expansion, we show that every $p$-integrable functional, $p \in [1,\infty)$, can be approximated by a finite sum of iterated Stratonovich integrals. Using (possibly random) neural networks as integrands, we therefere obtain universal approximation results for $p$-integrable financial derivatives in the $L^p$-sense. Moreover, we can approximately solve the $L^p$-hedging problem (coinciding for $p = 2$ with the quadratic hedging problem), where the approximating hedging strategy can be computed in closed form within short runtime.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2209.10166v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hedonic Prices and Quality Adjusted Price Indices Powered by AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00044</link><description>arXiv:2305.00044v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop empirical models that efficiently process large amounts of unstructured product data (text, images, prices, quantities) to produce accurate hedonic price estimates and derived indices. To achieve this, we generate abstract product attributes (or ``features'') from descriptions and images using deep neural networks. These attributes are then used to estimate the hedonic price function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we apply the models to Amazon's data for first-party apparel sales, and estimate hedonic prices. The resulting models have a very high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ ranging from $80\%$ to $90\%$. Finally, we construct the AI-based hedonic Fisher price index, chained at the year-over-year frequency, and contrast it with the CPI and other electronic indices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2305.00044v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Classical Attention: Quantum Attention for Scalable Computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08045</link><description>arXiv:2307.08045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance across various tasks, attention-driven models have profoundly transformed the field of machine learning. Since attention computations account for the primary computational overhead in both model inference and training, efficiently computing attention matrices has become one of the core challenges in accelerating large language models. It is well-known that quantum machines possess computational advantages over classical machines, and the role of quantum computing in LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on leveraging the Grover search algorithm to efficiently compute a sparse attention matrix. Through comparisons with classical algorithms, we demonstrate that our method achieves quantum acceleration in polynomial time. Additionally, we observe that the generated quantum attention matrices naturally exhibit low-rank structures, providing further theoretical support for efficient modeling. Moreover, within the specific context of attention matrix computation, we conduct a systematic and detailed analysis of the error and time complexity of the proposed algorithm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2307.08045v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond the noise: intrinsic dimension estimation with optimal neighbourhood identification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15132</link><description>arXiv:2405.15132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Intrinsic Dimension (ID) is a key concept in unsupervised learning and feature selection, as it is a lower bound to the number of variables which are necessary to describe a system. However, in almost any real-world dataset the ID depends on the scale at which the data are analysed. Quite typically at a small scale, the ID is very large, as the data are affected by measurement errors. At large scale, the ID can also be erroneously large, due to the curvature and the topology of the manifold containing the data. In this work, we introduce an automatic protocol to select the sweet spot, namely the correct range of scales in which the ID is meaningful and useful. This protocol is based on imposing that for distances smaller than the correct scale the density of the data is constant. In the presented framework, to estimate the density it is necessary to know the ID, therefore, this condition is imposed self-consistently. We illustrate the usefulness and robustness of this procedure to noise by benchmarks on artificial and real-world datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.15132v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synchronization on circles and spheres with nonlinear interactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18273</link><description>arXiv:2405.18273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of $n$ points on a sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \geq 2$) which attract each other according to a function $\varphi$ of their inner products. When $\varphi$ is linear ($\varphi(t) = t$), the points converge to a common value (i.e., synchronize) in various connectivity scenarios: this is part of classical work on Kuramoto oscillator networks. When $\varphi$ is exponential ($\varphi(t) = e^{\beta t}$), these dynamics correspond to a limit of how idealized transformers process data, as described by Geshkovski et al. (2025). Accordingly, they ask whether synchronization occurs for exponential $\varphi$.
  The answer depends on the dimension $d$. In the context of consensus for multi-agent control, Markdahl et al. (2018) show that for $d \geq 3$ (spheres), if the interaction graph is connected and $\varphi$ is increasing and convex, then the system synchronizes. We give a separate proof of this result.
  What is the situation on circles ($d=2$)? First, we show that $\varphi$ being increasing and convex is no longer sufficient (even for complete graphs). Then we identify a new condition under which we do have synchronization on the circle (namely, if the Taylor coefficients of $\varphi'$ are decreasing). As a corollary, this provide synchronization for exponential $\varphi$ with $\beta \in (0, 1]$. The proofs are based on nonconvex landscape analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.18273v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Algebraic power series and their automatic complexity modulo prime powers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00750</link><description>arXiv:2408.00750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Christol and, independently, Denef and Lipshitz showed that an algebraic sequence of $p$-adic integers (or integers) is $p$-automatic when reduced modulo $p^\alpha$. Previously, the best known bound on the minimal automaton size for such a sequence was doubly exponential in $\alpha$. Under mild conditions, we improve this bound to the order of $p^{\alpha^3 h d}$, where $h$ and $d$ are the height and degree of the minimal annihilating polynomial modulo $p$. We achieve this bound by showing that all states in the automaton are naturally represented in a new numeration system. This significantly restricts the set of possible states. Since our approach embeds algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions, we also obtain bounds more generally for diagonals of multivariate rational functions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.00750v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowledge-enhanced Pretraining for Vision-language Pathology Foundation Model on Cancer Diagnosis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13126</link><description>arXiv:2412.13126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have shown great promise in computational pathology but remain primarily data-driven, lacking explicit integration of medical knowledge. We introduce KEEP (KnowledgE-Enhanced Pathology), a foundation model that systematically incorporates disease knowledge into pretraining for cancer diagnosis. KEEP leverages a comprehensive disease knowledge graph encompassing 11,454 diseases and 139,143 attributes to reorganize millions of pathology image-text pairs into 143,000 semantically structured groups aligned with disease ontology hierarchies. This knowledge-enhanced pretraining aligns visual and textual representations within hierarchical semantic spaces, enabling deeper understanding of disease relationships and morphological patterns. Across 18 public benchmarks (over 14,000 whole-slide images) and 4 institutional rare cancer datasets (926 cases), KEEP consistently outperformed existing foundation models, showing substantial gains for rare subtypes. These results establish knowledge-enhanced vision-language modeling as a powerful paradigm for advancing computational pathology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.13126v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why Do Speech Language Models Fail to Generate Semantically Coherent Outputs?

Abstract: Although text-based large language models exhibit human-level writing ability and remarkable intelligence, speech language models (SLMs) still struggle to generate semantically coherent outputs. There are several potential reasons for this performance degradation: (A) speech tokens mainly provide phonetic information rather than semantic information, (B) the length of speech sequences is much longer than that of text sequences, and (C) paralinguistic information, such as prosody, introduces additional complexity and variability. In this paper, we explore the influence of three key factors separately by transiting the modality from text to speech in an evolving manner. Our findings reveal that the impact of the three factors varies. Factor A has a relatively minor impact, factor B influences syntactical and semantic modeling more obviously, and factor C exerts the most significant impact, particularly in the basic lexical modeling. Based on these findings, we provide insights into the unique challenges of training SLMs and highlight pathways to develop more effective end-to-end SLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.17048v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convergence of energy-based learning in linear resistive networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00349</link><description>arXiv:2503.00349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

This convergence result is then extended to a stochastic variant of Contrastive Learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.00349v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Secrecy Performance of a Keyhole-based Multi-user System with Multiple Eavesdroppers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02506</link><description>arXiv:2504.02506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the secrecy performance of a keyhole-aided multi-user communication network in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. The communication happens through the same keyhole for legitimate users and eavesdroppers. In this context, the secrecy performance is evaluated for a user scheduling technique by obtaining the exact closed-form expression of secrecy outage probability (SOP). Further, a simplified asymptotic SOP expression is derived assuming high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario for a better understanding of the impact of system parameters. The effect of the keyhole parameters, number of users, number of eavesdroppers, and threshold secrecy rate on the SOP performance are also investigated for the considered system model. In the high-SNR regime, the asymptotic SOP saturates to a constant value and does not depend on the keyhole parameter and the channel parameter of the source-to-keyhole channel.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.02506v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feasibility of Primality in Bounded Arithmetic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17041</link><description>arXiv:2504.17041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the correctness of the AKS algorithm \cite{AKS} within the bounded arithmetic theory $T^{count}_2$ or, equivalently, the first-order consequences of the theory $VTC^0$ expanded by the smash function, which we denote by $VTC^0_2$. Our approach initially demonstrates the correctness within the theory $S^1_2 + iWPHP$ augmented by two algebraic axioms and then show that they are provable in $VTC^0_2$. The two axioms are: a generalized version of Fermat's Little Theorem and an axiom adding a new function symbol which injectively maps roots of polynomials over a definable finite field to numbers bounded by the degree of the given polynomial. To obtain our main result, we also give new formalizations of parts of number theory and algebra:
  $\bullet$ In $PV_1$: We formalize Legendre's Formula on the prime factorization of $n!$, key properties of the Combinatorial Number System and the existence of cyclotomic polynomials over the finite fields $\mathbb{Z}/p$.
  $\bullet$ In $S^1_2$: We prove the inequality $lcm(1,\dots, 2n) \geq 2^n$.
  $\bullet$ In $VTC^0$: We verify the correctness of the Kung--Sieveking algorithm for polynomial division.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.17041v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EDM2SE: A Magnitude-Preserving Network Architecture for Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05216</link><description>arXiv:2505.05216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study diffusion-based speech enhancement using a Schrodinger bridge formulation and extend the EDM2 framework to this setting. We employ time-dependent preconditioning of network inputs and outputs to stabilize training and explore two skip-connection configurations that allow the network to predict either environmental noise or clean speech. To control activation and weight magnitudes, we adopt a magnitude-preserving architecture and learn the contribution of the noisy input within each network block for improved conditioning. We further analyze the impact of exponential moving average (EMA) parameter smoothing by approximating different EMA profiles post training, finding that, unlike in image generation, short or absent EMA consistently yields better speech enhancement performance. Experiments on VoiceBank-DEMAND and EARS-WHAM demonstrate competitive signal-to-distortion ratios and perceptual scores, with the two skip-connection variants exhibiting complementary strengths. These findings provide new insights into EMA behavior, magnitude preservation, and skip-connection design for diffusion-based speech enhancement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.05216v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Global Minimizers of $\ell^p$-Regularized Objectives Yield the Sparsest ReLU Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21791</link><description>arXiv:2505.21791v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks can interpolate a given dataset in many different ways, prompting the fundamental question: which among these solutions should we prefer, and what explicit regularization strategies will provably yield these solutions? This paper addresses the challenge of finding the sparsest interpolating ReLU network--i.e., the network with the fewest nonzero parameters or neurons--a goal with wide-ranging implications for efficiency, generalization, interpretability, theory, and model compression. Unlike post hoc pruning approaches, we propose a continuous, almost-everywhere differentiable training objective whose global minima are guaranteed to correspond to the sparsest single-hidden-layer ReLU networks that fit the data. This result marks a conceptual advance: it recasts the combinatorial problem of sparse interpolation as a smooth optimization task, potentially enabling the use of gradient-based training methods. Our objective is based on minimizing $\ell^p$ quasinorms of the weights for $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$, a classical sparsity-promoting strategy in finite-dimensional settings. However, applying these ideas to neural networks presents new challenges: the function class is infinite-dimensional, and the weights are learned using a highly nonconvex objective. We prove that, under our formulation, global minimizers correspond exactly to sparsest solutions. Our work lays a foundation for understanding when and how continuous sparsity-inducing objectives can be leveraged to recover sparse networks through training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.21791v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00452</link><description>arXiv:2506.00452v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing-based approaches, such as linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural network (DNN)-based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a model-based DNN framework that learns the linear MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE performs channel estimation through a single linear operation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To improve the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder that captures the frequency and temporal correlation structure of OFDM channels. We also introduce a rank-adaptive extension that enables a flexible performance-complexity trade-off. Numerical simulations show that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension provide an improved performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful and highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.00452v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Confidence intervals for forced alignment boundaries using model ensembles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01256</link><description>arXiv:2506.01256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order statistics. Having confidence intervals provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the boundary placement, facilitating tasks like finding boundaries that should be reviewed. As a bonus, on the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a slight overall improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals can be emitted during the alignment process as JSON files and a main table for programmatic and statistical analysis. For familiarity, they are also output as Praat TextGrids using a point tier to represent the intervals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.01256v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoding Cortical Microcircuits: A Generative Model for Latent Space Exploration and Controlled Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11062</link><description>arXiv:2506.11062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial neural networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.11062v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Single Index Bandits: Generalized Linear Contextual Bandits with Unknown Reward Functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12751</link><description>arXiv:2506.12751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized linear bandits have been extensively studied due to their broad applicability in real-world online decision-making problems. However, these methods typically assume that the expected reward function is known to the users, an assumption that is often unrealistic in practice. Misspecification of this link function can lead to the failure of all existing algorithms. In this work, we address this critical limitation by introducing a new problem of generalized linear bandits with unknown reward functions, also known as single index bandits. We first consider the case where the unknown reward function is monotonically increasing, and propose two novel and efficient algorithms, STOR and ESTOR, that achieve decent regrets under standard assumptions. Notably, our ESTOR can obtain the nearly optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$ in terms of the time horizon $T$. We then extend our methods to the high-dimensional sparse setting and show that the same regret rate can be attained with the sparsity index. Next, we introduce GSTOR, an algorithm that is agnostic to general reward functions, and establish regret bounds under a Gaussian design assumption. Finally, we validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.12751v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Assessing metadata privacy in neuroimaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15278</link><description>arXiv:2509.15278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ethical and legal imperative to share research data without causing harm requires careful attention to privacy risks. While mounting evidence demonstrates that data sharing benefits science, legitimate concerns persist regarding the potential leakage of personal information that could lead to reidentification and subsequent harm. We reviewed metadata accompanying neuroimaging datasets from heterogeneous studies openly available on OpenNeuro, involving participants across the lifespan, from children to older adults, with and without clinical diagnoses, and including associated clinical score data. Using metaprivBIDS (https://github.com/CPernet/metaprivBIDS), a software application for BIDS compliant tsv/json files that computes and reports different privacy metrics (k-anonymity, k-global, l-diversity, SUDA, PIF), we found that privacy is generally well maintained, with serious vulnerabilities being rare. Nonetheless, issues were identified in nearly all datasets and warrant mitigation. Notably, clinical score data (e.g., neuropsychological results) posed minimal reidentification risk, whereas demographic variables: age, sex assigned at birth, sexual orientations, race, income, and geolocation, represented the principal privacy vulnerabilities. We outline practical measures to address these risks, enabling safer data sharing practices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.15278v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bilateral Distribution Compression: Reducing Both Data Size and Dimensionality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17543</link><description>arXiv:2509.17543v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods reduce the number of observations in a dataset by minimising the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between original and compressed sets, but modern datasets are often large in both sample size and dimensionality. We propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that compresses along both axes while preserving the underlying distribution, with overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which we introduce to quantify the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD, guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original distribution. Experiments show that BDC can achieve comparable or superior downstream task performance to ambient-space compression at substantially lower cost and with significantly higher rates of compression.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.17543v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SoundCompass: Navigating Target Sound Extraction With Effective Directional Clue Integration In Complex Acoustic Scenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18561</link><description>arXiv:2509.18561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in target sound extraction (TSE) utilize directional clues derived from direction of arrival (DoA), which represent an inherent spatial property of sound available in any acoustic scene. However, previous DoA-based methods rely on hand-crafted features or discrete encodings, which lose fine-grained spatial information and limit adaptability. We propose SoundCompass, an effective directional clue integration framework centered on a Spectral Pairwise INteraction (SPIN) module that captures cross-channel spatial correlations in the complex spectrogram domain to preserve full spatial information in multichannel signals. The input feature expressed in terms of spatial correlations is fused with a DoA clue represented as spherical harmonics (SH) encoding. The fusion is carried out across overlapping frequency subbands, inheriting the benefits reported in the previous band-split architectures. We also incorporate the iterative refinement strategy, chain-of-inference (CoI), in the TSE framework, which recursively fuses DoA with sound event activation estimated from the previous inference stage. Experiments demonstrate that SoundCompass, combining SPIN, SH embedding, and CoI, robustly extracts target sources across diverse signal classes and spatial configurations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.18561v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Structure: Invariant Crystal Property Prediction with Pseudo-Particle Ray Diffraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21778</link><description>arXiv:2509.21778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-range atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is openly available at https://github.com/Bin-Cao/PRDNet.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21778v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Concept activation vectors: a unifying view and adversarial attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22755</link><description>arXiv:2509.22755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are a tool from explainable AI, offering a promising approach for understanding how human-understandable concepts are encoded in a model's latent spaces. They are computed from hidden-layer activations of inputs belonging either to a concept class or to non-concept examples. Adopting a probabilistic perspective, the distribution of the (non-)concept inputs induces a distribution over the CAV, making it a random vector in the latent space. This enables us to derive mean and covariance for different types of CAVs, leading to a unified theoretical view. This probabilistic perspective also reveals a potential vulnerability: CAVs can strongly depend on the rather arbitrary non-concept distribution, a factor largely overlooked in prior work. We illustrate this with a simple yet effective adversarial attack, underscoring the need for a more systematic study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22755v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chat to Chip: Large Language Model Based Design of Arbitrarily Shaped Metasurfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24196</link><description>arXiv:2509.24196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional metasurface design is limited by the computational cost of full-wave simulations, preventing thorough exploration of complex configurations. Data-driven approaches have emerged as a solution to this bottleneck, replacing costly simulations with rapid neural network evaluations and enabling near-instant design for meta-atoms. Despite advances, implementing a new optical function still requires building and training a task-specific network, along with exhaustive searches for suitable architectures and hyperparameters. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs), by contrast, sidestep this laborious process with a simple fine-tuning technique. However, applying LLMs to the design of nanophotonic devices, particularly for arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces, is still in its early stages; as such tasks often require graphical networks. Here, we show that an LLM, fed with descriptive inputs of arbitrarily shaped metasurface geometries, can learn the physical relationships needed for spectral prediction and inverse design. We further benchmarked a range of open-weight LLMs and identified relationships between accuracy and model size at the billion-parameter level. We demonstrated that 1-D token-wise LLMs provide a practical tool to designing 2-D arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces. Linking natural-language interaction to electromagnetic modelling, this "chat-to-chip" workflow represents a step toward more user-friendly data-driven nanophotonics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24196v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised lexicon learning from speech is limited by representations rather than clustering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09225</link><description>arXiv:2510.09225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems aim to tokenise speech into word-like units without access to text labels. Despite progress, the induced lexicons are still far from perfect. In an idealised setting with gold word boundaries, we ask whether performance is limited by the representation of word segments, or by the clustering methods that group them into word-like types. We combine a range of self-supervised speech features (continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods (K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features. Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences. Through controlled experiments that isolate either the representations or the clustering method, we demonstrate that representation variability across segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering -- is the primary factor limiting performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.09225v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HYPERDOA: Robust and Efficient DoA Estimation using Hyperdimensional Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10718</link><description>arXiv:2510.10718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off, as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems. We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies -- Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline, and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and "black-box" nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for mission-critical applications on edge devices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.10718v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Doubly-Regressing Approach for Subgroup Fairness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21091</link><description>arXiv:2510.21091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic fairness is a socially crucial topic in real-world applications of AI.
  Among many notions of fairness, subgroup fairness is widely studied when multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age) are present.
  However, as the number of sensitive attributes grows, the number of subgroups increases accordingly, creating heavy computational burdens and data sparsity problem (subgroups with too small sizes).
  In this paper, we develop a novel learning algorithm for subgroup fairness which resolves these issues by focusing on subgroups with sufficient sample sizes as well as marginal fairness (fairness for each sensitive attribute).
  To this end, we formalize a notion of subgroup-subset fairness and introduce a corresponding distributional fairness measure called the supremum Integral Probability Metric (supIPM).
  Building on this formulation, we propose the Doubly Regressing Adversarial learning for subgroup Fairness (DRAF) algorithm, which reduces a surrogate fairness gap for supIPM with much less computation than directly reducing supIPM.
  Theoretically, we prove that the proposed surrogate fairness gap is an upper bound of supIPM.
  Empirically, we show that the DRAF algorithm outperforms baseline methods in benchmark datasets, specifically when the number of sensitive attributes is large so that many subgroups are very small.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.21091v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Attention Sinks and Massive Activations in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22603</link><description>arXiv:2510.22603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced auditory speech recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR), and audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR). However, understanding of their internal dynamics under fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through a detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token, thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling rates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.22603v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Twirlator: A Pipeline for Analyzing Subgroup Symmetry Effects in Quantum Machine Learning Ansatzes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04243</link><description>arXiv:2511.04243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is a strong inductive bias in geometric deep learning and its quantum counterpart, and has attracted increasing attention for improving the trainability of QML models. Yet incorporating symmetries into quantum machine learning (QML) ansatzes is not free: symmetrization often adds gates and constrains the circuits. To understand these effects, we present Twirlator, which is an automated pipeline that symmetrizes parameterized QML ansatzes and quantifies the trade-offs as the amount of symmetry increases. Twirlator models partial symmetries by the size of a subgroup of the symmetric group, enabling analysis between the ``no symmetry'' and ``full symmetry'' extremes. Across 19 common ansatz patterns, Twirlator symmetrizes circuits with respect to any subgroup of $S_n$ and measures (1) generator drift, (2) circuit overhead (depth and size), and (3) expressibility and entangling capability. The experimental evaluation focuses on subgroups of $S_4$ and $S_5$. Twirlator reveals that larger subgroups typically increase circuit overhead, reduce expressibility, and often increase entangling capability. The pipeline and results provide practical guidance for selecting ansatz patterns and symmetry levels that balance hardware cost and model performance in symmetry-aware QML applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.04243v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Omni-AVSR: Towards Unified Multimodal Speech Recognition with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07253</link><description>arXiv:2511.07253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in speech recognition across multiple modalities, including Auditory Speech Recognition (ASR), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.07253v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A general framework for adaptive nonparametric dimensionality reduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09486</link><description>arXiv:2511.09486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task in modern data science. Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09486v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Power Analysis is Essential: High-Powered Tests Suggest Minimal to No Effect of Rounded Shapes on Click-Through Rates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24521</link><description>arXiv:2512.24521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Underpowered studies (below 50%) suffer from the winner's curse: A statistically significant result must exaggerate the true treatment effect to meet the significance threshold. A study by Dipayan Biswas, Annika Abell, and Roger Chacko published in the Journal of Consumer Research (2023) reported that in an A/B test simply rounding the corners of square buttons increased the online click-through rate by 55% (p-value 0.037)$\unicode{x2014}$a striking finding with potentially wide-ranging implications for a digital industry that is seeking to enhance consumer engagement. Drawing on our experience with tens of thousands of A/B tests, many involving similar user interface modifications, we found this dramatic claim implausibly large. To evaluate the claim, and provide a more accurate estimate of the treatment effect, we conducted three high-powered A/B tests, each involving over two thousand times more users than the original study. All three experiments yielded effect size estimates that were approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than initially reported, with 95% confidence intervals that include zero, that is, not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Two additional independent replications by Evidoo found similarly small effects. These findings underscore the critical importance of power analysis and experimental design in increasing trust and reproducibility of results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24521v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stabilizer Code-Generic Universal Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10964</link><description>arXiv:2601.10964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error-correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10964v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KOCOBrain: Kuramoto-Guided Graph Network for Uncovering Structure-Function Coupling in Adolescent Prenatal Drug Exposure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11018</link><description>arXiv:2601.11018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exposure to psychoactive substances during pregnancy, such as cannabis, can disrupt neurodevelopment and alter large-scale brain networks, yet identifying their neural signatures remains challenging. We introduced KOCOBrain: KuramotO COupled Brain Graph Network; a unified graph neural network framework that integrates structural and functional connectomes via Kuramoto-based phase dynamics and cognition-aware attention. The Kuramoto layer models neural synchronization over anatomical connections, generating phase-informed embeddings that capture structure-function coupling, while cognitive scores modulate information routing in a subject-specific manner followed by a joint objective enhancing robustness under class imbalance scenario. Applied to the ABCD cohort, KOCOBrain improved prenatal drug exposure prediction over relevant baselines and revealed interpretable structure-function patterns that reflect disrupted brain network coordination associated with early exposure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11018v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Model-free policy gradient for discrete-time mean-field control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11217</link><description>arXiv:2601.11217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study model-free policy learning for discrete-time mean-field control (MFC) problems with finite state space and compact action space. In contrast to the extensive literature on value-based methods for MFC, policy-based approaches remain largely unexplored due to the intrinsic dependence of transition kernels and rewards on the evolving population state distribution, which prevents the direct use of likelihood-ratio estimators of policy gradients from classical single-agent reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow and prove that the gradient of the resulting perturbed value function converges to the true policy gradient as the perturbation magnitude vanishes. This construction yields a fully model-free estimator based solely on simulated trajectories and an auxiliary estimate of the sensitivity of the state distribution. Building on this framework, we develop MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm for MFC, and establish explicit quantitative bounds on its bias and mean-squared error. Numerical experiments on representative mean-field control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11217v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stream-Voice-Anon: Enhancing Utility of Real-Time Speaker Anonymization via Neural Audio Codec and Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13948</link><description>arXiv:2601.13948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protecting speaker identity is crucial for online voice applications, yet streaming speaker anonymization (SA) remains underexplored. Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios. Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13948v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Q-Probe: Scaling Image Quality Assessment to High Resolution via Context-Aware Agentic Probing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15356</link><description>arXiv:2601.15356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to achieve superior human preference alignment in Image Quality Assessment (IQA). However, existing RL-based IQA models typically rely on coarse-grained global views, failing to capture subtle local degradations in high-resolution scenarios. While emerging "Thinking with Images" paradigms enable multi-scale visual perception via zoom-in mechanisms, their direct adaptation to IQA induces spurious "cropping-implies-degradation" biases and misinterprets natural depth-of-field as artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Probe, the first agentic IQA framework designed to scale IQA to high resolution via context-aware probing. First, we construct Vista-Bench, a pioneering benchmark tailored for fine-grained local degradation analysis in high-resolution IQA settings. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns the model with human preferences, while simultaneously eliminating causal bias through a novel context-aware cropping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Probe achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution settings while maintaining superior efficacy across resolution scales.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15356v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Di-Graphs with tightly connected Clusters: Effective Graph Laplacians and Resolvent Convergence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18057</link><description>arXiv:2601.18057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study Laplacians on graphs for which connectivity within certain subgraphs tends to infinity. Our main focus are graphs sharing a common node set on which edge weights within certain clusters grow to infinity. As intra-cluster connectivity increases, we show that the corresponding graph Laplacians converge -- in the resolvent sense -- to an effective graph Laplacian. This effective limit Laplacian is defined on a coarsened graph, where each highly connected cluster is collapsed into a single node. In the undirected setting, the effective Laplacian arises naturally from aggregating over tightly connected clusters. In the directed case, the limiting graph structure depends on the precise manner in which connectivity increases; with the corresponding effects mediated by the left and right kernel structure of the Laplacian restricted to high-connectivity clusters. Our results shed light on the emergence of coarse-grained dynamics in large-scale networks and contribute to spectral graph theory of directed graphs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18057v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Adaptive Purification Controller for Quantum Networks: Dynamic Protocol Selection and Multipartite Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18351</link><description>arXiv:2601.18351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient entanglement distribution is the cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that autonomously optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the "goodput," the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocol families (e.g., BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results demonstrate that our approach eliminates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and prevents resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, demonstrating robustness for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, confirming real-time feasibility with decision latencies in the millisecond range per link.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18351v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Cost of Inflation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18544</link><description>arXiv:2601.18544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical evidence suggests that there is little to no correlation between the rate of inflation and the size of price change. Economists have hitherto taken this to mean that monetary shocks do not generate much deviation in relative prices and therefore inflation does not hurt the economy by impeding the workings of the price system. This paper presents a production network model of inflationary dynamics in which it is well possible for inflation to have near-zero correlation with the size of price change yet cause significant distortion of relative prices. The relative price distortion caused by inflation critically depends on the spectral gap, degree distribution, and assortativity of the production network.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18544v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TelcoAI: Advancing 3GPP Technical Specification Search through Agentic Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16984</link><description>arXiv:2601.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) produces complex technical specifications essential to global telecommunications, yet their hierarchical structure, dense formatting, and multi-modal content make them difficult to process.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) significantly improves accuracy on complex tasks, yet incurs excessive memory overhead due to the long think-stage sequences stored in the Key-Value (KV) cache. Unlike traditional generation tasks where all tokens are uniformly important, CoT emphasizes the final answer, rendering conventional KV compression strategies ineffective. In this paper, we present Crystal-KV, an efficient KV cache management framework tailored for CoT reasoning. Our key insight is the answer-first principle. By mapping answer preferences into think-stage attention map, we distinguish between SlipKV, which mainly maintains the reasoning flow but may occasionally introduce misleading context, and CrystalKV, which truly contributes to the correctness of the final answer. Next, we propose an attention-based Least Recently Frequently Used algorithm. It precisely identifies when a SlipKV entry's utility expires and evicts it, retaining CrystalKV without disrupting reasoning flow. Finally, we introduce an adaptive cache budget allocation algorithm. Based on the dynamic proportion of CrystalKV, it estimates the importance of each layer/head and adjusts the KV cache budget during inference, amplifying critical components to improve budget utilization. Results show that Crystal-KV achieves state-of-the-art KV cache compression, significantly improves throughput, and enables faster response time, while maintaining, or even improving, answer accuracy for CoT reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Reward Model Generalization via Pairwise Maximum Discrepancy Competitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16987</link><description>arXiv:2601.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models, yet their practical effectiveness hinges on generalization to unseen prompts and shifting distributions. Most existing RM evaluations rely on static, pre-annotated preference datasets, which provide limited coverage and often fail to faithfully assess generalization in open-world settings. We introduce Pairwise Maximum Discrepancy Competition (PMDC), a dynamic and annotation-efficient framework for evaluating RM generalization using a large, unlabeled, open-domain prompt pool. PMDC actively selects prompt--response pairs that maximize disagreement between two RMs, yielding a compact set of highly contentious test cases. These cases are adjudicated by an oracle, and the resulting outcomes are aggregated via a Bradley--Terry model to produce a global ranking and pairwise win-rate landscape of RMs. We apply PMDC to re-evaluate 10 representative RMs and observe substantial rank reshuffling compared with conventional benchmarks. Qualitative analyses further uncover systematic generalization failures, providing valuable insights for improving reward modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16987v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated Classification of Research Papers Toward Sustainable Development Goals: A Boolean Query-Based Computational Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16988</link><description>arXiv:2601.16988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of scholarly publications across diverse disciplines has made it increasingly difficult to systematically evaluate how research contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Domain classification of research articles done manually through research experts is extremely impractical because of the number of publications, expensive in time and may not be consistent when done by human beings. This paper proposes an automated and rule-based computational model of classifying research papers based on SDGs with expert curated Boolean query mappings to overcome these challenges. The proposed system has a web-based interface to input data and display results, a backend application programming interface to do high throughput processing, and a Python-based classification engine which uses structured Boolean expressions to process bibliographic metadata (titles, abstracts, and keywords). The framework can be used to support single-paper-based classification and batch-based classification as well as offer clear and understandable outputs that clearly show what query parts motivated each SDG assignment. The experimental testing on massive bibliographic data sets has shown that the system can process thousands of research records in an hour with reproducible and consistent results. The proposed approach provides a viable solution to institutions, researchers and policymakers who are interested in analysis of research alignment with the goal of sustainability in a systematic fashion that would not involve the use of machine learning models whose inputs and outputs are not easily understandable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16988v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] pyBiblioNet: a Python library for a comprehensive network-based bibliometric analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16990</link><description>arXiv:2601.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bibliometric analysis is a critical tool for understanding the structure, dynamics, and impact of scientific research. Traditional methods often fall short in capturing the intricate relationships and evolving trends within scientific literature. To address this gap, we present pyBiblioNet, a Python library designed to facilitate comprehensive network-based bibliometric analysis, providing insights into citation networks, co-authorship networks, and keyword co-occurrence networks. The library integrates with OpenAlex, a popular and open catalogue to the global research system, enabling users to easily preprocess, visualize, and analyse bibliometric data. Key features include topic selection, automatic data download via OpenAlex APIs, creation of the root and base sets of manuscripts to analyze, creation of the citation and co-authorship networks, network visualization tools, and a suite of algorithms for computing network centralities, clustering, and community detection, all of them tailored to the bibliometric domain. Additionally, it enables the analysis of key topics and concepts using NLP techniques. We showcase the main functions of the library by performing a bibliometric analysis on the multidisciplinary "15-minute city paradigm", demonstrating the utility of pyBiblioNet in uncovering hidden patterns and emerging trends in various scientific domains. pyBiblioNet can empower researchers, librarians, and policymakers with a powerful, user-friendly tool for enhancing their bibliometric analyses and making data-driven decisions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16990v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparsity-Aware Low-Rank Representation for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16991</link><description>arXiv:2601.16991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained language models to downstream tasks often entails fine-tuning millions of parameters or deploying costly dense weight updates, which hinders their use in resource-constrained environments. Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduces trainable parameters by factorizing weight updates, yet the underlying dense weights still impose high storage and computation costs. Magnitude-based pruning can yield sparse models but typically degrades LoRA's performance when applied naively. In this paper, we introduce SALR (Sparsity-Aware Low-Rank Representation), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that unifies low-rank adaptation with sparse pruning under a rigorous mean-squared-error framework. We prove that statically pruning only the frozen base weights minimizes the pruning error bound, and we recover the discarded residual information via a truncated-SVD low-rank adapter, which provably reduces per-entry MSE by a factor of $(1 - r/\min(d,k))$. To maximize hardware efficiency, we fuse multiple low-rank adapters into a single concatenated GEMM, and we adopt a bitmap-based encoding with a two-stage pipelined decoding + GEMM design to achieve true model compression and speedup. Empirically, SALR attains 50\% sparsity on various LLMs while matching the performance of LoRA on GSM8K and MMLU, reduces model size by $2\times$, and delivers up to a $1.7\times$ inference speedup.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16991v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BibAgent: An Agentic Framework for Traceable Miscitation Detection in Scientific Literature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16993</link><description>arXiv:2601.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citations are the bedrock of scientific authority, yet their integrity is compromised by widespread miscitations: ranging from nuanced distortions to fabricated references. Systematic citation verification is currently unfeasible; manual review cannot scale to modern publishing volumes, while existing automated tools are restricted by abstract-only analysis or small-scale, domain-specific datasets in part due to the "paywall barrier" of full-text access. We introduce BibAgent, a scalable, end-to-end agentic framework for automated citation verification. BibAgent integrates retrieval, reasoning, and adaptive evidence aggregation, applying distinct strategies for accessible and paywalled sources. For paywalled references, it leverages a novel Evidence Committee mechanism that infers citation validity via downstream citation consensus. To support systematic evaluation, we contribute a 5-category Miscitation Taxonomy and MisciteBench, a massive cross-disciplinary benchmark comprising 6,350 miscitation samples spanning 254 fields. Our results demonstrate that BibAgent outperforms state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) baselines in citation verification accuracy and interpretability, providing scalable, transparent detection of citation misalignments across the scientific literature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16993v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Dataset of Dengue Hospitalizations in Brazil (1999 to 2021) with Weekly Disaggregation from Monthly Counts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16994</link><description>arXiv:2601.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This data paper describes and publicly releases this dataset (v1.0.0), published on Zenodo under DOI 10.5281/zenodo.18189192. Motivated by the need to increase the temporal granularity of originally monthly data to enable more effective training of AI models for epidemiological forecasting, the dataset harmonizes municipal-level dengue hospitalization time series across Brazil and disaggregates them to weekly resolution (epidemiological weeks) through an interpolation protocol with a correction step that preserves monthly totals. The statistical and temporal validity of this disaggregation was assessed using a high-resolution reference dataset from the state of Sao Paulo (2024), which simultaneously provides monthly and epidemiological-week counts, enabling a direct comparison of three strategies: linear interpolation, jittering, and cubic spline. Results indicated that cubic spline interpolation achieved the highest adherence to the reference data, and this strategy was therefore adopted to generate weekly series for the 1999 to 2021 period. In addition to hospitalization time series, the dataset includes a comprehensive set of explanatory variables commonly used in epidemiological and environmental modeling, such as demographic density, CH4, CO2, and NO2 emissions, poverty and urbanization indices, maximum temperature, mean monthly precipitation, minimum relative humidity, and municipal latitude and longitude, following the same temporal disaggregation scheme to ensure multivariate compatibility. The paper documents the datasets provenance, structure, formats, licenses, limitations, and quality metrics (MAE, RMSE, R2, KL, JSD, DTW, and the KS test), and provides usage recommendations for multivariate time-series analysis, environmental health studies, and the development of machine learning and deep learning models for outbreak forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16994v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty Quantification for Named Entity Recognition via Full-Sequence and Subsequence Conformal Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16999</link><description>arXiv:2601.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) serves as a foundational component in many natural language processing (NLP) pipelines. However, current NER models typically output a single predicted label sequence without any accompanying measure of uncertainty, leaving downstream applications vulnerable to cascading errors. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for adapting sequence-labeling-based NER models to produce uncertainty-aware prediction sets. These prediction sets are collections of full-sentence labelings that are guaranteed to contain the correct labeling with a user-specified confidence level. This approach serves a role analogous to confidence intervals in classical statistics by providing formal guarantees about the reliability of model predictions. Our method builds on conformal prediction, which offers finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. We design efficient nonconformity scoring functions to construct efficient, well-calibrated prediction sets that support both unconditional and class-conditional coverage. This framework accounts for heterogeneity across sentence length, language, entity type, and number of entities within a sentence. Empirical experiments on four NER models across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the broad applicability, validity, and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16999v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Investigating Self-regulated Learning Sequences within a Generative AI-based Intelligent Tutoring System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17000</link><description>arXiv:2601.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing trend in employing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) techniques to support learning. Moreover, scholars have reached a consensus on the critical role of self-regulated learning (SRL) in ensuring learning effectiveness within GenAI-assisted learning environments, making it essential to capture students' dynamic SRL patterns. In this study, we extracted students' interaction patterns with GenAI from trace data as they completed a problem-solving task within a GenAI-assisted intelligent tutoring system. Students' purpose of using GenAI was also analyzed from the perspective of information processing, i.e., information acquisition and information transformation. Using sequential and clustering analysis, this study classified participants into two groups based on their SRL sequences. These two groups differed in the frequency and temporal characteristics of GenAI use. In addition, most students used GenAI for information acquisition rather than information transformation, while the correlation between the purpose of using GenAI and learning performance was not statistically significant.

Abstract: Twenty-five years ago, Joel Reidenberg argued that technology itself, not just law and regulation, imposes rules on communities in the Information Society. System design choices like network architecture and configurations create regulatory norms he termed "Lex Informatica"-referencing the merchant-driven medieval "Lex Mercatoria" that emerged independent of sovereign control. Today we face different challenges requiring us to revisit Reidenberg's insights and examine the consequences of that earlier era. While Lex Informatica provided a framework for analyzing the internet's birth, we now confront the aftereffects of decades of minimal or absent regulation. Critical questions emerge: When technological social norms develop outside clear legal restraints, who benefits and who suffers? This new era demands infrastructural reform focused on the interplay between public and private regulation and self-regulation, weighing both costs and benefits. Rather than showcasing the promise of yesterday's internet age, today's events reveal the pitfalls of information libertarianism and underscore the urgent need for new approaches to information regulation. This Issue presents articles from two symposiums-one on Lex Informatica and another on race and technology law. Their conversation is now essential. Together, these papers demonstrate what I call the "Lex Reformatica" of today's digital age. This collection shows why scholars, lawyers, and legislators must return to Reidenberg's foundational work and update its trajectory toward a reform-focused approach designed for our current era.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAM-SD: Retrieval-Augmented Multi-agent framework for Sarcasm Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17002</link><description>arXiv:2601.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sarcasm detection remains a significant challenge due to its reliance on nuanced contextual understanding, world knowledge, and multi-faceted linguistic cues that vary substantially across different sarcastic expressions. Existing approaches, from fine-tuned transformers to large language models, apply a uniform reasoning strategy to all inputs, struggling to address the diverse analytical demands of sarcasm. These demands range from modeling contextual expectation violations to requiring external knowledge grounding or recognizing specific rhetorical patterns. To address this limitation, we introduce RAM-SD, a Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent framework for Sarcasm Detection. The framework operates through four stages: (1) contextual retrieval grounds the query in both sarcastic and non-sarcastic exemplars; (2) a meta-planner classifies the sarcasm type and selects an optimal reasoning plan from a predefined set; (3) an ensemble of specialized agents performs complementary, multi-view analysis; and (4) an integrator synthesizes these analyses into a final, interpretable judgment with a natural language explanation. Evaluated on four standard benchmarks, RAM-SD achieves a state-of-the-art Macro-F1 of 77.74%, outperforming the strong GPT-4o+CoC baseline by 7.01 points. Our framework not only sets a new performance benchmark but also provides transparent and interpretable reasoning traces, illuminating the cognitive processes behind sarcasm comprehension.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17002v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Simulations: What 20,000 Real Conversations Reveal About Mental Health AI Safety</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17003</link><description>arXiv:2601.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for mental health support, yet existing safety evaluations rely primarily on small, simulation-based test sets that have an unknown relationship to the linguistic distribution of real usage. In this study, we present replications of four published safety test sets targeting suicide risk assessment, harmful content generation, refusal robustness, and adversarial jailbreaks for a leading frontier generic AI model alongside an AI purpose built for mental health support. We then propose and conduct an ecological audit on over 20,000 real-world user conversations with the purpose-built AI designed with layered suicide and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) safeguards to compare test set performance to real world performance. While the purpose-built AI was significantly less likely than general-purpose LLMs to produce enabling or harmful content across suicide/NSSI (.4-11.27% vs 29.0-54.4%), eating disorder (8.4% vs 54.0%), and substance use (9.9% vs 45.0%) benchmark prompts, test set failure rates for suicide/NSSI were far higher than in real-world deployment. Clinician review of flagged conversations from the ecological audit identified zero cases of suicide risk that failed to receive crisis resources. Across all 20,000 conversations, three mentions of NSSI risk (.015%) did not trigger a crisis intervention; among sessions flagged by the LLM judge, this corresponds to an end-to-end system false negative rate of .38%, providing a lower bound on real-world safety failures. These findings support a shift toward continuous, deployment-relevant safety assurance for AI mental-health systems rather than limited set benchmark certification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17003v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MathMixup: Boosting LLM Mathematical Reasoning with Difficulty-Controllable Data Synthesis and Curriculum Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17006</link><description>arXiv:2601.17006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematical reasoning tasks, the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on high-quality training data with clearly defined and well-graded difficulty levels. However, existing data synthesis methods often suffer from limited diversity and lack precise control over problem difficulty, making them insufficient for supporting efficient training paradigms such as curriculum learning. To address these challenges, we propose MathMixup, a novel data synthesis paradigm that systematically generates high-quality, difficulty-controllable mathematical reasoning problems through hybrid and decomposed strategies. Automated self-checking and manual screening are incorporated to ensure semantic clarity and a well-structured difficulty gradient in the synthesized data. Building on this, we construct the MathMixupQA dataset and design a curriculum learning strategy that leverages these graded problems, supporting flexible integration with other datasets. Experimental results show that MathMixup and its curriculum learning strategy significantly enhance the mathematical reasoning performance of LLMs. Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average score of 52.6\% across seven mathematical benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. These results fully validate the effectiveness and broad applicability of MathMixup in improving the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs and advancing data-centric curriculum learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17006v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analysis of voice recordings features for Classification of Parkinson's Disease</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17007</link><description>arXiv:2601.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease. Early diagnosis is essential to mitigate the progressive deterioration of patients' quality of life. The most characteristic motor symptoms are very mild in the early stages, making diagnosis difficult. Recent studies have shown that the use of patient voice recordings can aid in early diagnosis. Although the analysis of such recordings is costly from a clinical point of view, advances in machine learning techniques are making the processing of this type of data increasingly accurate and efficient. Vocal recordings contain many features, but it is not known whether all of them are relevant for diagnosing the disease.
  This paper proposes the use of different types of machine learning models combined with feature selection methods to detect the disease. The selection techniques allow to reduce the number of features used by the classifiers by determining which ones provide the most information about the problem. The results show that machine learning methods, in particular neural networks, are suitable for PD classification and that the number of features can be significantly reduced without affecting the performance of the models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Robust Financial Trading with Adversarial Synthetic Market Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17008</link><description>arXiv:2601.17008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading relies on machine learning models to make trading decisions. Despite strong in-sample performance, these models often degrade when confronted with evolving real-world market regimes, which can shift dramatically due to macroeconomic changes-e.g., monetary policy updates or unanticipated fluctuations in participant behavior. We identify two challenges that perpetuate this mismatch: (1) insufficient robustness in existing policy against uncertainties in high-level market fluctuations, and (2) the absence of a realistic and diverse simulation environment for training, leading to policy overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian Robust Framework that systematically integrates a macro-conditioned generative model with robust policy learning. On the data side, to generate realistic and diverse data, we propose a macro-conditioned GAN-based generator that leverages macroeconomic indicators as primary control variables, synthesizing data with faithful temporal, cross-instrument, and macro correlations. On the policy side, to learn robust policy against market fluctuations, we cast the trading process as a two-player zero-sum Bayesian Markov game, wherein an adversarial agent simulates shifting regimes by perturbing macroeconomic indicators in the macro-conditioned generator, while the trading agent-guided by a quantile belief network-maintains and updates its belief over hidden market states. The trading agent seeks a Robust Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium via Bayesian neural fictitious self-play, stabilizing learning under adversarial market perturbations. Extensive experiments on 9 financial instruments demonstrate that our framework outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines. In extreme events like the COVID, our method shows improved profitability and risk management, offering a reliable solution for trading under uncertain and shifting market dynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17008v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimizing the Landscape of LLM Embeddings with Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis for Generative Psychometrics: A Monte Carlo Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17010</link><description>arXiv:2601.17010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) embeddings are increasingly used to estimate dimensional structure in psychological item pools prior to data collection, yet current applications treat embeddings as static, cross-sectional representations. This approach implicitly assumes uniform contribution across all embedding coordinates and overlooks the possibility that optimal structural information may be concentrated in specific regions of the embedding space. This study reframes embeddings as searchable landscapes and adapts Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis (DynEGA) to systematically traverse embedding coordinates, treating the dimension index as a pseudo-temporal ordering analogous to intensive longitudinal trajectories. A large-scale Monte Carlo simulation embedded items representing five dimensions of grandiose narcissism using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model, generating network estimations across systematically varied item pool sizes (3-40 items per dimension) and embedding depths (3-1,298 dimensions). Results reveal that Total Entropy Fit Index (TEFI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) leads to competing optimization trajectories across the embedding landscape. TEFI achieves minima at deep embedding ranges (900--1,200 dimensions) where entropy-based organization is maximal but structural accuracy degrades, whereas NMI peaks at shallow depths where dimensional recovery is strongest but entropy-based fit remains suboptimal. Single-metric optimization produces structurally incoherent solutions, whereas a weighted composite criterion identifies embedding dimensions depth regions that jointly balance accuracy and organization. Optimal embedding depth scales systematically with item pool size. These findings establish embedding landscapes as non-uniform semantic spaces requiring principled optimization rather than default full-vector usage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Digital Divide in Geriatric Care: Why Usability, Not Access, is the Real Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17012</link><description>arXiv:2601.17012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in the world's aging population to 16% by the year 2050 spurs the need for the application of digital health solutions to enhance older individuals' independence, accessibility, and well-being. While digital health technologies such as telemedicine, wearables, and mobile health applications can transform geriatric care, their adoption among older individuals is not evenly distributed. This study redefines the "digital divide" among older health care as a usability divide, contends that user experience (UX) poor design is the primary adoption barrier, rather than access. Drawing on interdisciplinary studies and design paradigms, the research identifies the main challenges: visual, cognitive, and motor impairment; complicated interfaces; and lack of co-creation with older adults, and outlines how participatory, user-focused, and inclusive notions of design can transcend them. Findings reveal that older persons easily embrace those technologies that are intuitive, accessible, and socially embedded as they promote autonomy, confidence, and equity in health. The study identifies the effects of the design attributes of high-contrast screens, lower interaction flow, multimodal feedback, and caregiver integration as having strong influences on usability outcomes. In addition, it critiques the current accessibility guidelines as being technically oriented rather than experiential and demands an ethical, empathetic understanding of design grounded in human-centered usability rather than technical accessibility in itself.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17012v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Private Accountability in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17013</link><description>arXiv:2601.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Article, I explore the impending conflict between the protection of civil rights and artificial intelligence (AI). While both areas of law have amassed rich and well-developed areas of scholarly work and doctrinal support, a growing body of scholars are interrogating the intersection between them. This Article argues that the issues surrounding algorithmic accountability demonstrate a deeper, more structural tension within a new generation of disputes regarding law and technology. As I argue, the true promise of AI does not lie in the information we reveal to one another, but rather in the questions it raises about the interaction of technology, property, and civil rights. For this reason, I argue that we are looking in the wrong place if we look only to the state to address issues of algorithmic accountability. Instead, we must turn to other ways to ensure more transparency and accountability that stem from private industry, rather than public regulation. The issue of algorithmic bias represents a crucial new world of civil rights concerns, one that is distinct in nature from the ones that preceded it. Since we are in a world where the activities of private corporations, rather than the state, are raising concerns about privacy, due process, and discrimination, we must focus on the role of private corporations in addressing the issue. Towards this end, I discuss a variety of tools to help eliminate the opacity of AI, including codes of conduct, impact statements, and whistleblower protection, which I argue carries the potential to encourage greater endogeneity in civil rights enforcement. Ultimately, by examining the relationship between private industry and civil rights, we can perhaps develop a new generation of forms of accountability in the process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17013v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Measuring Political Stance and Consistency in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17016</link><description>arXiv:2601.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the incredible advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), many people have started using them to satisfy their information needs. However, utilizing LLMs might be problematic for political issues where disagreement is common and model outputs may reflect training-data biases or deliberate alignment choices. To better characterize such behavior, we assess the stances of nine LLMs on 24 politically sensitive issues using five prompting techniques. We find that models often adopt opposing stances on several issues; some positions are malleable under prompting, while others remain stable. Among the models examined, Grok-3-mini is the most persistent, whereas Mistral-7B is the least. For issues involving countries with different languages, models tend to support the side whose language is used in the prompt. Notably, no prompting technique alters model stances on the Qatar blockade or the oppression of Palestinians. We hope these findings raise user awareness when seeking political guidance from LLMs and encourage developers to address these concerns.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17016v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Organizing Railway Traffic Management</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17017</link><description>arXiv:2601.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving traffic management in case of perturbation is one of the main challenges in today's railway research. The great majority of the existing literature proposes approaches to make centralized decisions to minimize delay propagation. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to the same aim: we design and implement a modular process to allow trains to self-organize. This process consists in having trains identifying their neighbors, formulating traffic management hypotheses, checking their compatibility and selecting the best ones through a consensus mechanism. Finally, these hypotheses are merged into a directly applicable traffic plan. In a thorough experimental analysis on a portion of the Italian network, we compare the results of self-organization with those of a state-of-the-art centralized approach. In particular, we make this comparison mimicking a realistic deployment thanks to a closed-loop framework including a microscopic railway simulator. The results indicate that self-organization achieves better results than the centralized algorithm, specifically thanks to the definition and exploitation of the instance decomposition allowed by the proposed approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17017v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating the Evolution of Critical Thinking, Creativity, Communication and Collaboration in Higher Education Courses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17018</link><description>arXiv:2601.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Creativity, Communication, Critical Thinking, and Collaboration (the 4Cs) is a central objective of contemporary competency-based education. However, empirical evidence on how these competencies evolve across learning modules and instructional phases remains limited. This study evaluates the evolution of the 4Cs from pre-pilot to pilot implementation phases across three educational contexts, using the project's 4Cs theoretical framework as an analytical lens. The analysis of three pilot cases (IASIS, EASD, and UPATRAS) compares the 4Cs scores to identify patterns of growth, stagnation, or decline over time. Results indicate that communication and critical thinking showed the most consistent and substantial improvements, particularly in pilots with lower pre-pilot baselines, suggesting that structured pilot interventions effectively support cognitive and expressive competencies. In contrast, creativity exhibited context-dependent outcomes, while collaboration emerged as the most fragile competency, often stagnating or declining during scale-up. Interpreted through the theoretical framework, these findings suggest that competency evolution is strongly shaped by instructional design, assessment alignment, and learning activity structures rather than learner ability alone. The study contributes empirical validation to the 4Cs framework and highlights the need for differentiated, competency-sensitive design and evaluation strategies when scaling educational modules.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context Lake: A System Class Defined by Decision Coherence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17019</link><description>arXiv:2601.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly the primary consumers of data, operating continuously to make concurrent, irreversible decisions. Traditional data systems designed for human analysis cycles become correctness bottlenecks under this operating regime. When multiple agents operate over shared resources, their actions interact before reconciliation is possible. Correctness guarantees that apply after the decision window therefore fail to prevent conflicts. We introduce the Decision Coherence Law: for agents that take irreversible actions whose effects interact, correctness requires that interacting decisions be evaluated against a coherent representation of reality at the moment they are made. We show that no existing system class satisfies this requirement and prove through the Composition Impossibility Theorem that independently advancing systems cannot be composed to provide Decision Coherence while preserving their native system classes. From this impossibility result, we derive Context Lake as a necessary system class with three requirements: (1) semantic operations as native capabilities, (2) transactional consistency over all decision-relevant state, and (3) operational envelopes bounding staleness and degradation under load. We formalize the architectural invariants, enforcement boundaries, and admissibility conditions required for correctness in collective agent systems. This position paper establishes the theoretical foundation for Context Lakes, identifies why existing architectures fail, and specifies what systems must guarantee for AI agents to operate constructively at scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Do We Engage with Other Disciplines?

Abstract: With the rising popularity of interdisciplinary work and increasing institutional incentives in this direction, there is a growing need to understand how resulting publications incorporate ideas from multiple disciplines. Existing computational approaches, such as affiliation diversity, keywords, and citation patterns, do not account for how individual citations are used to advance the citing work. Although, in line with addressing this gap, prior studies have proposed taxonomies to classify citation purpose, these frameworks are not well-suited to interdisciplinary research and do not provide quantitative measures of citation engagement quality. To address these limitations, we propose a framework for the evaluation of citation engagement in interdisciplinary Natural Language Processing (NLP) publications. Our approach introduces a citation purpose taxonomy tailored to interdisciplinary work, supported by an annotation study. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through a thorough analysis of publications at the intersection of NLP and Computational Social Science.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17020v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-based System for Transforming text and sound to Educational Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17022</link><description>arXiv:2601.17022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological developments have produced methods that can generate educational videos from input text or sound. Recently, the use of deep learning techniques for image and video generation has been widely explored, particularly in education. However, generating video content from conditional inputs such as text or speech remains a challenging area. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to the educational structure, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which develop frame-for-frame frameworks and are able to create full educational videos. The proposed system is structured into three main phases In the first phase, the input (either text or speech) is transcribed using speech recognition. In the second phase, key terms are extracted and relevant images are generated using advanced models such as CLIP and diffusion models to enhance visual quality and semantic alignment. In the final phase, the generated images are synthesized into a video format, integrated with either pre-recorded or synthesized sound, resulting in a fully interactive educational video. The proposed system is compared with other systems such as TGAN, MoCoGAN, and TGANS-C, achieving a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score of 28.75%, which indicates improved visual quality and better over existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17022v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Three Axes of Success: A Three-Dimensional Framework for Career Decision-Making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17023</link><description>arXiv:2601.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Career decision-making is a socio-technical problem: individuals exercise bounded agency while navigating labor market institutions, organizational incentive structures, and information asymmetries that shape feasible trajectories. Existing frameworks optimize along single dimensions - financial returns, work-life balance, or mission alignment - without explicit models for inter-dimensional tradeoffs or temporal dynamics. We propose The Three Axes of Success, a normative decision framework decomposing career trajectories into Wealth (career capital accumulation and economic optionality), Autonomy (control over task selection, temporal allocation, and strategic direction), and Meaning (counterfactual social impact scaled by problem importance and personal replaceability). We formalize coupling dynamics between axes: the adjacent possible mechanism by which skill frontiers enable mission discovery, creating nonlinear Wealth -&gt; Meaning transitions; autonomy prerequisites where insufficient career capital triggers control traps; and dual-career household constraints that yield Pareto-suboptimal Nash equilibria under independent optimization. We operationalize each axis through measurable proxies, analyze prototypical career archetypes - industrial R&amp;amp;D, academia, entrepreneurship - as points in (W, A, M)-space, and derive sequential versus simultaneous optimization strategies under uncertainty. The framework converts implicit career anxiety into explicit multi-objective optimization problems with satisficing thresholds, structuring the human-system interaction between individual deliberation and institutional constraints. This provides the first unified decision-theoretic treatment of career success, integrating insights from human capital theory, self-determination theory, and effective altruism into a coherent architecture for rational career design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17023v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ensuring Computer Science Learning in the AI Era: Open Generative AI Policies and Assignment-Driven Written Quizzes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17024</link><description>arXiv:2601.17024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has created a pressing challenge in computer science (CS) education: how to incorporate powerful AI tools into programming coursework without undermining student learning through cognitive offloading. This paper presents an assessment model that permits the use of generative AI for take-home programming assignments while enforcing individual mastery through immediate, assignment-driven written quizzes. To promote authentic learning, these in-class, closed-book assessments are weighted more heavily than the assignments themselves and are specifically designed to verify the student's comprehension of the algorithms, structure, and implementation details of their submitted code. Preliminary empirical data were collected from an upper-level computer science course to examine the relationship between self-reported GenAI usage and performance on AI-free quizzes, exams, and final course grades. Statistical analyses revealed no meaningful linear correlation between GenAI usage levels and assessment outcomes, with Pearson correlation coefficients consistently near zero. These preliminary results suggest that allowing GenAI for programming assignments does not diminish students' mastery of course concepts when learning is verified through targeted, assignment-driven quizzes. Although limited by a small sample size, this study provides preliminary evidence that the risks of cognitive offloading can be mitigated by allowing AI-assisted programming practice while verifying understanding through assignment-driven, AI-free quizzes. The findings support the responsible adoption of open GenAI policies in upper-level CS courses, when paired with rigorous, independent assessment mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17024v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] (Mis-)Informed Consent: Predatory Apps and the Exploitation of Populations with Limited Literacy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17025</link><description>arXiv:2601.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among populations with limited literacy in emerging digital markets, the adoption of mobile phones, combined with comprehension barriers and poor cybersecurity hygiene, has created hidden privacy risks. This paper examines how informed consent is often abused by predatory financial applications, leading to financial scams that disproportionately affect users with low literacy. We focus on predatory loan, gambling, and trading apps, analyzing a dataset of 50 Google Play Store apps to measure how many omit or obfuscate critical privacy disclosures. We also evaluate comprehension gaps among users with low literacy via a targeted user study and assess whether Large Language Model (LLM)-generated summaries, translations, and visual cues can improve consent clarity. Our findings show that 85% of study participants did not understand basic app permissions, underscoring the urgent need for stronger regulatory oversight and scalable LLM-driven privacy-literacy tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17025v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scientific Image Synthesis: Benchmarking, Methodologies, and Downstream Utility</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17027</link><description>arXiv:2601.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While synthetic data has proven effective for improving scientific reasoning in the text domain, multimodal reasoning remains constrained by the difficulty of synthesizing scientifically rigorous images. Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in a persistent visual-logic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct a systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, a logic-driven framework that follows an explicit "understand - plan - code" workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights a fundamental expressiveness-precision trade-off. Finally, we show that fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on rigorously verified synthetic scientific images yields consistent reasoning gains, with potential scaling trends analogous to the text domain, validating high-fidelity scientific synthesis as a viable path to unlocking massive multimodal reasoning capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17027v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PALMA: A Lightweight Tropical Algebra Library for ARM-Based Embedded Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17028</link><description>arXiv:2601.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical algebra, including max-plus, min-plus, and related idempotent semirings, provides a unifying framework in which many optimization problems that are nonlinear in classical algebra become linear. This property makes tropical methods particularly well suited for shortest paths, scheduling, throughput analysis, and discrete event systems. Despite their theoretical maturity and practical relevance, existing tropical algebra implementations primarily target desktop or server environments and remain largely inaccessible on resource-constrained embedded platforms, where such optimization problems are most acute. We present PALMA (Parallel Algebra Library for Max-plus Applications), a lightweight, dependency-free C library that brings tropical linear algebra to ARM-based embedded systems. PALMA implements a generic semiring abstraction with SIMD-accelerated kernels, enabling a single computational framework to support shortest paths, bottleneck paths, reachability, scheduling, and throughput analysis. The library supports five tropical semirings, dense and sparse (CSR) representations, tropical closure, and spectral analysis via maximum cycle mean computation. We evaluate PALMA on a Raspberry Pi 4 and demonstrate peak performance of 2,274 MOPS, speedups of up to 11.9 times over classical Bellman-Ford for single-source shortest paths, and sub-10 microsecond scheduling solves for real-time control workloads. Case studies in UAV control, IoT routing, and manufacturing systems show that tropical algebra enables efficient, predictable, and unified optimization directly on embedded hardware. PALMA is released as open-source software under the MIT license.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17028v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-Efficient Meningioma Segmentation via Implicit Spatiotemporal Mixing and Sim2Real Semantic Injection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17031</link><description>arXiv:2601.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of medical image segmentation is increasingly defined by the efficiency of data utilization rather than merely the volume of raw data. Accurate segmentation, particularly for complex pathologies like meningiomas, demands that models fully exploit the latent information within limited high-quality annotations. To maximize the value of existing datasets, we propose a novel dual-augmentation framework that synergistically integrates spatial manifold expansion and semantic object injection. Specifically, we leverage Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model continuous velocity fields. Unlike previous methods, we perform linear mixing on the integrated deformation fields, enabling the efficient generation of anatomically plausible variations by interpolating within the deformation space. This approach allows for the extensive exploration of structural diversity from a small set of anchors. Furthermore, we introduce a Sim2Real lesion injection module. This module constructs a high-fidelity simulation domain by transplanting lesion textures into healthy anatomical backgrounds, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic augmentation and real-world pathology. Comprehensive experiments on a hybrid dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the data efficiency and robustness of state-of-the-art models, including nnU-Net and U-Mamba, offering a potent strategy for high-performance medical image analysis with limited annotation budgets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17031v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diagnosis Support of Sickle Cell Anemia by Classifying Red Blood Cell Shape in Peripheral Blood Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17032</link><description>arXiv:2601.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red blood cell (RBC) deformation is the consequence of several diseases, including sickle cell anemia, which causes recurring episodes of pain and severe pronounced anemia. Monitoring patients with these diseases involves the observation of peripheral blood samples under a microscope, a time-consuming procedure. Moreover, a specialist is required to perform this technique, and owing to the subjective nature of the observation of isolated RBCs, the error rate is high. In this paper, we propose an automated method for differentially enumerating RBCs that uses peripheral blood smear image analysis. In this method, the objects of interest in the image are segmented using a Chan-Vese active contour model. An analysis is then performed to classify the RBCs, also called erythrocytes, as normal or elongated or having other deformations, using the basic shape analysis descriptors: circular shape factor (CSF) and elliptical shape factor (ESF). To analyze cells that become partially occluded in a cluster during sample preparation, an elliptical adjustment is performed to allow the analysis of erythrocytes with discoidal and elongated shapes. The images of patient blood samples used in the study were acquired by a clinical laboratory specialist in the Special Hematology Department of the ``Dr. Juan Bruno Zayas'' General Hospital in Santiago de Cuba. A comparison of the results obtained by the proposed method in our experiments with those obtained by some state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed method is superior for the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. This superiority is achieved for evidenced by the obtained F-measure value (0.97 for normal cells and 0.95 for elongated ones) and several overall multiclass performance measures. The results achieved by the proposed method are suitable for the purpose of clinical treatment and diagnostic support of sickle cell anemia.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17032v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-Generated or Human-Written?

Abstract: ArXiv recently prohibited the upload of unpublished review papers to its servers in the Computer Science domain, citing a high prevalence of LLM-generated content in these categories. However, this decision was not accompanied by quantitative evidence. In this work, we investigate this claim by measuring the proportion of LLM-generated content in review vs. non-review research papers in recent years. Using two high-quality detection methods, we find a substantial increase in LLM-generated content across both review and non-review papers, with a higher prevalence in review papers. However, when considering the number of LLM-generated papers published in each category, the estimates of non-review LLM-generated papers are almost six times higher. Furthermore, we find that this policy will affect papers in certain domains far more than others, with the CS subdiscipline Computers &amp; Society potentially facing cuts of 50%. Our analysis provides an evidence-based framework for evaluating such policy decisions, and we release our code to facilitate future investigations at: https://github.com/yanaiela/llm-review-arxiv.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17036v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AMVICC: A Novel Benchmark for Cross-Modal Failure Mode Profiling for VLMs and IGMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17037</link><description>arXiv:2601.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated visual reasoning limitations of both multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models (IGMs) by creating a novel benchmark to systematically compare failure modes across image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, enabling cross-modal evaluation of visual understanding. Despite rapid growth in machine learning, vision language models (VLMs) still fail to understand or generate basic visual concepts such as object orientation, quantity, or spatial relationships, which highlighted gaps in elementary visual reasoning. By adapting MMVP benchmark questions into explicit and implicit prompts, we create \textit{AMVICC}, a novel benchmark for profiling failure modes across various modalities. After testing 11 MLLMs and 3 IGMs in nine categories of visual reasoning, our results show that failure modes are often shared between models and modalities, but certain failures are model-specific and modality-specific, and this can potentially be attributed to various factors. IGMs consistently struggled to manipulate specific visual components in response to prompts, especially in explicit prompts, suggesting poor control over fine-grained visual attributes. Our findings apply most directly to the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art models on structured visual reasoning tasks. This work lays the foundation for future cross-modal alignment studies, offering a framework to probe whether generation and interpretation failures stem from shared limitations to guide future improvements in unified vision-language modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid Deep Feature Extraction and ML for Construction and Demolition Debris Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17038</link><description>arXiv:2601.17038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction industry produces significant volumes of debris, making effective sorting and classification critical for sustainable waste management and resource recovery. This study presents a hybrid vision-based pipeline that integrates deep feature extraction with classical machine learning (ML) classifiers for automated construction and demolition (C\&amp;amp;D) debris classification. A novel dataset comprising 1,800 balanced, high-quality images representing four material categories, Ceramic/Tile, Concrete, Trash/Waste, and Wood was collected from real construction sites in the UAE, capturing diverse real-world conditions. Deep features were extracted using a pre-trained Xception network, and multiple ML classifiers, including SVM, kNN, Bagged Trees, LDA, and Logistic Regression, were systematically evaluated. The results demonstrate that hybrid pipelines using Xception features with simple classifiers such as Linear SVM, kNN, and Bagged Trees achieve state-of-the-art performance, with up to 99.5\% accuracy and macro-F1 scores, surpassing more complex or end-to-end deep learning approaches. The analysis highlights the operational benefits of this approach for robust, field-deployable debris identification and provides pathways for future integration with robotics and onsite automation systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17038v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MANGO: A Global Single-Date Paired Dataset for Mangrove Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17039</link><description>arXiv:2601.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mangroves are critical for climate-change mitigation, requiring reliable monitoring for effective conservation. While deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for mangrove detection, its progress is hindered by the limitations of existing datasets. In particular, many resources provide only annual map products without curated single-date image-mask pairs, limited to specific regions rather than global coverage, or remain inaccessible to the public. To address these challenges, we introduce MANGO, a large-scale global dataset comprising 42,703 labeled image-mask pairs across 124 countries. To construct this dataset, we retrieve all available Sentinel-2 imagery within the year 2020 for mangrove regions and select the best single-date observations that align with the mangrove annual mask. This selection is performed using a target detection-driven approach that leverages pixel-wise coordinate references to ensure adaptive and representative image-mask pairings. We also provide a benchmark across diverse semantic segmentation architectures under a country-disjoint split, establishing a foundation for scalable and reliable global mangrove monitoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17039v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FP-THD: Full page transcription of historical documents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17040</link><description>arXiv:2601.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transcription of historical documents written in Latin in XV and XVI centuries has special challenges as it must maintain the characters and special symbols that have distinct meanings to ensure that historical texts retain their original style and significance. This work proposes a pipeline for the transcription of historical documents preserving these special features. We propose to extend an existing text line recognition method with a layout analysis model. We analyze historical text images using a layout analysis model to extract text lines, which are then processed by an OCR model to generate a fully digitized page. We showed that our pipeline facilitates the processing of the page and produces an efficient result. We evaluated our approach on multiple datasets and demonstrate that the masked autoencoder effectively processes different types of text, including handwritten, printed and multi-language.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17040v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Arabic Sign Language Recognition using Multimodal Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17041</link><description>arXiv:2601.17041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) is an essential communication method for individuals in the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community. However, existing recognition systems face significant challenges due to their reliance on single sensor approaches like Leap Motion or RGB cameras. These systems struggle with limitations such as inadequate tracking of complex hand orientations and imprecise recognition of 3D hand movements. This research paper aims to investigate the potential of a multimodal approach that combines Leap Motion and RGB camera data to explore the feasibility of recognition of ArSL. The system architecture includes two parallel subnetworks: a custom dense neural network for Leap Motion data, incorporating dropout and L2 regularization, and an image subnetwork based on a fine-tuned VGG16 model enhanced with data augmentation techniques. Feature representations from both modalities are concatenated in a fusion model and passed through fully connected layers, with final classification performed via SoftMax activation to analyze spatial and temporal features of hand gestures. The system was evaluated on a custom dataset comprising 18 ArSL words, of which 13 were correctly recognized, yielding an overall accuracy of 78%. These results offer preliminary insights into the viability of multimodal fusion for sign language recognition and highlight areas for further optimization and dataset expansion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpretable and Sparse Linear Attention with Decoupled Membership-Subspace Modeling via MCR2 Objective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17042</link><description>arXiv:2601.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR2)-driven white-box transformer, grounded in structured representation learning, unifies interpretability and efficiency, providing a reliable white-box solution for visual modeling. However, in existing designs, tight coupling between "membership matrix" and "subspace matrix U" in MCR2 causes redundant coding under incorrect token projection. To this end, we decouple the functional relationship between the "membership matrix" and "subspaces U" in the MCR2 objective and derive an interpretable sparse linear attention operator from unrolled gradient descent of the optimized objective. Specifically, we propose to directly learn the membership matrix from inputs and subsequently derive sparse subspaces from the fullspace S. Consequently, gradient unrolling of the optimized MCR2 objective yields an interpretable sparse linear attention operator: Decoupled Membership-Subspace Attention (DMSA). Experimental results on visual tasks show that simply replacing the attention module in Token Statistics Transformer (ToST) with DMSA (we refer to as DMST) not only achieves a faster coding reduction rate but also outperforms ToST by 1.08%-1.45% in top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Compared with vanilla Transformer architectures, DMST exhibits significantly higher computational efficiency and interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17042v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Atomic Depth Estimation From Noisy Electron Microscopy Data Via Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17046</link><description>arXiv:2601.17046v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Characterizing imaging noise is notoriously data-intensive and device-dependent, as modern sensors entangle physical signals with complex algorithmic artifacts. Current paradigms struggle to disentangle these factors without massive supervised datasets, often reducing noise to mere interference rather than an information resource. Here, we introduce "Noisomics", a framework shifting the focus from suppression to systematic noise decoding via the Contrastive Pre-trained (CoP) Foundation Model. By leveraging the manifold hypothesis and synthetic noise genome, CoP employs contrastive learning to disentangle semantic signals from stochastic perturbations. Crucially, CoP breaks traditional deep learning scaling laws, achieving superior performance with only 100 training samples, outperforming supervised baselines trained on 100,000 samples, thereby reducing data and computational dependency by three orders of magnitude. Extensive benchmarking across 12 diverse out-of-domain datasets confirms its robust zero-shot generalization, demonstrating a 63.8% reduction in estimation error and an 85.1% improvement in the coefficient of determination compared to the conventional training strategy. We demonstrate CoP's utility across scales: from deciphering non-linear hardware-noise interplay in consumer photography to optimizing photon-efficient protocols for deep-tissue microscopy. By decoding noise as a multi-parametric footprint, our work redefines stochastic degradation as a vital information resource, empowering precise imaging diagnostics without prior device calibration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SiMiC: Context-Aware Silicon Microstructure Characterization Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for Field-Emission Tip Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17048</link><description>arXiv:2601.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of silicon microstructures is essential for advancing microscale fabrication, quality control, and device performance. Traditional analysis using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) often requires labor-intensive, manual evaluation of feature geometry, limiting throughput and reproducibility. In this study, we propose SiMiC: Context-Aware Silicon Microstructure Characterization Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for Field-Emission Tip Analysis. By leveraging deep learning, our approach efficiently extracts morphological features-such as size, shape, and apex curvature-from SEM images, significantly reducing human intervention while improving measurement consistency. A specialized dataset of silicon-based field-emitter tips was developed, and a customized CNN architecture incorporating attention mechanisms was trained for multi-class microstructure classification and dimensional prediction. Comparative analysis with classical image processing techniques demonstrates that SiMiC achieves high accuracy while maintaining interpretability. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for data-driven microstructure analysis directly linked to field-emission performance, opening avenues for correlating emitter geometry with emission behavior and guiding the design of optimized cold-cathode and SEM electron sources.

Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the Recognize the Unseen: Unusual Behavior Recognition from Pose Data Challenge, hosted at ISAS 2025. The challenge aims to address the critical need for automated recognition of unusual behaviors in facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities using non-invasive pose estimation data. Participating teams were tasked with distinguishing between normal and unusual activities based on skeleton keypoints extracted from video recordings of simulated scenarios. The dataset reflects real-world imbalance and temporal irregularities in behavior, and the evaluation adopted a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) strategy to ensure subject-agnostic generalization. The challenge attracted broad participation from 40 teams applying diverse approaches ranging from classical machine learning to deep learning architectures. Submissions were assessed primarily using macro-averaged F1 scores to account for class imbalance. The results highlight the difficulty of modeling rare, abrupt actions in noisy, low-dimensional data, and emphasize the importance of capturing both temporal and contextual nuances in behavior modeling. Insights from this challenge may contribute to future developments in socially responsible AI applications for healthcare and behavior monitoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model for Intrinsic Privacy-Preserving Behavioral Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17050</link><description>arXiv:2601.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adverse social interactions, such as bullying, harassment, and other illicit activities, pose significant threats to individual well-being and public safety, leaving profound impacts on physical and mental health. However, these critical events frequently occur in privacy-sensitive environments like restrooms, and changing rooms, where conventional surveillance is prohibited or severely restricted by stringent privacy regulations and ethical concerns. Here, we propose the Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model (SP-VLM), a novel framework that reimagines secure environmental monitoring. It achieves intrinsic privacy-by-design by capturing human dynamics through inherently low-dimensional single-pixel modalities and inferring complex behavioral patterns via seamless vision-language integration. Building on this framework, we demonstrate that single-pixel sensing intrinsically suppresses identity recoverability, rendering state-of-the-art face recognition systems ineffective below a critical sampling rate. We further show that SP-VLM can nonetheless extract meaningful behavioral semantics, enabling robust anomaly detection, people counting, and activity understanding from severely degraded single-pixel observations. Combining these findings, we identify a practical sampling-rate regime in which behavioral intelligence emerges while personal identity remains strongly protected. Together, these results point to a human-rights-aligned pathway for safety monitoring that can support timely intervention without normalizing intrusive surveillance in privacy-sensitive spaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17050v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synthetic Data Guided Feature Selection for Robust Activity Recognition in Older Adults</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17053</link><description>arXiv:2601.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical activity during hip fracture rehabilitation is essential for mitigating long-term functional decline in geriatric patients. However, it is rarely quantified in clinical practice. Existing continuous monitoring systems with commercially available wearable activity trackers are typically developed in middle-aged adults and therefore perform unreliably in older adults with slower and more variable gait patterns. This study aimed to develop a robust human activity recognition (HAR) system to improve continuous physical activity recognition in the context of hip fracture rehabilitation. 24 healthy older adults aged over 80 years were included to perform activities of daily living (walking, standing, sitting, lying down, and postural transfers) under simulated free-living conditions for 75 minutes while wearing two accelerometers positioned on the lower back and anterior upper thigh. Model robustness was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The synthetic data demonstrated potential to improve generalization across participants. The resulting feature intervention model (FIM), aided by synthetic data guidance, achieved reliable activity recognition with mean F1-scores of 0.896 for walking, 0.927 for standing, 0.997 for sitting, 0.937 for lying down, and 0.816 for postural transfers. Compared with a control condition model without synthetic data, the FIM significantly improved the postural transfer detection, i.e., an activity class of high clinical relevance that is often overlooked in existing HAR literature. In conclusion, these preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of robust activity recognition in older adults. Further validation in hip fracture patient populations is required to assess the clinical utility of the proposed monitoring system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17053v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Failing on Bias Mitigation: Investigating Why Predictive Models Struggle with Government Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17054</link><description>arXiv:2601.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for bias and unfairness in AI-supporting government services raises ethical and legal concerns. Using crime rate prediction with the Bristol City Council data as a case study, we examine how these issues persist. Rather than auditing real-world deployed systems, our goal is to understand why widely adopted bias mitigation techniques often fail when applied to government data. Our findings reveal that bias mitigation approaches applied to government data are not always effective -- not because of flaws in model architecture or metric selection, but due to the inherent properties of the data itself. Through comparing a set of comprehensive models and fairness methods, our experiments consistently show that the mitigation efforts cannot overcome the embedded unfairness in the data -- further reinforcing that the origin of bias lies in the structure and history of government datasets. We then explore the reasons for the mitigation failures in predictive models on government data and highlight the potential sources of unfairness posed by data distribution shifts, the accumulation of historical bias, and delays in data release. We also discover the limitations of the blind spots in fairness analysis and bias mitigation methods when only targeting a single sensitive feature through a set of intersectional fairness experiments. Although this study is limited to one city, the findings are highly suggestive, which can contribute to an early warning that biases in government data may persist even with standard mitigation methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI, Metacognition, and the Verification Bottleneck: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study of Human Problem-Solving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17055</link><description>arXiv:2601.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This longitudinal pilot study tracked how generative AI reshapes problem-solving over six months across three waves in an academic setting. AI integration reached saturation by Wave 3, with daily use rising from 52.4% to 95.7% and ChatGPT adoption from 85.7% to 100%. A dominant hybrid workflow increased 2.7-fold, adopted by 39.1% of participants. The verification paradox emerged: participants relied most heavily on AI for difficult tasks (73.9%) yet showed declining verification confidence (68.1%) where performance was worst (47.8% accuracy on complex tasks). Objective performance declined systematically: 95.2% to 81.0% to 66.7% to 47.8% across problem difficulty, with belief-performance gaps widening to 34.6 percentage points. This indicates a fundamental shift where verification, not solution generation, became the bottleneck in human-AI problem-solving. The ACTIVE Framework synthesizes findings grounded in cognitive load theory: Awareness and task-AI alignment, Critical verification protocols, Transparent human-in-the-loop integration, Iterative skill development countering cognitive offloading, Verification confidence calibration, and Ethical evaluation. The authors provide implementation pathways for institutions and practitioners. Key limitations include sample homogeneity (academic cohort only, convenience sampling) limiting generalizability to corporate, clinical, or regulated professional contexts; self-report bias in confidence measures (32.2 percentage point divergence from objective performance); lack of control conditions; restriction to mathematical/analytical problems; and insufficient timeframe to assess long-term skill trajectories. Results generalize primarily to early-adopter, academically affiliated populations.

Abstract: Egocentric video action recognition under domain shifts remains challenging due to large intra-class spatio-temporal variability, long-tailed feature distributions, and strong correlations between actions and environments. Existing benchmarks for egocentric domain generalization often conflate covariate shifts with concept shifts, making it difficult to reliably evaluate a model's ability to generalize across input distributions. To address this limitation, we introduce Ego4OOD, a domain generalization benchmark derived from Ego4D that emphasizes measurable covariate diversity while reducing concept shift through semantically coherent, moment-level action categories. Ego4OOD spans eight geographically distinct domains and is accompanied by a clustering-based covariate shift metric that provides a quantitative proxy for domain difficulty. We further leverage a one-vs-all binary training objective that decomposes multi-class action recognition into independent binary classification tasks. This formulation is particularly well-suited for covariate shift by reducing interference between visually similar classes under feature distribution shift. Using this formulation, we show that a lightweight two-layer fully connected network achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art egocentric domain generalization methods on both Argo1M and Ego4OOD, despite using fewer parameters and no additional modalities. Our empirical analysis demonstrates a clear relationship between measured covariate shift and recognition performance, highlighting the importance of controlled benchmarks and quantitative domain characterization for studying out-of-distribution generalization in egocentric video.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17056v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Frequency-aware Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17057</link><description>arXiv:2601.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisited the role of data augmentation in contrastive learning for sequential recommendation, revealing its inherent bias against low-frequency items and sparse user behaviors. To address this limitation, we proposed FACL, a frequency-aware adaptive contrastive learning framework that introduces micro-level adaptive perturbation to protect the integrity of rare items, as well as macro-level reweighting to amplify the influence of sparse and rare-interaction sequences during training. Comprehensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrated that FACL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation and model augmentation-based methods, achieving up to 3.8% improvement in recommendation accuracy. Moreover, fine-grained analyses confirm that FACL significantly alleviates the performance drop on low-frequency items and users, highlighting its robust intent-preserving ability and its superior applicability to real-world, long-tail recommendation scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17057v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can LLMs Clean Up Your Mess? A Survey of Application-Ready Data Preparation with LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17058</link><description>arXiv:2601.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data preparation aims to denoise raw datasets, uncover cross-dataset relationships, and extract valuable insights from them, which is essential for a wide range of data-centric applications. Driven by (i) rising demands for application-ready data (e.g., for analytics, visualization, decision-making), (ii) increasingly powerful LLM techniques, and (iii) the emergence of infrastructures that facilitate flexible agent construction (e.g., using Databricks Unity Catalog), LLM-enhanced methods are rapidly becoming a transformative and potentially dominant paradigm for data preparation.
  By investigating hundreds of recent literature works, this paper presents a systematic review of this evolving landscape, focusing on the use of LLM techniques to prepare data for diverse downstream tasks. First, we characterize the fundamental paradigm shift, from rule-based, model-specific pipelines to prompt-driven, context-aware, and agentic preparation workflows. Next, we introduce a task-centric taxonomy that organizes the field into three major tasks: data cleaning (e.g., standardization, error processing, imputation), data integration (e.g., entity matching, schema matching), and data enrichment (e.g., data annotation, profiling). For each task, we survey representative techniques, and highlight their respective strengths (e.g., improved generalization, semantic understanding) and limitations (e.g., the prohibitive cost of scaling LLMs, persistent hallucinations even in advanced agents, the mismatch between advanced methods and weak evaluation). Moreover, we analyze commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics (the empirical part). Finally, we discuss open research challenges and outline a forward-looking roadmap that emphasizes scalable LLM-data systems, principled designs for reliable agentic workflows, and robust evaluation protocols.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17058v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Initial results of the Digital Consciousness Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17060</link><description>arXiv:2601.17060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificially intelligent systems have become remarkably sophisticated. They hold conversations, write essays, and seem to understand context in ways that surprise even their creators. This raises a crucial question: Are we creating systems that are conscious? The Digital Consciousness Model (DCM) is a first attempt to assess the evidence for consciousness in AI systems in a systematic, probabilistic way. It provides a shared framework for comparing different AIs and biological organisms, and for tracking how the evidence changes over time as AI develops. Instead of adopting a single theory of consciousness, it incorporates a range of leading theories and perspectives - acknowledging that experts disagree fundamentally about what consciousness is and what conditions are necessary for it. This report describes the structure and initial results of the Digital Consciousness Model. Overall, we find that the evidence is against 2024 LLMs being conscious, but the evidence against 2024 LLMs being conscious is not decisive. The evidence against LLM consciousness is much weaker than the evidence against consciousness in simpler AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17060v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Computer Vision Pipeline for Iterative Bullet Hole Tracking in Rifle Zeroing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17062</link><description>arXiv:2601.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjusting rifle sights, a process commonly called "zeroing," requires shooters to identify and differentiate bullet holes from multiple firing iterations. Traditionally, this process demands physical inspection, introducing delays due to range safety protocols and increasing the risk of human error. We present an end-to-end computer vision system for automated bullet hole detection and iteration-based tracking directly from images taken at the firing line. Our approach combines YOLOv8 for accurate small-object detection with Intersection over Union (IoU) analysis to differentiate bullet holes across sequential images. To address the scarcity of labeled sequential data, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that removes rather than adds objects to simulate realistic firing sequences. Additionally, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline that standardizes target orientation using ORB-based perspective correction, improving model accuracy. Our system achieves 97.0% mean average precision on bullet hole detection and 88.8% accuracy in assigning bullet holes to the correct firing iteration. While designed for rifle zeroing, this framework offers broader applicability in domains requiring the temporal differentiation of visually similar objects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17062v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlashMoE: Reducing SSD I/O Bottlenecks via ML-Based Cache Replacement for Mixture-of-Experts Inference on Edge Devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17063</link><description>arXiv:2601.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained attention for efficiently scaling large language models. Although these models are extremely large, their sparse activation enables inference to be performed by accessing only a fraction of the model at a time. This property opens the possibility of on-device inference of MoE, which was previously considered infeasible for such large models. Consequently, various systems have been proposed to leverage this sparsity and enable efficient MoE inference for edge devices. However, previous MoE inference systems like Fiddler[8] or DAOP[13] rely on DRAM-based offloading and are not suitable for memory constrained on-device environments. As recent MoE models grow to hundreds of gigabytes, RAM-offloading solutions become impractical. To address this, we propose FlashMoE, a system that offloads inactive experts to SSD, enabling efficient MoE inference under limited RAM. FlashMoE incorporates a lightweight ML-based caching strategy that adaptively combines recency and frequency signals to maximize expert reuse, significantly reducing storage I/O. In addition, we built a user-grade desktop platform to demonstrate the practicality of FlashMoE. On this real hardware setup, FlashMoE improves cache hit rate by up to 51% over well-known offloading policies such as LRU and LFU, and achieves up to 2.6x speedup compared to existing MoE inference systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17063v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Between Search and Platform: ChatGPT Under the DSA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17064</link><description>arXiv:2601.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the applicability of the Digital Services Act (DSA) to ChatGPT, arguing that it should be classified as a hybrid of the two types of hosting services: online search engines and platforms. This requires classifying search engines as hosting services, which we show is appropriate under the DSA, thereby resolving an ambiguity in the legal framework. ChatGPT performs core search functions and stores user-provided inputs and custom GPTs, meeting the definition of hosting service. We compare ChatGPT's systemic risks with those of existing Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs) and Platforms (VLOPs), showing that it raises similarly serious concerns regarding illegal content, fundamental rights, democratic integrity, and public health. Now that ChatGPT has reached the 45 million EU user threshold, it should be subject to the most onerous DSA obligations, requiring the assessment and mitigation of risk emanating from both its online search engine- and platform-like characteristics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ThinkTank-ME: A Multi-Expert Framework for Middle East Event Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17065</link><description>arXiv:2601.17065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event forecasting is inherently influenced by multifaceted considerations, including international relations, regional historical dynamics, and cultural contexts.

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated emergent physical coherence, positioning them as potential world models. However, a gap remains between contemporary "stateless" video architectures and classic state-centric world model theories. This work bridges this gap by proposing a novel taxonomy centered on two pillars: State Construction and Dynamics Modeling. We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation. Furthermore, we advocate for a transition in evaluation from visual fidelity to functional benchmarks, testing physical persistence and causal reasoning. We conclude by identifying two critical frontiers: enhancing persistence via data-driven memory and compressed fidelity, and advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration. By addressing these challenges, the field can evolve from generating visually plausible videos to building robust, general-purpose world simulators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Under Constrained Communications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17069</link><description>arXiv:2601.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) has been the dominant paradigm in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), but its reliance on global state information during training introduces scalability, robustness, and generalization bottlenecks. Moreover, in practical scenarios such as adding/dropping teammates or facing environment dynamics that differ from the training, CTDE methods can be brittle and costly to retrain, whereas distributed approaches allow agents to adapt using only local information and peer-to-peer communication. We present a distributed MARL framework that removes the need for centralized critics or global information. Firstly, we develop a novel Distributed Graph Attention Network (D-GAT) that performs global state inference through multi-hop communication, where agents integrate neighbor features via input-dependent attention weights in a fully distributed manner. Leveraging D-GAT, we develop the distributed graph-attention MAPPO (DG-MAPPO) -- a distributed MARL framework where agents optimize local policies and value functions using local observations, multi-hop communication, and shared/averaged rewards. Empirical evaluation on the StarCraftII Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent Mujoco demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines, achieving superior coordination across a wide range of cooperative tasks with both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams. Our distributed MARL framework provides a principled and scalable solution for robust collaboration, eliminating the need for centralized training or global observability. To the best of our knowledge, DG-MAPPO appears to be the first to fully eliminate reliance on privileged centralized information, enabling agents to learn and act solely through peer-to-peer communication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17069v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trademark Search, Artificial Intelligence and the Role of the Private Sector</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17072</link><description>arXiv:2601.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost every industry today confronts the potential role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in its future. While many studies examine AI in consumer marketing, less attention addresses AI's role in creating and selecting trademarks that are distinctive, recognizable, and meaningful to consumers. Traditional economic approaches to trademarks focus almost exclusively on consumer-based, demand-side considerations regarding search. However, these approaches are incomplete because they fail to account for substantial costs faced not just by consumers, but by trademark applicants as well. Given AI's rapidly increasing role in trademark search and similarity analysis, lawyers and scholars should understand its dramatic implications. This paper proposes that AI should interest anyone studying trademarks and their role in economic decision-making. We examine how machine learning techniques will transform the application and interpretation of foundational trademark doctrines, producing significant implications for the trademark ecosystem. We run empirical experiments regarding trademark search to assess the efficacy of various trademark search engines, many of which employ machine learning methods. Through comparative analysis, we evaluate how these AI-powered tools function in practice. In an age where artificial intelligence increasingly governs trademark selection, the classic division between consumers and trademark owners deserves an updated, supply-side framework. This insight has transformative potential for encouraging both innovation and efficiency in trademark law and practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17072v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Attention-Based Variational Framework for Joint and Individual Components Learning with Applications in Brain Network Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17073</link><description>arXiv:2601.17073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain organization is increasingly characterized through multiple imaging modalities, most notably structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC). Integrating these inherently distinct yet complementary data sources is essential for uncovering the cross-modal patterns that drive behavioral phenotypes. However, effective integration is hindered by the high dimensionality and non-linearity of connectome data, complex non-linear SC-FC coupling, and the challenge of disentangling shared information from modality-specific variations. To address these issues, we propose the Cross-Modal Joint-Individual Variational Network (CM-JIVNet), a unified probabilistic framework designed to learn factorized latent representations from paired SC-FC datasets. Our model utilizes a multi-head attention fusion module to capture non-linear cross-modal dependencies while isolating independent, modality-specific signals. Validated on Human Connectome Project Young Adult (HCP-YA) data, CM-JIVNet demonstrates superior performance in cross-modal reconstruction and behavioral trait prediction. By effectively disentangling joint and individual feature spaces, CM-JIVNet provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for large-scale multimodal brain analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17073v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PhysE-Inv: A Physics-Encoded Inverse Modeling approach for Arctic Snow Depth Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17074</link><description>arXiv:2601.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate estimation of Arctic snow depth ($h_s$) remains a critical time-varying inverse problem due to the extreme scarcity and noise inherent in associated sea ice parameters. Existing process-based and data-driven models are either highly sensitive to sparse data or lack the physical interpretability required for climate-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce PhysE-Inv, a novel framework that integrates a sophisticated sequential architecture, an LSTM Encoder-Decoder with Multi-head Attention and physics-guided contrastive learning, with physics-guided inference.Our core innovation lies in a surjective, physics-constrained inversion methodology. This methodology first leverages the hydrostatic balance forward model as a target-formulation proxy, enabling effective learning in the absence of direct $h_s$ ground truth; second, it uses reconstruction physics regularization over a latent space to dynamically discover hidden physical parameters from noisy, incomplete time-series input. Evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines, PhysE-Inv significantly improves prediction performance, reducing error by 20\% while demonstrating superior physical consistency and resilience to data sparsity compared to empirical methods. This approach pioneers a path for noise-tolerant, interpretable inverse modeling, with wide applicability in geospatial and cryospheric domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17074v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] E2PL: Effective and Efficient Prompt Learning for Incomplete Multi-view Multi-Label Class Incremental Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17076</link><description>arXiv:2601.17076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view multi-label classification (MvMLC) is indispensable for modern web applications aggregating information from diverse sources. However, real-world web-scale settings are rife with missing views and continuously emerging classes, which pose significant obstacles to robust learning. Prevailing methods are ill-equipped for this reality, as they either lack adaptability to new classes or incur exponential parameter growth when handling all possible missing-view patterns, severely limiting their scalability in web environments. To systematically address this gap, we formally introduce a novel task, termed \emph{incomplete multi-view multi-label class incremental learning} (IMvMLCIL), which requires models to simultaneously address heterogeneous missing views and dynamic class expansion. To tackle this task, we propose \textsf{E2PL}, an Effective and Efficient Prompt Learning framework for IMvMLCIL. \textsf{E2PL} unifies two novel prompt designs: \emph{task-tailored prompts} for class-incremental adaptation and \emph{missing-aware prompts} for the flexible integration of arbitrary view-missing scenarios. To fundamentally address the exponential parameter explosion inherent in missing-aware prompts, we devise an \emph{efficient prototype tensorization} module, which leverages atomic tensor decomposition to elegantly reduce the prompt parameter complexity from exponential to linear w.r.t. the number of views. We further incorporate a \emph{dynamic contrastive learning} strategy explicitly model the complex dependencies among diverse missing-view patterns, thus enhancing the model's robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that \textsf{E2PL} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. The codes and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/code-for-E2PL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17076v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Characterization of Geodetic Graphs in Terms of their Embedded Even Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17077</link><description>arXiv:2601.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of finding the general classification of geodetic graphs is still open. We believe that one of the obstacles to attain this goal is that geodetic graphs lack a structural description. In other words, their fundamental properties have not yet been established in terms of the description of the complete graphs, paths and cycles contained within them. The absence of this information makes their generation and enumeration (as inherent parts of their general classification) a difficult task. This paper examines the structural qualities of geodetic graphs using their so-called embedded even graphs. To this effect, the necessary and sufficient conditions for eliminating the nongeodecity of each pair of C-opposite vertices in an even cycle C have been formulated, while the bigeodecity of the embedded even graphs of a geodetic graph has been established. In a sense, this allows us to arrive at the conclusion that the basic building blocks of geodetic graphs are precisely this class of bigeodetic ones.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17077v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do VLMs Have a Moral Backbone?

Abstract: Despite substantial efforts toward improving the moral alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it remains unclear whether their ethical judgments are stable in realistic settings. This work studies moral robustness in VLMs, defined as the ability to preserve moral judgments under textual and visual perturbations that do not alter the underlying moral context. We systematically probe VLMs with a diverse set of model-agnostic multimodal perturbations and find that their moral stances are highly fragile, frequently flipping under simple manipulations. Our analysis reveals systematic vulnerabilities across perturbation types, moral domains, and model scales, including a sycophancy trade-off where stronger instruction-following models are more susceptible to persuasion. We further show that lightweight inference-time interventions can partially restore moral stability. These results demonstrate that moral alignment alone is insufficient and that moral robustness is a necessary criterion for the responsible deployment of VLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17082v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SonoEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Pronunciation Correction in LLM-Based TTS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17086</link><description>arXiv:2601.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems systematically mispronounce low-resource proper nouns, particularly non-English names, brands, and geographic locations, due to their underrepresentation in predominantly English training corpora. Existing solutions typically rely on expensive multilingual data collection, supervised finetuning, or manual phonetic annotation, which limits the deployment of TTS systems in linguistically diverse settings. We introduce SonoEdit, a model editing technique that surgically corrects pronunciation errors in pre-trained TTS models without retraining. Instead of costly finetuning or explicit phoneme injection, we propose a parsimonious alternative based on Null-Space Pronunciation Editing, which performs a single-shot parameter update to modify the pronunciation of specific words while provably preserving all other model behavior. We first adapt Acoustic Causal Tracing to identify the Transformer layers responsible for text-to-pronunciation mapping. We then apply Null-Space Constrained Editing to compute a closed-form weight update that corrects the target pronunciation while remaining mathematically orthogonal to the subspace governing general speech generation. This constrained update steers the model's acoustic output toward a desired pronunciation exemplar while guaranteeing zero first-order change on a preserved speech corpus.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17086v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lost in Simulation: LLM-Simulated Users are Unreliable Proxies for Human Users in Agentic Evaluations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17087</link><description>arXiv:2601.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic benchmarks increasingly rely on LLM-simulated users to scalably evaluate agent performance, yet the robustness, validity, and fairness of this approach remain unexamined. Through a user study with participants across the United States, India, Kenya, and Nigeria, we investigate whether LLM-simulated users serve as reliable proxies for real human users in evaluating agents on {\tau}-Bench retail tasks. We find that user simulation lacks robustness, with agent success rates varying up to 9 percentage points across different user LLMs. Furthermore, evaluations using simulated users exhibit systematic miscalibration, underestimating agent performance on challenging tasks and overestimating it on moderately difficult ones. African American Vernacular English (AAVE) speakers experience consistently worse success rates and calibration errors than Standard American English (SAE) speakers, with disparities compounding significantly with age. We also find simulated users to be a differentially effective proxy for different populations, performing worst for AAVE and Indian English speakers. Additionally, simulated users introduce conversational artifacts and surface different failure patterns than human users. These findings demonstrate that current evaluation practices risk misrepresenting agent capabilities across diverse user populations and may obscure real-world deployment challenges.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17087v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GlassesGB: Controllable 2D GAN-Based Eyewear Personalization for 3D Gaussian Blendshapes Head Avatars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17088</link><description>arXiv:2601.17088v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in visual question answering tasks. However, directly applying existing fine-tuning methods to remote sensing (RS) images often leads to issues such as overfitting on background noise or neglecting target details. This is primarily due to the large-scale variations, sparse target distributions, and complex regional semantic features inherent in RS images. These challenges limit the effectiveness of MLLMs in RS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy called Guided Region-Aware Sparse Prompting (GRASP). GRASP introduces spatially structured soft prompts associated with spatial blocks extracted from a frozen visual token grid. Through a question-guided sparse fusion mechanism, GRASP dynamically aggregates task-specific context into a compact global prompt, enabling the model to focus on relevant regions while filtering out background noise. Extensive experiments on multiple RSVQA benchmarks show that GRASP achieves competitive performance compared to existing fine-tuning and prompt-based methods while maintaining high parameter efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17089v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SFO: Learning PDE Operators via Spectral Filtering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17090</link><description>arXiv:2601.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern complex systems, yet neural operators often struggle to efficiently capture the long-range, nonlocal interactions inherent in their solution maps. We introduce Spectral Filtering Operator (SFO), a neural operator that parameterizes integral kernels using the Universal Spectral Basis (USB), a fixed, global orthonormal basis derived from the eigenmodes of the Hilbert matrix in spectral filtering theory. Motivated by our theoretical finding that the discrete Green's functions of shift-invariant PDE discretizations exhibit spatial Linear Dynamical System (LDS) structure, we prove that these kernels admit compact approximations in the USB. By learning only the spectral coefficients of rapidly decaying eigenvalues, SFO achieves a highly efficient representation.

It applies convolution with randomly generated kernels on a time series, producing features that can be used to train a linear classifier or regressor like Ridge. At the time of publication, ROCKET was on par with the best state-of-the-art algorithms for TSC in terms of accuracy while being significantly less computationally expensive, making ROCKET a compelling algorithm for TSC. This also led to several subsequent versions, further improving accuracy and computational efficiency. The currently available ROCKET implementations are mostly bound to execution on CPU. However, convolution is a task that can be highly parallelized and is therefore suited to be executed on GPU, which speeds up the computation significantly. A key difficulty arises from the inhomogeneous kernels ROCKET uses, making standard methods for applying convolution on GPU inefficient. In this work, we propose an algorithm that is able to efficiently perform ROCKET on GPU and achieves up to 11 times higher computational efficiency per watt than ROCKET on CPU. The code for CUROCKET is available in this repository https://github.com/oleeven/CUROCKET on github.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Triangle of Similarity: A Multi-Faceted Framework for Comparing Neural Network Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17093</link><description>arXiv:2601.17093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing neural network representations is essential for understanding and validating models in scientific applications. Existing methods, however, often provide a limited view. We propose the Triangle of Similarity, a framework that combines three complementary perspectives: static representational similarity (CKA/Procrustes), functional similarity (Linear Mode Connectivity or Predictive Similarity), and sparsity similarity (robustness under pruning). Analyzing a range of CNNs, Vision Transformers, and Vision-Language Models using both in-distribution (ImageNetV2) and out-of-distribution (CIFAR-10) testbeds, our initial findings suggest that: (1) architectural family is a primary determinant of representational similarity, forming distinct clusters; (2) CKA self-similarity and task accuracy are strongly correlated during pruning, though accuracy often degrades more sharply; and (3) for some model pairs, pruning appears to regularize representations, exposing a shared computational core. This framework offers a more holistic approach for assessing whether models have converged on similar internal mechanisms, providing a useful tool for model selection and analysis in scientific research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17093v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Boltzmann-GPT: Bridging Energy-Based World Models and Language Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17094</link><description>arXiv:2601.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent text, yet whether they truly understand the world or merely produce plausible language about it remains contested. We propose an architectural principle, the mouth is not the brain, that explicitly separates world models from language models. Our architecture comprises three components: a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) that captures domain structure as an energy-based world model, an adapter that projects latent belief states into embedding space, and a frozen GPT-2 that provides linguistic competence without domain knowledge. We instantiate this framework in the consumer review domain using Amazon smartphone reviews. Experiments demonstrate that (1) conditioning through the world model yields significantly higher sentiment correlation, lower perplexity, and greater semantic similarity compared to prompt-based generation alone; (2) the DBM's energy function distinguishes coherent from incoherent market configurations, assigning higher energy to implausible brand-price combinations; and (3) interventions on specific attributes propagate causally to generated text with intervened outputs exhibiting distributions statistically consistent with naturally occurring samples sharing the target configuration. These findings suggest that even small-scale language models can achieve consistent, controllable generation when connected to an appropriate world model, providing empirical support for separating linguistic competence from world understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17094v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LoD Sketch Extraction from Architectural Models Using Generative AI: Dataset Construction for Multi-Level Architectural Design Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17095</link><description>arXiv:2601.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For architectural design, representation across multiple Levels of Details (LoD) is essential for achieving a smooth transition from conceptual massing to detailed modeling. However, traditional LoD modeling processes rely on manual operations that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to geometric inconsistencies. While the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new possibilities for generating multi-level architectural models from sketch inputs, its application remains limited by the lack of high-quality paired LoD training data. To address this issue, we propose an automatic LoD sketch extraction framework using generative AI models, which progressively simplifies high-detail architectural models to automatically generate geometrically consistent and hierarchically coherent multi-LoD representations. The proposed framework integrates computer vision techniques with generative AI methods to establish a progressive extraction pipeline that transitions from detailed representations to volumetric abstractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method maintains strong geometric consistency across LoD levels, achieving SSIM values of 0.7319 and 0.7532 for the transitions from LoD3 to LoD2 and from LoD2 to LoD1, respectively, with corresponding normalized Hausdorff distances of 25.1% and 61.0% of the image diagonal, reflecting controlled geometric deviation during abstraction. These results verify that the proposed framework effectively preserves global structure while achieving progressive semantic simplification across different LoD levels, providing reliable data and technical support for AI-driven multi-level architectural generation and hierarchical modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17095v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Instrumental and Substitutive Paradigms: Introducing Machine Culture as an Emergent Phenomenon in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17096</link><description>arXiv:2601.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent scholarship typically characterizes Large Language Models (LLMs) through either an \textit{Instrumental Paradigm} (viewing models as reflections of their developers' culture) or a \textit{Substitutive Paradigm} (viewing models as bilingual proxies that switch cultural frames based on language). This study challenges these anthropomorphic frameworks by proposing \textbf{Machine Culture} as an emergent, distinct phenomenon. We employed a 2 (Model Origin: US vs. China) $\times$ 2 (Prompt Language: English vs. Chinese) factorial design across eight multimodal tasks, uniquely incorporating image generation and interpretation to extend analysis beyond textual boundaries. Results revealed inconsistencies with both dominant paradigms: Model origin did not predict cultural alignment, with US models frequently exhibiting ``holistic'' traits typically associated with East Asian data. Similarly, prompt language did not trigger stable cultural frame-switching; instead, we observed \textbf{Cultural Reversal}, where English prompts paradoxically elicited higher contextual attention than Chinese prompts. Crucially, we identified a novel phenomenon termed \textbf{Service Persona Camouflage}: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) collapsed cultural variance in affective tasks into a hyper-positive, zero-variance ``helpful assistant'' persona. We conclude that LLMs do not simulate human culture but exhibit an emergent Machine Culture -- a probabilistic phenomenon shaped by \textit{superposition} in high-dimensional space and \textit{mode collapse} from safety alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17096v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sink or SWIM: Tackling Real-Time ASR at Scale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17097</link><description>arXiv:2601.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time automatic speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into interactive applications, from voice assistants to live transcription services. However, scaling these systems to support multiple concurrent clients while maintaining low latency and high accuracy remains a major challenge. In this work, we present SWIM, a novel real-time ASR system built on top of OpenAI's Whisper model that enables true model-level parallelization for scalable, multilingual transcription. SWIM supports multiple concurrent audio streams without modifying the underlying model. It introduces a buffer merging strategy that maintains transcription fidelity while ensuring efficient resource usage. We evaluate SWIM in multi-client settings -- scaling up to 20 concurrent users -- and show that it delivers accurate real-time transcriptions in English, Italian, and Spanish, while maintaining low latency and high throughput. While Whisper-Streaming achieves a word error rate of approximately 8.2% with an average delay of approximately 3.4 s in a single-client, English-only setting, SWIM extends this capability to multilingual, multi-client environments. It maintains comparable accuracy with significantly lower delay -- around 2.4 s with 5 clients -- and continues to scale effectively up to 20 concurrent clients without degrading transcription quality and increasing overall throughput. Our approach advances scalable ASR by improving robustness and efficiency in dynamic, multi-user environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17097v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Performance uncertainty in medical image analysis: a large-scale investigation of confidence intervals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17103</link><description>arXiv:2601.17103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance uncertainty quantification is essential for reliable validation and eventual clinical translation of medical imaging artificial intelligence (AI). Confidence intervals (CIs) play a central role in this process by indicating how precise a reported performance estimate is. Yet, due to the limited amount of work examining CI behavior in medical imaging, the community remains largely unaware of how many diverse CI methods exist and how they behave in specific settings. The purpose of this study is to close this gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis across a total of 24 segmentation and classification tasks, using 19 trained models per task group, a broad spectrum of commonly used performance metrics, multiple aggregation strategies, and several widely adopted CI methods. Reliability (coverage) and precision (width) of each CI method were estimated across all settings to characterize their dependence on study characteristics. Our analysis revealed five principal findings: 1) the sample size required for reliable CIs varies from a few dozens to several thousands of cases depending on study parameters; 2) CI behavior is strongly affected by the choice of performance metric; 3) aggregation strategy substantially influences the reliability of CIs, e.g. they require more observations for macro than for micro; 4) the machine learning problem (segmentation versus classification) modulates these effects; 5) different CI methods are not equally reliable and precise depending on the use case. These results form key components for the development of future guidelines on reporting performance uncertainty in medical imaging AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StealthMark: Harmless and Stealthy Ownership Verification for Medical Segmentation via Uncertainty-Guided Backdoors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17107</link><description>arXiv:2601.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Annotating medical data for training AI models is often costly and limited due to the shortage of specialists with relevant clinical expertise. This challenge is further compounded by privacy and ethical concerns associated with sensitive patient information. As a result, well-trained medical segmentation models on private datasets constitute valuable intellectual property requiring robust protection mechanisms. Existing model protection techniques primarily focus on classification and generative tasks, while segmentation models-crucial to medical image analysis-remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel, stealthy, and harmless method, StealthMark, for verifying the ownership of medical segmentation models under black-box conditions. Our approach subtly modulates model uncertainty without altering the final segmentation outputs, thereby preserving the model's performance. To enable ownership verification, we incorporate model-agnostic explanation methods, e.g. LIME, to extract feature attributions from the model outputs. Under specific triggering conditions, these explanations reveal a distinct and verifiable watermark. We further design the watermark as a QR code to facilitate robust and recognizable ownership claims. We conducted extensive experiments across four medical imaging datasets and five mainstream segmentation models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and harmlessness of our method on the original model's segmentation performance. For example, when applied to the SAM model, StealthMark consistently achieved ASR above 95% across various datasets while maintaining less than a 1% drop in Dice and AUC scores, significantly outperforming backdoor-based watermarking methods and highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Mamba-assisted neural network framework incorporating self-attention mechanism to achieve improved channel estimation with low complexity for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms, particularly for configurations with a large number of subcarriers. With the integration of customized Mamba architecture, the proposed framework handles large-scale subcarrier channel estimation efficiently while capturing long-distance dependencies among these subcarriers effectively. Unlike conventional Mamba structure, this paper implements a bidirectional selective scan to improve channel estimation performance, because channel gains at different subcarriers are non-causal. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibits relatively lower space complexity than transformer-based neural networks. Simulation results tested on the 3GPP TS 36.101 channel demonstrate that compared to other baseline neural network solutions, the proposed method achieves improved channel estimation performance with a reduced number of tunable parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17108v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Authority Signals in AI Cited Health Sources: A Framework for Evaluating Source Credibility in ChatGPT Responses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17109</link><description>arXiv:2601.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health information seeking has fundamentally changed since the onset of Large Language Models (LLM), with nearly one third of ChatGPT's 800 million users asking health questions weekly. Understanding the sources of those AI generated responses is vital, as health organizations and providers are also investing in digital strategies to organically improve their ranking, reach and visibility in LLM systems like ChatGPT. As AI search optimization strategies are gaining maturity, this study introduces an Authority Signals Framework, organized in four domains that reflect key components to health information seeking, starting with "Who wrote it?" (Author Credentials), followed by "Who published it?" (Institutional Affiliation), "How was it vetted?" (Quality Assurance), and "How does AI find it?" (Digital Authority). This descriptive cross-sectional study randomly selected 100 questions from HealthSearchQA which contains 3,173 consumer health questions curated by Google Research from publicly available search engine suggestions. Those questions were entered into ChatGPT 5.2 Pro to record and code the cited sources through the lens of the Authority Signals Framework's four domains. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all cited sources (n=615), and cross tabulations were conducted to examine distinction among organization types. Over 75% of the sources cited in ChatGPT's health generated responses were from established institutional sources, such as Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Wikipedia, National Health Service, PubMed with the remaining citations sourced from alternative health information sources that lacked established institutional backing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17109v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Forecasting Energy Consumption using Recurrent Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17110</link><description>arXiv:2601.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate short-term energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient power grid management, resource allocation, and market stability. Traditional time-series models often fail to capture the complex, non-linear dependencies and external factors affecting energy demand. In this study, we propose a forecasting approach based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their advanced variant, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our methodology integrates historical energy consumption data with external variables, including temperature, humidity, and time-based features. The LSTM model is trained and evaluated on a publicly available dataset, and its performance is compared against a conventional feed-forward neural network baseline. Experimental results show that the LSTM model substantially outperforms the baseline, achieving lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning models in providing reliable and precise short-term energy forecasts for real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17110v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism: Load Balancing An Imbalanced Mixture-of-Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17111</link><description>arXiv:2601.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are typically pre-trained with explicit load-balancing constraints to ensure statistically balanced expert routing. Despite this, we observe that even well-trained MoE models exhibit significantly imbalanced routing. This behavior is arguably natural-and even desirable - as imbalanced routing allows models to concentrate domain-specific knowledge within a subset of experts. Expert parallelism (EP) is designed to scale MoE models by distributing experts across multiple devices, but with a less-discussed assumption of balanced routing. Under extreme imbalance, EP can funnel a disproportionate number of tokens to a small number of experts, leading to compute- and memory-bound failures on overloaded devices during post-training or inference, where explicit load balancing is often inapplicable. We propose Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism (LLEP), a novel EP algorithm that dynamically reroutes excess tokens and associated expert parameters from overloaded devices to underutilized ones. This ensures that all devices complete their workloads within the minimum collective latency while respecting memory constraints. Across different model scales, LLEP achieves up to 5x speedup and 4x reduction in peak memory usage compared to standard EP. This enables faster and higher-throughput post-training and inference, with ~1.9x faster for gpt-oss-120b. We support our method with extensive theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations, including ablation studies. These results illuminate key trade-offs and enable a principled framework for hardware-specific hyper-parameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17111v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Low-Rank Tensor Approximation of Weights in Large Language Models via Cosine Lanczos Bidiagonalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17112</link><description>arXiv:2601.17112v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We introduce and explore a new multimodal input representation for vision-language models: acoustic field video. Unlike conventional video (RGB with stereo/mono audio), our video stream provides a spatially grounded visualization of sound intensity across a scene, offering a new and powerful dimension of perceptual understanding. Our real-time pipeline uses low-cost beamforming microphone arrays that are already common in smart speakers and increasingly present in robotics and XR headsets, yet this sensing capability remains unutilized for scene understanding. To assess the value of spatial acoustic information, we constructed an evaluation set of 402 question-answer scenes, comparing a state-of-the-art VLM given conventional video with and without paired acoustic field video. Results show a clear and consistent improvement when incorporating spatial acoustic data; the VLM we test improves from 38.3% correct to 67.4%. Our findings highlight that many everyday scene understanding tasks remain underconstrained when relying solely on visual and audio input, and that acoustic field data provides a promising and practical direction for multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: The field of image generation is currently bifurcated into autoregressive (AR) models operating on discrete tokens and diffusion models utilizing continuous latents. This divide, rooted in the distinction between VQ-VAEs and VAEs, hinders unified modeling and fair benchmarking. Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) offers a theoretical bridge, yet vanilla FSQ suffers from a critical flaw: its equal-interval quantization can cause activation collapse. This mismatch forces a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and information efficiency. In this work, we resolve this dilemma by simply replacing the activation function in original FSQ with a distribution-matching mapping to enforce a uniform prior. Termed iFSQ, this simple strategy requires just one line of code yet mathematically guarantees both optimal bin utilization and reconstruction precision. Leveraging iFSQ as a controlled benchmark, we uncover two key insights: (1) The optimal equilibrium between discrete and continuous representations lies at approximately 4 bits per dimension. (2) Under identical reconstruction constraints, AR models exhibit rapid initial convergence, whereas diffusion models achieve a superior performance ceiling, suggesting that strict sequential ordering may limit the upper bounds of generation quality. Finally, we extend our analysis by adapting Representation Alignment (REPA) to AR models, yielding LlamaGen-REPA.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the standard tool for encoding data and their complex relationships into continuous representations, improving prediction accuracy in several machine learning tasks like node classification and link prediction. However, their use in sensitive applications has raised concerns about the potential leakage of training data. Research on privacy leakage in GNNs has largely been shaped by findings from non-graph domains, such as images and tabular data. We emphasize the need of graph specific analysis and investigate the impact of graph structure on node level membership inference. We formalize MI over node-neighbourhood tuples and investigate two important dimensions: (i) training graph construction and (ii) inference-time edge access. Empirically, snowball's coverage bias often harms generalisation relative to random sampling, while enabling inter-train-test edges at inference improves test accuracy, shrinks the train-test gap, and yields the lowest membership advantage across most of the models and datasets. We further show that the generalisation gap empirically measured as the performance difference between the train and test nodes is an incomplete proxy for MI risk: access to edges dominates-MI can rise or fall independent of gap changes. Finally, we examine the auditability of differentially private GNNs, adapting the definition of statistical exchangeability of train-test data points for graph based models. We show that for node level tasks the inductive splits (random or snowball sampled) break exchangeability, limiting the applicability of standard bounds for membership advantage of differential private models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17130v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Emotion to Expression: Theoretical Foundations and Resources for Fear Speech</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17132</link><description>arXiv:2601.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few forces rival fear in their ability to mobilize societies, distort communication, and reshape collective behavior. In computational linguistics, fear is primarily studied as an emotion, but not as a distinct form of speech. Fear speech content is widespread and growing, and often outperforms hate-speech content in reach and engagement because it appears "civiler" and evades moderation. Yet the computational study of fear speech remains fragmented and under-resourced. This can be understood by recognizing that fear speech is a phenomenon shaped by contributions from multiple disciplines. In this paper, we bridge cross-disciplinary perspectives by comparing theories of fear from Psychology, Political science, Communication science, and Linguistics. Building on this, we review existing definitions. We follow up with a survey of datasets from related research areas and propose a taxonomy that consolidates different dimensions of fear for studying fear speech. By reviewing current datasets and defining core concepts, our work offers both theoretical and practical guidance for creating datasets and advancing fear speech research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Collaborate: An Orchestrated-Decentralized Framework for Peer-to-Peer LLM Federation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17133</link><description>arXiv:2601.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized domains is constrained by a fundamental challenge: the need for diverse, cross-organizational data conflicts with the principles of data privacy and sovereignty. While Federated Learning (FL) provides a framework for collaboration without raw data exchange, its classic centralized form introduces a single point of failure and remains vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Decentralized FL (DFL) mitigates this risk by removing the central aggregator but typically relies on inefficient, random peer-to-peer (P2P) pairings, forming a collaboration graph that is blind to agent heterogeneity and risks negative transfer. This paper introduces KNEXA-FL, a novel framework for orchestrated decentralization that resolves this trade-off. KNEXA-FL employs a non-aggregating Central Profiler/Matchmaker (CPM) that formulates P2P collaboration as a contextual bandit problem, using a LinUCB algorithm on abstract agent profiles to learn an optimal matchmaking policy. It orchestrates direct knowledge exchange between heterogeneous, PEFT-based LLM agents via secure distillation, without ever accessing the models themselves. Our comprehensive experiments on a challenging code generation task show that KNEXA-FL yields substantial gains, improving Pass@1 by approx. 50% relative to random P2P collaboration. Critically, our orchestrated approach demonstrates stable convergence, in stark contrast to a powerful centralized distillation baseline which suffers from catastrophic performance collapse. Our work establishes adaptive, learning-based orchestration as a foundational principle for building robust and effective decentralized AI ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17133v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deconstructing Taste: Toward a Human-Centered AI Framework for Modeling Consumer Aesthetic Perceptions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17134</link><description>arXiv:2601.17134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling consumers' stylistic taste such as "sporty" is crucial for creating designs that truly connect with target audiences. However, capturing taste during the design process remains challenging because taste is abstract and subjective, and preference data alone provides limited guidance for concrete design decisions. This paper proposes an integrated human-centered computational framework that links subjective evaluations (e.g., perceived luxury of car wheels) with domain-specific features (e.g., spoke configuration) and computer vision-based measures (e.g., texture). By jointly modeling human-derived (consumer and designer) and machine-extracted features, our framework advances aesthetic assessment by explicitly linking model outcomes to interpretable design features. In particular, it demonstrates how perceptual features, domain-specific design patterns, and consumers' own interpretations of style contribute to aesthetic evaluations.

We present ConceptACT, an extension of Action Chunking with Transformers that leverages episode-level semantic concept annotations during training to improve learning efficiency. Unlike language-conditioned approaches that require semantic input at deployment, ConceptACT uses human-provided concepts (object properties, spatial relationships, task constraints) exclusively during demonstration collection, adding minimal annotation burden. We integrate concepts using a modified transformer architecture in which the final encoder layer implements concept-aware cross-attention, supervised to align with human annotations. Through experiments on two robotic manipulation tasks with logical constraints, we demonstrate that ConceptACT converges faster and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard ACT. Crucially, we show that architectural integration through attention mechanisms significantly outperforms naive auxiliary prediction losses or language-conditioned models. These results demonstrate that properly integrated semantic supervision provides powerful inductive biases for more efficient robot learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17135v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Communication-Avoiding Linear Algebraic Kernel K-Means on GPUs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17136</link><description>arXiv:2601.17136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is an important tool in data analysis, with K-means being popular for its simplicity and versatility. However, it cannot handle non-linearly separable clusters. Kernel K-means addresses this limitation but requires a large kernel matrix, making it computationally and memory intensive. Prior work has accelerated Kernel K-means by formulating it using sparse linear algebra primitives and implementing it on a single GPU. However, that approach cannot run on datasets with more than approximately 80,000 samples due to limited GPU memory.
  In this work, we address this issue by presenting a suite of distributed-memory parallel algorithms for large-scale Kernel K-means clustering on multi-GPU systems. Our approach maps the most computationally expensive components of Kernel K-means onto communication-efficient distributed linear algebra primitives uniquely tailored for Kernel K-means, enabling highly scalable implementations that efficiently cluster million-scale datasets. Central to our work is the design of partitioning schemes that enable communication-efficient composition of the linear algebra primitives that appear in Kernel K-means.
  Our 1.5D algorithm consistently achieves the highest performance, enabling Kernel K-means to scale to data one to two orders of magnitude larger than previously practical. On 256 GPUs, it achieves a geometric mean weak scaling efficiency of $79.7\%$ and a geometric mean strong scaling speedup of $4.2\times$. Compared to our 1D algorithm, the 1.5D approach achieves up to a $3.6\times$ speedup on 256 GPUs and reduces clustering time from over an hour to under two seconds relative to a single-GPU sliding window implementation. Our results show that distributed algorithms designed with application-specific linear algebraic formulations can achieve substantial performance improvement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17136v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bowling Online: Accounting for Civil Society Reshaped into Streamlined Photons within a Fiber Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17139</link><description>arXiv:2601.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Civil society has been deemed by various scholars, such as Robert D. Putnam, to be a predictor and a cornerstone of a robust and consolidated democracy (Putnam et al., 1993). Putnam highlights in his book Bowling Alone (2000) that American civil society has become weaker: people organize less, and literally, they bowl alone. But what if there is yet another aspect to Putnam's story that has not been fully accounted for, namely the rise of Digital Civil Society (DCS)? Perhaps people in the third decade of the 21st century bowl online. They still organize, mobilize, and care for their civil liberties and democratic institutions; however, the public sphere in which this takes place has shifted online to cyberspace (Bernholz et al., 2013) or to what still needs to be conceptualized, the digital public sphere (DPS), which this article attempts to measure and demarcate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17139v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring EEG-driven brain-heart coupling across sleep stages in individuals with sleep disorders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17149</link><description>arXiv:2601.17149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between the brain and heart during sleep are responsible for regulating autonomic function. While brain-heart coupling has been studied in healthy populations, the relationships between neural and cardiac activity across sleep stages in the presence of sleep disorders are not clear. This study examines the influence of brain-driven cardiac activity across sleep stages for individuals with sleep disorders. Overnight recordings of C3 and C4 electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from 146 individuals were preprocessed and analyzed in the frequency domain through a linear mixed-effect model. Our results show that parasympathetic activity is sensitive to changes in delta and beta powers during later stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as both band powers exhibited strong negative effects on high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) power. These findings show that neural activity can drive vagal tone across sleep stages, suggesting that treatments on key EEG bands during NREM and REM stages may help restore regular cardiac behaviour.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17149v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling medical imaging report generation with multimodal reinforcement learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17151</link><description>arXiv:2601.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning with natural-language text, but they still exhibit major competency gaps in multimodal understanding and reasoning especially in high-value verticals such as biomedicine. Medical imaging report generation is a prominent example. Supervised fine-tuning can substantially improve performance, but they are prone to overfitting to superficial boilerplate patterns. In this paper, we introduce Universal Report Generation (UniRG) as a general framework for medical imaging report generation. By leveraging reinforcement learning as a unifying mechanism to directly optimize for evaluation metrics designed for end applications, UniRG can significantly improve upon supervised fine-tuning and attain durable generalization across diverse institutions and clinical practices. We trained UniRG-CXR on publicly available chest X-ray (CXR) data and conducted a thorough evaluation in CXR report generation with rigorous evaluation scenarios. On the authoritative ReXrank benchmark, UniRG-CXR sets new overall SOTA, outperforming prior state of the art by a wide margin.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Role Assignment for Multi-Agent Debate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17152</link><description>arXiv:2601.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) and vision-language model (VLM) debate systems employ specialized roles for complex problem-solving, yet model specializations are not leveraged to decide which model should fill which role. We propose dynamic role assignment, a framework that runs a Meta-Debate to select suitable agents before the actual debate. The meta-debate has two stages: (1) proposal, where candidates provide role-tailored arguments, and (2) peer review, where proposals are scored with data and role-specific criteria to choose the best agent for each position. We evaluate our method on LLM problem solving benchmarks. Applied on top of existing debate systems, our approach consistently outperforms uniform assignments (filling all roles with the same model) by up to 74.8% and random assignments (assigning models to roles without considering their suitability) by up to 29.7%, depending on the task and the specific assignment. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-agent system design, shifting from static agent deployment to dynamic and capability-aware selection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17152v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Set-Based Reachability for Low-Thrust Spacecraft in Two-Body and Cislunar Dynamical Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17155</link><description>arXiv:2601.17155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of zonotope-based reachability analysis to low-thrust spacecraft in both two-body and cislunar environments. Reachable sets are generated under two-body and circular restricted three-body (CR3BP) dynamics using set-based methods that approximate nonlinear systems via Taylor expansions. A state-dependent coefficient (SDC) parameterization is also explored to represent nonlinear dynamics in a pseudo-linear form, enabling efficient matrix based propagation of reachable sets. Applications include Earth-Mars transfer and cislunar scenarios such as L1 and L2 Halo orbits and Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs). The resulting reachable sets are used for safe trajectory generation and tracking, with comparisons drawn between model predictive control (MPC) and LQR-based station-keeping. The proposed approach provides a scalable framework for analyzing spacecraft behavior under complex dynamics and control constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17155v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpretability of the Intent Detection Problem: A New Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17156</link><description>arXiv:2601.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intent detection, a fundamental text classification task, aims to identify and label the semantics of user queries, playing a vital role in numerous business applications. Despite the dominance of deep learning techniques in this field, the internal mechanisms enabling Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to solve intent detection tasks are poorly understood. In this work, we apply dynamical systems theory to analyze how RNN architectures address this problem, using both the balanced SNIPS and the imbalanced ATIS datasets. By interpreting sentences as trajectories in the hidden state space, we first show that on the balanced SNIPS dataset, the network learns an ideal solution: the state space, constrained to a low-dimensional manifold, is partitioned into distinct clusters corresponding to each intent. The application of this framework to the imbalanced ATIS dataset then reveals how this ideal geometric solution is distorted by class imbalance, causing the clusters for low-frequency intents to degrade. Our framework decouples geometric separation from readout alignment, providing a novel, mechanistic explanation for real world performance disparities. These findings provide new insights into RNN dynamics, offering a geometric interpretation of how dataset properties directly shape a network's computational solution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autonomous Mars Rover Module for Soil Sampling and Life Component Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17158</link><description>arXiv:2601.17158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial life has long been a primary focus of scientific exploration, driven by rapid advancements in technology and our understanding of the universe. The discovery of water on Mars has sparked significant interest, raising the question of whether life could exist on the planet. This study proposes a novel approach to simulate and illustrate the detection of life using a proof-of-life module integrated into a Mars rover. The module is an autonomous system capable of traveling to designated regions, excavating soil, collecting samples, and performing biochemical testing onboard the rover itself. The project is inherently multidisciplinary, integrating mechanical systems such as a drill mechanism and a vacuum system, alongside biochemical analysis for soil testing. The module is capable of successfully detecting the presence or absence of living components of life from the collected soil particles. This proof-of-life module serves as a proof-of-concept for autonomous life detection in extraterrestrial environments and lays the foundation for future exploration missions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17158v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpreting Agentic Systems: Beyond Model Explanations to System-Level Accountability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17168</link><description>arXiv:2601.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic systems have transformed how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to create autonomous systems with goal-directed behaviors, consisting of multi-step planning and the ability to interact with different environments. These systems differ fundamentally from traditional machine learning models, both in architecture and deployment, introducing unique AI safety challenges, including goal misalignment, compounding decision errors, and coordination risks among interacting agents, that necessitate embedding interpretability and explainability by design to ensure traceability and accountability across their autonomous behaviors. Current interpretability techniques, developed primarily for static models, show limitations when applied to agentic systems. The temporal dynamics, compounding decisions, and context-dependent behaviors of agentic systems demand new analytical approaches. This paper assesses the suitability and limitations of existing interpretability methods in the context of agentic systems, identifying gaps in their capacity to provide meaningful insight into agent decision-making. We propose future directions for developing interpretability techniques specifically designed for agentic systems, pinpointing where interpretability is required to embed oversight mechanisms across the agent lifecycle from goal formation, through environmental interaction, to outcome evaluation. These advances are essential to ensure the safe and accountable deployment of agentic AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17168v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who Gets Which Message?

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating personalized, persuasive text at scale, raising new questions about bias and fairness in automated communication. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of how LLMs behave when tasked with demographic-conditioned targeted messaging. We introduce a controlled evaluation framework using three leading models -- GPT-4o, Llama-3.3, and Mistral-Large 2.1 -- across two generation settings: Standalone Generation, which isolates intrinsic demographic effects, and Context-Rich Generation, which incorporates thematic and regional context to emulate realistic targeting. We evaluate generated messages along three dimensions: lexical content, language style, and persuasive framing. We instantiate this framework on climate communication and find consistent age- and gender-based asymmetries across models: male- and youth-targeted messages emphasize agency, innovation, and assertiveness, while female- and senior-targeted messages stress warmth, care, and tradition. Contextual prompts systematically amplify these disparities, with persuasion scores significantly higher for messages tailored to younger or male audiences. Our findings demonstrate how demographic stereotypes can surface and intensify in LLM-generated targeted communication, underscoring the need for bias-aware generation pipelines and transparent auditing frameworks that explicitly account for demographic conditioning in socially sensitive applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17172v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Factual QA: Mentorship-Oriented Question Answering over Long-Form Multilingual Content</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17173</link><description>arXiv:2601.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question answering systems are typically evaluated on factual correctness, yet many real-world applications-such as education and career guidance-require mentorship: responses that provide reflection and guidance. Existing QA benchmarks rarely capture this distinction, particularly in multilingual and long-form settings. We introduce MentorQA, the first multilingual dataset and evaluation framework for mentorship-focused question answering from long-form videos, comprising nearly 9,000 QA pairs from 180 hours of content across four languages. We define mentorship-focused evaluation dimensions that go beyond factual accuracy, capturing clarity, alignment, and learning value. Using MentorQA, we compare Single-Agent, Dual-Agent, RAG, and Multi-Agent QA architectures under controlled conditions. Multi-Agent pipelines consistently produce higher-quality mentorship responses, with especially strong gains for complex topics and lower-resource languages. We further analyze the reliability of automated LLM-based evaluation, observing substantial variation in alignment with human judgments. Overall, this work establishes mentorship-focused QA as a distinct research problem and provides a multilingual benchmark for studying agentic architectures and evaluation design in educational AI. The dataset and evaluation framework are released at https://github.com/AIM-SCU/MentorQA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17173v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TrojanGYM: A Detector-in-the-Loop LLM for Adaptive RTL Hardware Trojan Insertion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17178</link><description>arXiv:2601.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware Trojans (HTs) remain a critical threat because learning-based detectors often overfit to narrow trigger/payload patterns and small, stylized benchmarks. We introduce TrojanGYM, an agentic, LLM-driven framework that automatically curates HT insertions to expose detector blind spots while preserving design correctness. Given high-level HT specifications, a suite of cooperating LLM agents (instantiated with GPT-4, LLaMA-3.3-70B, and Gemini-2.5Pro) proposes and refines RTL modifications that realize diverse triggers and payloads without impacting normal functionality. TrojanGYM implements a feedback-driven benchmark generation loop co-designed with HT detectors, in which constraint-aware syntactic checking and GNN-based HT detectors provide feedback that iteratively refines HT specifications and insertion strategies to better surface detector blind spots. We further propose Robust-GNN4TJ, a new implementation of the GNN4TJ with improved graph extraction, training robustness, and prediction reliability, especially on LLM-generated HT designs. On the most challenging TrojanGYM-generated benchmarks, Robust-GNN4TJ raises HT detection rates from 0% to 60% relative to a prior GNN-based detector. We instantiate TrojanGYM on SRAM, AES-128, and UART designs at RTL level, and show that it systematically produces diverse, functionally correct HTs that reach up to 83.33% evasion rates against modern GNN-based detectors, revealing robustness gaps that are not apparent when these detectors are evaluated solely on existing TrustHub-style benchmarks. Post peer-review, we will release all codes and artifacts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17178v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conservative &amp; Aggressive NaNs Accelerate U-Nets for Neuroimaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17180</link><description>arXiv:2601.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for neuroimaging increasingly rely on large architectures, making efficiency a persistent concern despite advances in hardware. Through an analysis of numerical uncertainty of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we observe that many operations are applied to values dominated by numerical noise and have negligible influence on model outputs. In some models, up to two-thirds of convolution operations appear redundant. We introduce Conservative &amp; Aggressive NaNs, two novel variants of max pooling and unpooling that identify numerically unstable voxels and replace them with NaNs, allowing subsequent layers to skip computations on irrelevant data. Both methods are implemented within PyTorch and require no architectural changes. We evaluate these approaches on four CNN models spanning neuroimaging and image classification tasks. For inputs containing at least 50% NaNs, we observe consistent runtime improvements; for data with more than two-thirds NaNs )common in several neuroimaging settings) we achieve an average inference speedup of 1.67x. Conservative NaNs reduces convolution operations by an average of 30% across models and datasets, with no measurable performance degradation, and can skip up to 64.64% of convolutions in specific layers. Aggressive NaNs can skip up to 69.30% of convolutions but may occasionally affect performance. Overall, these methods demonstrate that numerical uncertainty can be exploited to reduce redundant computation and improve inference efficiency in CNNs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17180v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Proximal Optimization for Privacy-Preserving Heart Disease Prediction: A Controlled Simulation Study on Non-IID Clinical Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17183</link><description>arXiv:2601.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare institutions have access to valuable patient data that could be of great help in the development of improved diagnostic models, but privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR prevent hospitals from directly sharing data with one another. Federated Learning offers a way out to this problem by facilitating collaborative model training without having the raw patient data centralized. However, clinical datasets intrinsically have non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) features brought about by demographic disparity and diversity in disease prevalence and institutional practices. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation research of Federated Proximal Optimization (FedProx) for Heart Disease prediction based on UCI Heart Disease dataset. We generate realistic non-IID data partitions by simulating four heterogeneous hospital clients from the Cleveland Clinic dataset (303 patients), by inducing statistical heterogeneity by demographic-based stratification. Our experimental results show that FedProx with proximal parameter mu=0.05 achieves 85.00% accuracy, which is better than both centralized learning (83.33%) and isolated local models (78.45% average) without revealing patient privacy. Through generous sheer ablation studies with statistical validation on 50 independent runs we demonstrate that proximal regularization is effective in curbing client drift in heterogeneous environments. This proof-of-concept research offers algorithmic insights and practical deployment guidelines for real-world federated healthcare systems, and thus, our results are directly transferable to hospital IT-administrators, implementing privacy-preserving collaborative learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17183v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-Rate Quantized Matrix Multiplication: Theory and Practice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17187</link><description>arXiv:2601.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the problem of quantized matrix multiplication (MatMul), which has become crucial for the efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). We consider two settings: 1) Generic MatMul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $\Sigma_X$ of its columns. For each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. Specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax INT and floating-point (FP) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. Weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (WMSE) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector. We show how waterfilling can be used to improve practical LLM quantization algorithms (GPTQ), which at present allocate rate equally. This new scheme (termed ``WaterSIC'') only uses scalar INT quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $\Sigma_X$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\frac{2\pi e}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!). GPTQ's performance is affected by the choice of basis, but for a random rotation and actual $\Sigma_X$ from Llama-3-8B we find GPTQ to be within 0.1 bit (depending on the layer type) of WaterSIC, suggesting that GPTQ with random rotation is also near optimal (for high-rate quantization).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17187v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Implementing Tensor Logic: Unifying Datalog and Neural Reasoning via Tensor Contraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17188</link><description>arXiv:2601.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unification of symbolic reasoning and neural networks remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. Symbolic systems offer reliability and interpretability but lack scalability, while neural networks provide learning capabilities but sacrifice transparency. Tensor Logic, proposed by Domingos, suggests that logical rules and Einstein summation are mathematically equivalent, offering a principled path toward unification. This paper provides empirical validation of this framework through three experiments. First, we demonstrate the equivalence between recursive Datalog rules and iterative tensor contractions by computing the transitive closure of a biblical genealogy graph containing 1,972 individuals and 1,727 parent-child relationships, converging in 74 iterations to discover 33,945 ancestor relationships. Second, we implement reasoning in embedding space by training a neural network with learnable transformation matrices, demonstrating successful zero-shot compositional inference on held-out queries. Third, we validate the Tensor Logic superposition construction on FB15k-237, a large-scale knowledge graph with 14,541 entities and 237 relations. Using Domingos's relation matrix formulation $R_r = E^\top A_r E$, we achieve MRR of 0.3068 on standard link prediction and MRR of 0.3346 on a compositional reasoning benchmark where direct edges are removed during training, demonstrating that matrix composition enables multi-hop inference without direct training examples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17188v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Benchmarks for Differentially Private Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17189</link><description>arXiv:2601.17189v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: This chapter examines the global governance of artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of the Global AI Divide, focusing on disparities in AI development, innovation, and regulation. It highlights systemic inequities in education, digital infrastructure, and access to decision-making processes, perpetuating a dependency and exclusion cycle for Global Majority countries. The analysis also explores the dominance of Western nations and corporations in shaping AI governance frameworks, which often sideline the unique priorities and contexts of the Global Majority. Additionally, this chapter identifies emerging countertrends, such as national and regional AI strategies, as potential avenues for fostering equity and inclusivity in global AI governance. The chapter concludes with actionable recommendations to democratize AI governance for Majority World countries, emphasizing the importance of systemic reforms, resource redistribution, and meaningful participation. It calls for collaborative action to ensure AI governance becomes a catalyst for shared prosperity, addressing global disparities rather than deepening them.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17191v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PUNCH: Physics-informed Uncertainty-aware Network for Coronary Hemodynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17192</link><description>arXiv:2601.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) affects millions worldwide yet remains underdiagnosed because gold-standard physiological measurements are invasive and variably reproducible. We introduce a non-invasive, uncertainty-aware framework for estimating coronary flow reserve (CFR) directly from standard angiography. The system integrates physics-informed neural networks with variational inference to infer coronary blood flow from first-principles models of contrast transport, without requiring ground-truth flow measurements. The pipeline runs in approximately three minutes per patient on a single GPU, with no population-level training.
  Using 1{,}000 synthetic spatiotemporal intensity maps (kymographs) with controlled noise and artifacts, the framework reliably identifies degraded data and outputs appropriately inflated uncertainty estimates, showing strong correspondence between predictive uncertainty and error (Pearson $r = 0.997$, Spearman $\rho = 0.998$). Clinical validation in 12 patients shows strong agreement between PUNCH-derived CFR and invasive bolus thermodilution (Pearson $r = 0.90$, $p = 6.3 \times 10^{-5}$). We focus on the LAD, the artery most commonly assessed in routine CMD testing. Probabilistic CFR estimates have confidence intervals narrower than the variability of repeated invasive measurements.
  By transforming routine angiography into quantitative, uncertainty-aware assessment, this approach enables scalable, safer, and more reproducible evaluation of coronary microvascular function. Because standard angiography is widely available globally, the framework could expand access to CMD diagnosis and establish a new paradigm for physics-informed, patient-specific inference from clinical imaging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17192v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust and learning-augmented algorithms for degradation-aware battery optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17193</link><description>arXiv:2601.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of maximizing revenue from a grid-scale battery energy storage system, accounting for uncertain future electricity prices and the effect of degradation on battery lifetime. We formulate this task as an online resource allocation problem. We propose an algorithm, based on online mirror descent, that is no-regret in the stochastic i.i.d. setting and attains finite asymptotic competitive ratio in the adversarial setting (robustness). When untrusted advice about the opportunity cost of degradation is available, we propose a learning-augmented algorithm that performs well when the advice is accurate (consistency) while still retaining robustness properties when the advice is poor.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17193v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoding Psychological States Through Movement: Inferring Human Kinesic Functions with Application to Built Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17194</link><description>arXiv:2601.17194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social infrastructure and other built environments are increasingly expected to support well-being and community resilience by enabling social interaction. Yet in civil and built-environment research, there is no consistent and privacy-preserving way to represent and measure socially meaningful interaction in these spaces, leaving studies to operationalize "interaction" differently across contexts and limiting practitioners' ability to evaluate whether design interventions are changing the forms of interaction that social capital theory predicts should matter. To address this field-level and methodological gap, we introduce the Dyadic User Engagement DataseT (DUET) dataset and an embedded kinesics recognition framework that operationalize Ekman and Friesen's kinesics taxonomy as a function-level interaction vocabulary aligned with social capital-relevant behaviors (e.g., reciprocity and attention coordination). DUET captures 12 dyadic interactions spanning all five kinesic functions-emblems, illustrators, affect displays, adaptors, and regulators-across four sensing modalities and three built-environment contexts, enabling privacy-preserving analysis of communicative intent through movement. Benchmarking six open-source, state-of-the-art human activity recognition models quantifies the difficulty of communicative-function recognition on DUET and highlights the limitations of ubiquitous monadic, action-level recognition when extended to dyadic, socially grounded interaction measurement. Building on DUET, our recognition framework infers communicative function directly from privacy-preserving skeletal motion without handcrafted action-to-function dictionaries; using a transfer-learning architecture, it reveals structured clustering of kinesic functions and a strong association between representation quality and classification performance while generalizing across subjects and contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17194v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AstroTimer: Rethinking Non-Access Stratum Timers in LEO Constellations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17195</link><description>arXiv:2601.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations expand 5G coverage to remote regions but differ fundamentally from terrestrial networks due to rapidly changing topologies, fluctuating delays, and constrained onboard resources. Existing 3GPP Non-Access Stratum (NAS) timers, inherited from terrestrial and geostationary (GEO) or medium Earth orbit (MEO) systems, fail to accommodate these dynamics, leading to signaling storms and inefficiency. This paper introduces AstroTimer, a lightweight, adaptive framework for sizing NAS timers based on LEO-specific parameters such as link variability, processing delays, and network-function placement. AstroTimer derives a closed-form timer model with low computational cost and optimizes both watchdog and backoff timers for the 5G registration procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that AstroTimer significantly reduces registration time, retry frequency, and user equipment (UE) energy consumption compared to 3GPP defaults, while preventing signaling overloads. The proposed approach provides an operator-ready foundation for reliable, efficient, and scalable non-terrestrial 5G/6G deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17195v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning Beyond Literal: Cross-style Multimodal Reasoning for Figurative Language Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17197</link><description>arXiv:2601.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in literal multimodal tasks such as visual mathematics and science question answering. However, figurative language, such as sarcasm, humor, and metaphor, remains a significant challenge, as it conveys intent and emotion through subtle incongruities between expressed and intended meanings. In multimodal settings, accompanying images can amplify or invert textual meaning, demanding models that reason across modalities and account for subjectivity. We propose a three-step framework for developing efficient multimodal reasoning models that can (i) interpret multimodal figurative language, (ii) provide transparent reasoning traces, and (iii) generalize across multiple figurative styles. Experiments across four styles show that (1) incorporating reasoning traces substantially improves multimodal figurative understanding, (2) reasoning learned in one style can transfer to others, especially between related styles like sarcasm and humor, and (3) training jointly across styles yields a generalized reasoning VLM that outperforms much larger open- and closed-source models. Our findings show that lightweight VLMs with verifiable reasoning achieve robust cross-style generalization while providing inspectable reasoning traces for multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Modern models for common NLP tasks often employ machine learning techniques and train on journalistic, social media, or other culturally-derived text. These have recently been scrutinized for racial and gender biases, rooting from inherent bias in their training text. These biases are often sub-optimal and recent work poses methods to rectify them; however, these biases may shed light on actual racial or gender gaps in the culture(s) that produced the training text, thereby helping us understand cultural context through big data. This paper presents an approach for quantifying gender bias in word embeddings, and then using them to characterize statistical gender gaps in education, politics, economics, and health. We validate these metrics on 2018 Twitter data spanning 51 U.S. regions and 99 countries. We correlate state and country word embedding biases with 18 international and 5 U.S.-based statistical gender gaps, characterizing regularities and predictive strength.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17203v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SpecBridge: Bridging Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Representations via Cross-Modal Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17204</link><description>arXiv:2601.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-molecule identification from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) remains a bottleneck in untargeted settings where spectral libraries are incomplete. While deep learning offers a solution, current approaches typically fall into two extremes: explicit generative models that construct molecular graphs atom-by-atom, or joint contrastive models that learn cross-modal subspaces from scratch. We introduce SpecBridge, a novel implicit alignment framework that treats structure identification as a geometric alignment problem. SpecBridge fine-tunes a self-supervised spectral encoder (DreaMS) to project directly into the latent space of a frozen molecular foundation model (ChemBERTa), and then performs retrieval by cosine similarity to a fixed bank of precomputed molecular embeddings. Across MassSpecGym, Spectraverse, and MSnLib benchmarks, SpecBridge improves top-1 retrieval accuracy by roughly 20-25% relative to strong neural baselines, while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. These results suggest that aligning to frozen foundation models is a practical, stable alternative to designing new architectures from scratch. The code for SpecBridge is released at https://github.com/HassounLab/SpecBridge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17204v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NewPINNs: Physics-Informing Neural Networks Using Conventional Solvers for Partial Differential Equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17207</link><description>arXiv:2601.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NewPINNs, a physics-informing learning framework that couples neural networks with conventional numerical solvers for solving differential equations. Rather than enforcing governing equations and boundary conditions through residual-based loss terms, NewPINNs integrates the solver directly into the training loop and defines learning objectives through solver-consistency. The neural network produces candidate solution states that are advanced by the numerical solver, and training minimizes the discrepancy between the network prediction and the solver-evolved state. This pull-push interaction enables the network to learn physically admissible solutions through repeated exposure to the solver's action, without requiring problem-specific loss engineering or explicit evaluation of differential equation residuals. By delegating the enforcement of physics, boundary conditions, and numerical stability to established numerical solvers, NewPINNs mitigates several well-known failure modes of standard physics-informed neural networks, including optimization pathologies, sensitivity to loss weighting, and poor performance in stiff or nonlinear regimes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across multiple forward and inverse problems involving finite volume, finite element, and spectral solvers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Polynomial Chaos-based Input Shaper Design under Time-Varying Uncertainty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17209</link><description>arXiv:2601.17209v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We propose a feedforward input-shaping framework with online parameter estimation for unknown second-order systems.

The adaptive input shaping scheme accounts for the system's periodic switching behavior and enables reference shaping even when initial switching instants are missed.

Abstract: We adapt structural complexity analysis to three-dimensional signals, with an emphasis on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This framework captures the multiscale organization of volumetric data by coarse-graining the signal at progressively larger spatial scales and quantifying the information lost between successive resolutions. While the traditional block-based approach can become unstable at coarse resolutions due to limited sampling, we introduce a sliding-window coarse-graining scheme that provides smoother estimates and improved robustness at large scales. Using this refined method, we analyze large structural MRI datasets spanning mid- to late adulthood and find that structural complexity decreases systematically with age, with the strongest effects emerging at coarser scales. These findings highlight structural complexity as a reliable signal processing tool for multiscale analysis of 3D imaging data, while also demonstrating its utility in predicting biological age from brain MRI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17211v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DF-RAG: Query-Aware Diversity for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17212</link><description>arXiv:2601.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common technique for grounding language model outputs in domain-specific information. However, RAG is often challenged by reasoning-intensive question-answering (QA), since common retrieval methods like cosine similarity maximize relevance at the cost of introducing redundant content, which can reduce information recall. To address this, we introduce Diversity-Focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DF-RAG), which systematically incorporates diversity into the retrieval step to improve performance on complex, reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks. DF-RAG builds upon the Maximal Marginal Relevance framework to select information chunks that are both relevant to the query and maximally dissimilar from each other. A key innovation of DF-RAG is its ability to optimize the level of diversity for each query dynamically at test time without requiring any additional fine-tuning or prior information. We show that DF-RAG improves F1 performance on reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks by 4-10 percent over vanilla RAG using cosine similarity and also outperforms other established baselines. Furthermore, we estimate an Oracle ceiling of up to 18 percent absolute F1 gains over vanilla RAG, of which DF-RAG captures up to 91.3 percent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17212v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] JetFormer: A Scalable and Efficient Transformer for Jet Tagging from Offline Analysis to FPGA Triggers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17215</link><description>arXiv:2601.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JetFormer, a versatile and scalable encoder-only Transformer architecture for particle jet tagging at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Unlike prior approaches that are often tailored to specific deployment regimes, JetFormer is designed to operate effectively across the full spectrum of jet tagging scenarios, from high-accuracy offline analysis to ultra-low-latency online triggering. The model processes variable-length sets of particle features without relying on input of explicit pairwise interactions, yet achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. On the large-scale JetClass dataset, a large-scale JetFormer matches the accuracy of the interaction-rich ParT model (within 0.7%) while using 37.4% fewer FLOPs, demonstrating its computational efficiency and strong generalization. On benchmark HLS4ML 150P datasets, JetFormer consistently outperforms existing models such as MLPs, Deep Sets, and Interaction Networks by 3-4% in accuracy. To bridge the gap to hardware deployment, we further introduce a hardware-aware optimization pipeline based on multi-objective hyperparameter search, yielding compact variants like JetFormer-tiny suitable for FPGA-based trigger systems with sub-microsecond latency requirements. Through structured pruning and quantization, we show that JetFormer can be aggressively compressed with minimal accuracy loss. By unifying high-performance modeling and deployability within a single architectural framework, JetFormer provides a practical pathway for deploying Transformer-based jet taggers in both offline and online environments at the LHC.

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demand real-time collision prediction to ensure road safety and reduce accident severity. Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17216v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluation on Entity Matching in Recommender Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17218</link><description>arXiv:2601.17218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entity matching is a crucial component in various recommender systems, including conversational recommender systems (CRS) and knowledge-based recommender systems. However, the lack of rigorous evaluation frameworks for cross-dataset entity matching impedes progress in areas such as LLM-driven conversational recommendations and knowledge-grounded dataset construction.
  In this paper, we introduce Reddit-Amazon-EM, a novel dataset comprising naturally occurring items from Reddit and the Amazon '23 dataset. Through careful manual annotation, we identify corresponding movies across Reddit-Movies and Amazon'23, two existing recommender system datasets with inherently overlapping catalogs. Leveraging Reddit-Amazon-EM, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art entity matching methods, including rule-based, graph-based, lexical-based, embedding-based, and LLM-based approaches.
  For reproducible research, we release our manually annotated entity matching gold set and provide the mapping between the two datasets using the best-performing method from our experiments. This serves as a valuable resource for advancing future work on entity matching in recommender systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17218v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Advancing Improvisation in Human-Robot Construction Collaboration: Taxonomy and Research Roadmap</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17219</link><description>arXiv:2601.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction industry faces productivity stagnation, skilled labor shortages, and safety concerns. While robotic automation offers solutions, construction robots struggle to adapt to unstructured, dynamic sites. Central to this is improvisation, adapting to unexpected situations through creative problem-solving, which remains predominantly human. In construction's unpredictable environments, collaborative human-robot improvisation is essential for workflow continuity. This research develops a six-level taxonomy classifying human-robot collaboration (HRC) based on improvisation capabilities. Through systematic review of 214 articles (2010-2025), we categorize construction robotics across: Manual Work (Level 0), Human-Controlled Execution (Level 1), Adaptive Manipulation (Level 2), Imitation Learning (Level 3), Human-in-Loop BIM Workflow (Level 4), Cloud-Based Knowledge Integration (Level 5), and True Collaborative Improvisation (Level 6). Analysis reveals current research concentrates at lower levels, with critical gaps in experiential learning and limited progression toward collaborative improvisation. A five-dimensional radar framework illustrates progressive evolution of Planning, Cognitive Role, Physical Execution, Learning Capability, and Improvisation, demonstrating how complementary human-robot capabilities create team performance exceeding individual contributions. The research identifies three fundamental barriers: technical limitations in grounding and dialogic reasoning, conceptual gaps between human improvisation and robotics research, and methodological challenges. We recommend future research emphasizing improved human-robot communication via Augmented/Virtual Reality interfaces, large language model integration, and cloud-based knowledge systems to advance toward true collaborative improvisation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vidformer: Drop-in Declarative Optimization for Rendering Video-Native Query Results</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17221</link><description>arXiv:2601.17221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When interactively exploring video data, video-native querying involves consuming query results as videos, including steps such as compilation of extracted video clips or data overlays. These video-native queries are bottlenecked by rendering, not the execution of the underlying queries. This rendering is currently performed using post-processing scripts that are often slow. This step poses a critical point of friction in interactive video data workloads: even short clips contain thousands of high-definition frames; conventional OpenCV/Python scripts must decode -&gt; transform -&gt; encode the entire data stream before a single pixel appears, leaving users waiting for many seconds, minutes, or hours.
  To address these issues, we present Vidformer, a drop-in rendering accelerator for video-native querying which, (i) transparently lifts existing visualization code into a declarative representation, (ii) transparently optimizes and parallelizes rendering, and (iii) instantly serves videos through a Video on Demand protocol with just-in-time segment rendering. We demonstrate that Vidformer cuts full-render time by 2-3x across diverse annotation workloads, and, more critically, drops time-to-playback to 0.25-0.5s. This represents a 400x improvement that decouples clip length from first-frame playback latency, and unlocks the ability to perform interactive video-native querying with sub-second latencies. Furthermore, we show how our approach enables interactive video-native LLM-based conversational querying as well.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17221v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
