Abstract: The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) produces complex technical specifications essential to global telecommunications, yet their hierarchical structure, dense formatting, and multi-modal content make them difficult to process. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, existing approaches fall short in handling complex queries, visual information, and document interdependencies. We present TelcoAI, an agentic, multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored for 3GPP documentation. TelcoAI introduces section-aware chunking, structured query planning, metadata-guided retrieval, and multi-modal fusion of text and diagrams. Evaluated on multiple benchmarks-including expert-curated queries-our system achieves $87\%$ recall, $83\%$ claim recall, and $92\%$ faithfulness, representing a $16\%$ improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of agentic and multi-modal reasoning in technical document understanding, advancing practical solutions for real-world telecommunications research and engineering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16984v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking Task Impasses Quickly: Adaptive Neuro-Symbolic Learning for Open-World Robotics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16985</link><description>arXiv:2601.16985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting to unforeseen novelties in open-world environments remains a major challenge for autonomous systems. While hybrid planning and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches show promise, they often suffer from sample inefficiency, slow adaptation, and catastrophic forgetting. We present a neuro-symbolic framework integrating hierarchical abstractions, task and motion planning (TAMP), and reinforcement learning to enable rapid adaptation in robotics. Our architecture combines symbolic goal-oriented learning and world model-based exploration to facilitate rapid adaptation to environmental changes. Validated in robotic manipulation and autonomous driving, our approach achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and superior robustness over state-of-the-art hybrid methods, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16985v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Crystal-KV: Efficient KV Cache Management for Chain-of-Thought LLMs via Answer-First Principle</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16986</link><description>arXiv:2601.16986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) significantly improves accuracy on complex tasks, yet incurs excessive memory overhead due to the long think-stage sequences stored in the Key-Value (KV) cache. Unlike traditional generation tasks where all tokens are uniformly important, CoT emphasizes the final answer, rendering conventional KV compression strategies ineffective. In this paper, we present Crystal-KV, an efficient KV cache management framework tailored for CoT reasoning. Our key insight is the answer-first principle. By mapping answer preferences into think-stage attention map, we distinguish between SlipKV, which mainly maintains the reasoning flow but may occasionally introduce misleading context, and CrystalKV, which truly contributes to the correctness of the final answer. Next, we propose an attention-based Least Recently Frequently Used algorithm. It precisely identifies when a SlipKV entry's utility expires and evicts it, retaining CrystalKV without disrupting reasoning flow. Finally, we introduce an adaptive cache budget allocation algorithm. Based on the dynamic proportion of CrystalKV, it estimates the importance of each layer/head and adjusts the KV cache budget during inference, amplifying critical components to improve budget utilization. Results show that Crystal-KV achieves state-of-the-art KV cache compression, significantly improves throughput, and enables faster response time, while maintaining, or even improving, answer accuracy for CoT reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Reward Model Generalization via Pairwise Maximum Discrepancy Competitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16987</link><description>arXiv:2601.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models, yet their practical effectiveness hinges on generalization to unseen prompts and shifting distributions. Most existing RM evaluations rely on static, pre-annotated preference datasets, which provide limited coverage and often fail to faithfully assess generalization in open-world settings. We introduce Pairwise Maximum Discrepancy Competition (PMDC), a dynamic and annotation-efficient framework for evaluating RM generalization using a large, unlabeled, open-domain prompt pool. PMDC actively selects prompt--response pairs that maximize disagreement between two RMs, yielding a compact set of highly contentious test cases. These cases are adjudicated by an oracle, and the resulting outcomes are aggregated via a Bradley--Terry model to produce a global ranking and pairwise win-rate landscape of RMs. We apply PMDC to re-evaluate 10 representative RMs and observe substantial rank reshuffling compared with conventional benchmarks. Qualitative analyses further uncover systematic generalization failures, providing valuable insights for improving reward modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16987v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated Classification of Research Papers Toward Sustainable Development Goals: A Boolean Query-Based Computational Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16988</link><description>arXiv:2601.16988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of scholarly publications across diverse disciplines has made it increasingly difficult to systematically evaluate how research contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Domain classification of research articles done manually through research experts is extremely impractical because of the number of publications, expensive in time and may not be consistent when done by human beings. This paper proposes an automated and rule-based computational model of classifying research papers based on SDGs with expert curated Boolean query mappings to overcome these challenges. The proposed system has a web-based interface to input data and display results, a backend application programming interface to do high throughput processing, and a Python-based classification engine which uses structured Boolean expressions to process bibliographic metadata (titles, abstracts, and keywords). The framework can be used to support single-paper-based classification and batch-based classification as well as offer clear and understandable outputs that clearly show what query parts motivated each SDG assignment. The experimental testing on massive bibliographic data sets has shown that the system can process thousands of research records in an hour with reproducible and consistent results. The proposed approach provides a viable solution to institutions, researchers and policymakers who are interested in analysis of research alignment with the goal of sustainability in a systematic fashion that would not involve the use of machine learning models whose inputs and outputs are not easily understandable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16988v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] pyBiblioNet: a Python library for a comprehensive network-based bibliometric analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16990</link><description>arXiv:2601.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bibliometric analysis is a critical tool for understanding the structure, dynamics, and impact of scientific research. Traditional methods often fall short in capturing the intricate relationships and evolving trends within scientific literature. To address this gap, we present pyBiblioNet, a Python library designed to facilitate comprehensive network-based bibliometric analysis, providing insights into citation networks, co-authorship networks, and keyword co-occurrence networks. The library integrates with OpenAlex, a popular and open catalogue to the global research system, enabling users to easily preprocess, visualize, and analyse bibliometric data. Key features include topic selection, automatic data download via OpenAlex APIs, creation of the root and base sets of manuscripts to analyze, creation of the citation and co-authorship networks, network visualization tools, and a suite of algorithms for computing network centralities, clustering, and community detection, all of them tailored to the bibliometric domain. Additionally, it enables the analysis of key topics and concepts using NLP techniques. We showcase the main functions of the library by performing a bibliometric analysis on the multidisciplinary "15-minute city paradigm", demonstrating the utility of pyBiblioNet in uncovering hidden patterns and emerging trends in various scientific domains. pyBiblioNet can empower researchers, librarians, and policymakers with a powerful, user-friendly tool for enhancing their bibliometric analyses and making data-driven decisions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16990v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparsity-Aware Low-Rank Representation for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16991</link><description>arXiv:2601.16991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained language models to downstream tasks often entails fine-tuning millions of parameters or deploying costly dense weight updates, which hinders their use in resource-constrained environments. Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduces trainable parameters by factorizing weight updates, yet the underlying dense weights still impose high storage and computation costs. Magnitude-based pruning can yield sparse models but typically degrades LoRA's performance when applied naively. In this paper, we introduce SALR (Sparsity-Aware Low-Rank Representation), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that unifies low-rank adaptation with sparse pruning under a rigorous mean-squared-error framework. We prove that statically pruning only the frozen base weights minimizes the pruning error bound, and we recover the discarded residual information via a truncated-SVD low-rank adapter, which provably reduces per-entry MSE by a factor of $(1 - r/\min(d,k))$. To maximize hardware efficiency, we fuse multiple low-rank adapters into a single concatenated GEMM, and we adopt a bitmap-based encoding with a two-stage pipelined decoding + GEMM design to achieve true model compression and speedup. Empirically, SALR attains 50\% sparsity on various LLMs while matching the performance of LoRA on GSM8K and MMLU, reduces model size by $2\times$, and delivers up to a $1.7\times$ inference speedup.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16991v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BibAgent: An Agentic Framework for Traceable Miscitation Detection in Scientific Literature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16993</link><description>arXiv:2601.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citations are the bedrock of scientific authority, yet their integrity is compromised by widespread miscitations: ranging from nuanced distortions to fabricated references. Systematic citation verification is currently unfeasible; manual review cannot scale to modern publishing volumes, while existing automated tools are restricted by abstract-only analysis or small-scale, domain-specific datasets in part due to the "paywall barrier" of full-text access. We introduce BibAgent, a scalable, end-to-end agentic framework for automated citation verification. BibAgent integrates retrieval, reasoning, and adaptive evidence aggregation, applying distinct strategies for accessible and paywalled sources. For paywalled references, it leverages a novel Evidence Committee mechanism that infers citation validity via downstream citation consensus. To support systematic evaluation, we contribute a 5-category Miscitation Taxonomy and MisciteBench, a massive cross-disciplinary benchmark comprising 6,350 miscitation samples spanning 254 fields. Our results demonstrate that BibAgent outperforms state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) baselines in citation verification accuracy and interpretability, providing scalable, transparent detection of citation misalignments across the scientific literature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16993v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Dataset of Dengue Hospitalizations in Brazil (1999 to 2021) with Weekly Disaggregation from Monthly Counts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16994</link><description>arXiv:2601.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This data paper describes and publicly releases this dataset (v1.0.0), published on Zenodo under DOI 10.5281/zenodo.18189192. Motivated by the need to increase the temporal granularity of originally monthly data to enable more effective training of AI models for epidemiological forecasting, the dataset harmonizes municipal-level dengue hospitalization time series across Brazil and disaggregates them to weekly resolution (epidemiological weeks) through an interpolation protocol with a correction step that preserves monthly totals. The statistical and temporal validity of this disaggregation was assessed using a high-resolution reference dataset from the state of Sao Paulo (2024), which simultaneously provides monthly and epidemiological-week counts, enabling a direct comparison of three strategies: linear interpolation, jittering, and cubic spline. Results indicated that cubic spline interpolation achieved the highest adherence to the reference data, and this strategy was therefore adopted to generate weekly series for the 1999 to 2021 period. In addition to hospitalization time series, the dataset includes a comprehensive set of explanatory variables commonly used in epidemiological and environmental modeling, such as demographic density, CH4, CO2, and NO2 emissions, poverty and urbanization indices, maximum temperature, mean monthly precipitation, minimum relative humidity, and municipal latitude and longitude, following the same temporal disaggregation scheme to ensure multivariate compatibility. The paper documents the datasets provenance, structure, formats, licenses, limitations, and quality metrics (MAE, RMSE, R2, KL, JSD, DTW, and the KS test), and provides usage recommendations for multivariate time-series analysis, environmental health studies, and the development of machine learning and deep learning models for outbreak forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16994v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty Quantification for Named Entity Recognition via Full-Sequence and Subsequence Conformal Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16999</link><description>arXiv:2601.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) serves as a foundational component in many natural language processing (NLP) pipelines. However, current NER models typically output a single predicted label sequence without any accompanying measure of uncertainty, leaving downstream applications vulnerable to cascading errors. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for adapting sequence-labeling-based NER models to produce uncertainty-aware prediction sets. These prediction sets are collections of full-sentence labelings that are guaranteed to contain the correct labeling with a user-specified confidence level. This approach serves a role analogous to confidence intervals in classical statistics by providing formal guarantees about the reliability of model predictions. Our method builds on conformal prediction, which offers finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. We design efficient nonconformity scoring functions to construct efficient, well-calibrated prediction sets that support both unconditional and class-conditional coverage. This framework accounts for heterogeneity across sentence length, language, entity type, and number of entities within a sentence. Empirical experiments on four NER models across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the broad applicability, validity, and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16999v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Investigating Self-regulated Learning Sequences within a Generative AI-based Intelligent Tutoring System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17000</link><description>arXiv:2601.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing trend in employing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) techniques to support learning. Moreover, scholars have reached a consensus on the critical role of self-regulated learning (SRL) in ensuring learning effectiveness within GenAI-assisted learning environments, making it essential to capture students' dynamic SRL patterns. In this study, we extracted students' interaction patterns with GenAI from trace data as they completed a problem-solving task within a GenAI-assisted intelligent tutoring system. Students' purpose of using GenAI was also analyzed from the perspective of information processing, i.e., information acquisition and information transformation. Using sequential and clustering analysis, this study classified participants into two groups based on their SRL sequences. These two groups differed in the frequency and temporal characteristics of GenAI use. In addition, most students used GenAI for information acquisition rather than information transformation, while the correlation between the purpose of using GenAI and learning performance was not statistically significant. Our findings inform both pedagogical design and the development of GenAI-assisted learning environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17000v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lex Reformatica: Five Principles of Policy Reform for the Technological Age</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17001</link><description>arXiv:2601.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twenty-five years ago, Joel Reidenberg argued that technology itself, not just law and regulation, imposes rules on communities in the Information Society. System design choices like network architecture and configurations create regulatory norms he termed "Lex Informatica"-referencing the merchant-driven medieval "Lex Mercatoria" that emerged independent of sovereign control. Today we face different challenges requiring us to revisit Reidenberg's insights and examine the consequences of that earlier era. While Lex Informatica provided a framework for analyzing the internet's birth, we now confront the aftereffects of decades of minimal or absent regulation. Critical questions emerge: When technological social norms develop outside clear legal restraints, who benefits and who suffers? This new era demands infrastructural reform focused on the interplay between public and private regulation and self-regulation, weighing both costs and benefits. Rather than showcasing the promise of yesterday's internet age, today's events reveal the pitfalls of information libertarianism and underscore the urgent need for new approaches to information regulation. This Issue presents articles from two symposiums-one on Lex Informatica and another on race and technology law. Their conversation is now essential. Together, these papers demonstrate what I call the "Lex Reformatica" of today's digital age. This collection shows why scholars, lawyers, and legislators must return to Reidenberg's foundational work and update its trajectory toward a reform-focused approach designed for our current era.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAM-SD: Retrieval-Augmented Multi-agent framework for Sarcasm Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17002</link><description>arXiv:2601.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sarcasm detection remains a significant challenge due to its reliance on nuanced contextual understanding, world knowledge, and multi-faceted linguistic cues that vary substantially across different sarcastic expressions. Existing approaches, from fine-tuned transformers to large language models, apply a uniform reasoning strategy to all inputs, struggling to address the diverse analytical demands of sarcasm. These demands range from modeling contextual expectation violations to requiring external knowledge grounding or recognizing specific rhetorical patterns. To address this limitation, we introduce RAM-SD, a Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent framework for Sarcasm Detection. The framework operates through four stages: (1) contextual retrieval grounds the query in both sarcastic and non-sarcastic exemplars; (2) a meta-planner classifies the sarcasm type and selects an optimal reasoning plan from a predefined set; (3) an ensemble of specialized agents performs complementary, multi-view analysis; and (4) an integrator synthesizes these analyses into a final, interpretable judgment with a natural language explanation. Evaluated on four standard benchmarks, RAM-SD achieves a state-of-the-art Macro-F1 of 77.74%, outperforming the strong GPT-4o+CoC baseline by 7.01 points. Our framework not only sets a new performance benchmark but also provides transparent and interpretable reasoning traces, illuminating the cognitive processes behind sarcasm comprehension.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17002v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Simulations: What 20,000 Real Conversations Reveal About Mental Health AI Safety</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17003</link><description>arXiv:2601.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for mental health support, yet existing safety evaluations rely primarily on small, simulation-based test sets that have an unknown relationship to the linguistic distribution of real usage. In this study, we present replications of four published safety test sets targeting suicide risk assessment, harmful content generation, refusal robustness, and adversarial jailbreaks for a leading frontier generic AI model alongside an AI purpose built for mental health support. We then propose and conduct an ecological audit on over 20,000 real-world user conversations with the purpose-built AI designed with layered suicide and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) safeguards to compare test set performance to real world performance. While the purpose-built AI was significantly less likely than general-purpose LLMs to produce enabling or harmful content across suicide/NSSI (.4-11.27% vs 29.0-54.4%), eating disorder (8.4% vs 54.0%), and substance use (9.9% vs 45.0%) benchmark prompts, test set failure rates for suicide/NSSI were far higher than in real-world deployment. Clinician review of flagged conversations from the ecological audit identified zero cases of suicide risk that failed to receive crisis resources. Across all 20,000 conversations, three mentions of NSSI risk (.015%) did not trigger a crisis intervention; among sessions flagged by the LLM judge, this corresponds to an end-to-end system false negative rate of .38%, providing a lower bound on real-world safety failures. These findings support a shift toward continuous, deployment-relevant safety assurance for AI mental-health systems rather than limited set benchmark certification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17003v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MathMixup: Boosting LLM Mathematical Reasoning with Difficulty-Controllable Data Synthesis and Curriculum Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17006</link><description>arXiv:2601.17006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematical reasoning tasks, the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on high-quality training data with clearly defined and well-graded difficulty levels. However, existing data synthesis methods often suffer from limited diversity and lack precise control over problem difficulty, making them insufficient for supporting efficient training paradigms such as curriculum learning. To address these challenges, we propose MathMixup, a novel data synthesis paradigm that systematically generates high-quality, difficulty-controllable mathematical reasoning problems through hybrid and decomposed strategies. Automated self-checking and manual screening are incorporated to ensure semantic clarity and a well-structured difficulty gradient in the synthesized data. Building on this, we construct the MathMixupQA dataset and design a curriculum learning strategy that leverages these graded problems, supporting flexible integration with other datasets. Experimental results show that MathMixup and its curriculum learning strategy significantly enhance the mathematical reasoning performance of LLMs. Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average score of 52.6\% across seven mathematical benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. These results fully validate the effectiveness and broad applicability of MathMixup in improving the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs and advancing data-centric curriculum learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17006v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analysis of voice recordings features for Classification of Parkinson's Disease</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17007</link><description>arXiv:2601.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease. Early diagnosis is essential to mitigate the progressive deterioration of patients' quality of life. The most characteristic motor symptoms are very mild in the early stages, making diagnosis difficult. Recent studies have shown that the use of patient voice recordings can aid in early diagnosis. Although the analysis of such recordings is costly from a clinical point of view, advances in machine learning techniques are making the processing of this type of data increasingly accurate and efficient. Vocal recordings contain many features, but it is not known whether all of them are relevant for diagnosing the disease.
  This paper proposes the use of different types of machine learning models combined with feature selection methods to detect the disease. The selection techniques allow to reduce the number of features used by the classifiers by determining which ones provide the most information about the problem. The results show that machine learning methods, in particular neural networks, are suitable for PD classification and that the number of features can be significantly reduced without affecting the performance of the models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Robust Financial Trading with Adversarial Synthetic Market Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17008</link><description>arXiv:2601.17008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading relies on machine learning models to make trading decisions. Despite strong in-sample performance, these models often degrade when confronted with evolving real-world market regimes, which can shift dramatically due to macroeconomic changes-e.g., monetary policy updates or unanticipated fluctuations in participant behavior. We identify two challenges that perpetuate this mismatch: (1) insufficient robustness in existing policy against uncertainties in high-level market fluctuations, and (2) the absence of a realistic and diverse simulation environment for training, leading to policy overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian Robust Framework that systematically integrates a macro-conditioned generative model with robust policy learning. On the data side, to generate realistic and diverse data, we propose a macro-conditioned GAN-based generator that leverages macroeconomic indicators as primary control variables, synthesizing data with faithful temporal, cross-instrument, and macro correlations. On the policy side, to learn robust policy against market fluctuations, we cast the trading process as a two-player zero-sum Bayesian Markov game, wherein an adversarial agent simulates shifting regimes by perturbing macroeconomic indicators in the macro-conditioned generator, while the trading agent-guided by a quantile belief network-maintains and updates its belief over hidden market states. The trading agent seeks a Robust Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium via Bayesian neural fictitious self-play, stabilizing learning under adversarial market perturbations. Extensive experiments on 9 financial instruments demonstrate that our framework outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines. In extreme events like the COVID, our method shows improved profitability and risk management, offering a reliable solution for trading under uncertain and shifting market dynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17008v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimizing the Landscape of LLM Embeddings with Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis for Generative Psychometrics: A Monte Carlo Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17010</link><description>arXiv:2601.17010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) embeddings are increasingly used to estimate dimensional structure in psychological item pools prior to data collection, yet current applications treat embeddings as static, cross-sectional representations. This approach implicitly assumes uniform contribution across all embedding coordinates and overlooks the possibility that optimal structural information may be concentrated in specific regions of the embedding space. This study reframes embeddings as searchable landscapes and adapts Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis (DynEGA) to systematically traverse embedding coordinates, treating the dimension index as a pseudo-temporal ordering analogous to intensive longitudinal trajectories. A large-scale Monte Carlo simulation embedded items representing five dimensions of grandiose narcissism using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model, generating network estimations across systematically varied item pool sizes (3-40 items per dimension) and embedding depths (3-1,298 dimensions). Results reveal that Total Entropy Fit Index (TEFI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) leads to competing optimization trajectories across the embedding landscape. TEFI achieves minima at deep embedding ranges (900--1,200 dimensions) where entropy-based organization is maximal but structural accuracy degrades, whereas NMI peaks at shallow depths where dimensional recovery is strongest but entropy-based fit remains suboptimal. Single-metric optimization produces structurally incoherent solutions, whereas a weighted composite criterion identifies embedding dimensions depth regions that jointly balance accuracy and organization. Optimal embedding depth scales systematically with item pool size. These findings establish embedding landscapes as non-uniform semantic spaces requiring principled optimization rather than default full-vector usage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Digital Divide in Geriatric Care: Why Usability, Not Access, is the Real Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17012</link><description>arXiv:2601.17012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in the world's aging population to 16% by the year 2050 spurs the need for the application of digital health solutions to enhance older individuals' independence, accessibility, and well-being. While digital health technologies such as telemedicine, wearables, and mobile health applications can transform geriatric care, their adoption among older individuals is not evenly distributed. This study redefines the "digital divide" among older health care as a usability divide, contends that user experience (UX) poor design is the primary adoption barrier, rather than access. Drawing on interdisciplinary studies and design paradigms, the research identifies the main challenges: visual, cognitive, and motor impairment; complicated interfaces; and lack of co-creation with older adults, and outlines how participatory, user-focused, and inclusive notions of design can transcend them. Findings reveal that older persons easily embrace those technologies that are intuitive, accessible, and socially embedded as they promote autonomy, confidence, and equity in health. The study identifies the effects of the design attributes of high-contrast screens, lower interaction flow, multimodal feedback, and caregiver integration as having strong influences on usability outcomes. In addition, it critiques the current accessibility guidelines as being technically oriented rather than experiential and demands an ethical, empathetic understanding of design grounded in human-centered usability rather than technical accessibility in itself.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17012v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Private Accountability in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17013</link><description>arXiv:2601.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Article, I explore the impending conflict between the protection of civil rights and artificial intelligence (AI). While both areas of law have amassed rich and well-developed areas of scholarly work and doctrinal support, a growing body of scholars are interrogating the intersection between them. This Article argues that the issues surrounding algorithmic accountability demonstrate a deeper, more structural tension within a new generation of disputes regarding law and technology. As I argue, the true promise of AI does not lie in the information we reveal to one another, but rather in the questions it raises about the interaction of technology, property, and civil rights. For this reason, I argue that we are looking in the wrong place if we look only to the state to address issues of algorithmic accountability. Instead, we must turn to other ways to ensure more transparency and accountability that stem from private industry, rather than public regulation. The issue of algorithmic bias represents a crucial new world of civil rights concerns, one that is distinct in nature from the ones that preceded it. Since we are in a world where the activities of private corporations, rather than the state, are raising concerns about privacy, due process, and discrimination, we must focus on the role of private corporations in addressing the issue. Towards this end, I discuss a variety of tools to help eliminate the opacity of AI, including codes of conduct, impact statements, and whistleblower protection, which I argue carries the potential to encourage greater endogeneity in civil rights enforcement. Ultimately, by examining the relationship between private industry and civil rights, we can perhaps develop a new generation of forms of accountability in the process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17013v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Measuring Political Stance and Consistency in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17016</link><description>arXiv:2601.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the incredible advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), many people have started using them to satisfy their information needs. However, utilizing LLMs might be problematic for political issues where disagreement is common and model outputs may reflect training-data biases or deliberate alignment choices. To better characterize such behavior, we assess the stances of nine LLMs on 24 politically sensitive issues using five prompting techniques. We find that models often adopt opposing stances on several issues; some positions are malleable under prompting, while others remain stable. Among the models examined, Grok-3-mini is the most persistent, whereas Mistral-7B is the least. For issues involving countries with different languages, models tend to support the side whose language is used in the prompt. Notably, no prompting technique alters model stances on the Qatar blockade or the oppression of Palestinians. We hope these findings raise user awareness when seeking political guidance from LLMs and encourage developers to address these concerns.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17016v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Organizing Railway Traffic Management</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17017</link><description>arXiv:2601.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving traffic management in case of perturbation is one of the main challenges in today's railway research. The great majority of the existing literature proposes approaches to make centralized decisions to minimize delay propagation. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to the same aim: we design and implement a modular process to allow trains to self-organize. This process consists in having trains identifying their neighbors, formulating traffic management hypotheses, checking their compatibility and selecting the best ones through a consensus mechanism. Finally, these hypotheses are merged into a directly applicable traffic plan. In a thorough experimental analysis on a portion of the Italian network, we compare the results of self-organization with those of a state-of-the-art centralized approach. In particular, we make this comparison mimicking a realistic deployment thanks to a closed-loop framework including a microscopic railway simulator. The results indicate that self-organization achieves better results than the centralized algorithm, specifically thanks to the definition and exploitation of the instance decomposition allowed by the proposed approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17017v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating the Evolution of Critical Thinking, Creativity, Communication and Collaboration in Higher Education Courses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17018</link><description>arXiv:2601.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Creativity, Communication, Critical Thinking, and Collaboration (the 4Cs) is a central objective of contemporary competency-based education. However, empirical evidence on how these competencies evolve across learning modules and instructional phases remains limited. This study evaluates the evolution of the 4Cs from pre-pilot to pilot implementation phases across three educational contexts, using the project's 4Cs theoretical framework as an analytical lens. The analysis of three pilot cases (IASIS, EASD, and UPATRAS) compares the 4Cs scores to identify patterns of growth, stagnation, or decline over time. Results indicate that communication and critical thinking showed the most consistent and substantial improvements, particularly in pilots with lower pre-pilot baselines, suggesting that structured pilot interventions effectively support cognitive and expressive competencies. In contrast, creativity exhibited context-dependent outcomes, while collaboration emerged as the most fragile competency, often stagnating or declining during scale-up. Interpreted through the theoretical framework, these findings suggest that competency evolution is strongly shaped by instructional design, assessment alignment, and learning activity structures rather than learner ability alone. The study contributes empirical validation to the 4Cs framework and highlights the need for differentiated, competency-sensitive design and evaluation strategies when scaling educational modules.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context Lake: A System Class Defined by Decision Coherence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17019</link><description>arXiv:2601.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly the primary consumers of data, operating continuously to make concurrent, irreversible decisions. Traditional data systems designed for human analysis cycles become correctness bottlenecks under this operating regime. When multiple agents operate over shared resources, their actions interact before reconciliation is possible. Correctness guarantees that apply after the decision window therefore fail to prevent conflicts. We introduce the Decision Coherence Law: for agents that take irreversible actions whose effects interact, correctness requires that interacting decisions be evaluated against a coherent representation of reality at the moment they are made. We show that no existing system class satisfies this requirement and prove through the Composition Impossibility Theorem that independently advancing systems cannot be composed to provide Decision Coherence while preserving their native system classes. From this impossibility result, we derive Context Lake as a necessary system class with three requirements: (1) semantic operations as native capabilities, (2) transactional consistency over all decision-relevant state, and (3) operational envelopes bounding staleness and degradation under load. We formalize the architectural invariants, enforcement boundaries, and admissibility conditions required for correctness in collective agent systems. This position paper establishes the theoretical foundation for Context Lakes, identifies why existing architectures fail, and specifies what systems must guarantee for AI agents to operate constructively at scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Do We Engage with Other Disciplines?

Abstract: With the rising popularity of interdisciplinary work and increasing institutional incentives in this direction, there is a growing need to understand how resulting publications incorporate ideas from multiple disciplines. Existing computational approaches, such as affiliation diversity, keywords, and citation patterns, do not account for how individual citations are used to advance the citing work. Although, in line with addressing this gap, prior studies have proposed taxonomies to classify citation purpose, these frameworks are not well-suited to interdisciplinary research and do not provide quantitative measures of citation engagement quality. To address these limitations, we propose a framework for the evaluation of citation engagement in interdisciplinary Natural Language Processing (NLP) publications. Our approach introduces a citation purpose taxonomy tailored to interdisciplinary work, supported by an annotation study. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through a thorough analysis of publications at the intersection of NLP and Computational Social Science.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17020v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-based System for Transforming text and sound to Educational Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17022</link><description>arXiv:2601.17022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological developments have produced methods that can generate educational videos from input text or sound. Recently, the use of deep learning techniques for image and video generation has been widely explored, particularly in education. However, generating video content from conditional inputs such as text or speech remains a challenging area. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to the educational structure, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which develop frame-for-frame frameworks and are able to create full educational videos. The proposed system is structured into three main phases In the first phase, the input (either text or speech) is transcribed using speech recognition. In the second phase, key terms are extracted and relevant images are generated using advanced models such as CLIP and diffusion models to enhance visual quality and semantic alignment. In the final phase, the generated images are synthesized into a video format, integrated with either pre-recorded or synthesized sound, resulting in a fully interactive educational video. The proposed system is compared with other systems such as TGAN, MoCoGAN, and TGANS-C, achieving a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score of 28.75%, which indicates improved visual quality and better over existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17022v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Three Axes of Success: A Three-Dimensional Framework for Career Decision-Making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17023</link><description>arXiv:2601.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Career decision-making is a socio-technical problem: individuals exercise bounded agency while navigating labor market institutions, organizational incentive structures, and information asymmetries that shape feasible trajectories. Existing frameworks optimize along single dimensions - financial returns, work-life balance, or mission alignment - without explicit models for inter-dimensional tradeoffs or temporal dynamics. We propose The Three Axes of Success, a normative decision framework decomposing career trajectories into Wealth (career capital accumulation and economic optionality), Autonomy (control over task selection, temporal allocation, and strategic direction), and Meaning (counterfactual social impact scaled by problem importance and personal replaceability). We formalize coupling dynamics between axes: the adjacent possible mechanism by which skill frontiers enable mission discovery, creating nonlinear Wealth -&gt; Meaning transitions; autonomy prerequisites where insufficient career capital triggers control traps; and dual-career household constraints that yield Pareto-suboptimal Nash equilibria under independent optimization. We operationalize each axis through measurable proxies, analyze prototypical career archetypes - industrial R&amp;amp;D, academia, entrepreneurship - as points in (W, A, M)-space, and derive sequential versus simultaneous optimization strategies under uncertainty. The framework converts implicit career anxiety into explicit multi-objective optimization problems with satisficing thresholds, structuring the human-system interaction between individual deliberation and institutional constraints. This provides the first unified decision-theoretic treatment of career success, integrating insights from human capital theory, self-determination theory, and effective altruism into a coherent architecture for rational career design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17023v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ensuring Computer Science Learning in the AI Era: Open Generative AI Policies and Assignment-Driven Written Quizzes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17024</link><description>arXiv:2601.17024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has created a pressing challenge in computer science (CS) education: how to incorporate powerful AI tools into programming coursework without undermining student learning through cognitive offloading. This paper presents an assessment model that permits the use of generative AI for take-home programming assignments while enforcing individual mastery through immediate, assignment-driven written quizzes. To promote authentic learning, these in-class, closed-book assessments are weighted more heavily than the assignments themselves and are specifically designed to verify the student's comprehension of the algorithms, structure, and implementation details of their submitted code. Preliminary empirical data were collected from an upper-level computer science course to examine the relationship between self-reported GenAI usage and performance on AI-free quizzes, exams, and final course grades. Statistical analyses revealed no meaningful linear correlation between GenAI usage levels and assessment outcomes, with Pearson correlation coefficients consistently near zero. These preliminary results suggest that allowing GenAI for programming assignments does not diminish students' mastery of course concepts when learning is verified through targeted, assignment-driven quizzes. Although limited by a small sample size, this study provides preliminary evidence that the risks of cognitive offloading can be mitigated by allowing AI-assisted programming practice while verifying understanding through assignment-driven, AI-free quizzes. The findings support the responsible adoption of open GenAI policies in upper-level CS courses, when paired with rigorous, independent assessment mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17024v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] (Mis-)Informed Consent: Predatory Apps and the Exploitation of Populations with Limited Literacy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17025</link><description>arXiv:2601.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among populations with limited literacy in emerging digital markets, the adoption of mobile phones, combined with comprehension barriers and poor cybersecurity hygiene, has created hidden privacy risks. This paper examines how informed consent is often abused by predatory financial applications, leading to financial scams that disproportionately affect users with low literacy. We focus on predatory loan, gambling, and trading apps, analyzing a dataset of 50 Google Play Store apps to measure how many omit or obfuscate critical privacy disclosures. We also evaluate comprehension gaps among users with low literacy via a targeted user study and assess whether Large Language Model (LLM)-generated summaries, translations, and visual cues can improve consent clarity. Our findings show that 85% of study participants did not understand basic app permissions, underscoring the urgent need for stronger regulatory oversight and scalable LLM-driven privacy-literacy tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17025v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scientific Image Synthesis: Benchmarking, Methodologies, and Downstream Utility</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17027</link><description>arXiv:2601.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While synthetic data has proven effective for improving scientific reasoning in the text domain, multimodal reasoning remains constrained by the difficulty of synthesizing scientifically rigorous images. Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in a persistent visual-logic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct a systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, a logic-driven framework that follows an explicit "understand - plan - code" workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights a fundamental expressiveness-precision trade-off. Finally, we show that fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on rigorously verified synthetic scientific images yields consistent reasoning gains, with potential scaling trends analogous to the text domain, validating high-fidelity scientific synthesis as a viable path to unlocking massive multimodal reasoning capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17027v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PALMA: A Lightweight Tropical Algebra Library for ARM-Based Embedded Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17028</link><description>arXiv:2601.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical algebra, including max-plus, min-plus, and related idempotent semirings, provides a unifying framework in which many optimization problems that are nonlinear in classical algebra become linear. This property makes tropical methods particularly well suited for shortest paths, scheduling, throughput analysis, and discrete event systems. Despite their theoretical maturity and practical relevance, existing tropical algebra implementations primarily target desktop or server environments and remain largely inaccessible on resource-constrained embedded platforms, where such optimization problems are most acute. We present PALMA (Parallel Algebra Library for Max-plus Applications), a lightweight, dependency-free C library that brings tropical linear algebra to ARM-based embedded systems. PALMA implements a generic semiring abstraction with SIMD-accelerated kernels, enabling a single computational framework to support shortest paths, bottleneck paths, reachability, scheduling, and throughput analysis. The library supports five tropical semirings, dense and sparse (CSR) representations, tropical closure, and spectral analysis via maximum cycle mean computation. We evaluate PALMA on a Raspberry Pi 4 and demonstrate peak performance of 2,274 MOPS, speedups of up to 11.9 times over classical Bellman-Ford for single-source shortest paths, and sub-10 microsecond scheduling solves for real-time control workloads. Case studies in UAV control, IoT routing, and manufacturing systems show that tropical algebra enables efficient, predictable, and unified optimization directly on embedded hardware. PALMA is released as open-source software under the MIT license.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17028v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-Efficient Meningioma Segmentation via Implicit Spatiotemporal Mixing and Sim2Real Semantic Injection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17031</link><description>arXiv:2601.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of medical image segmentation is increasingly defined by the efficiency of data utilization rather than merely the volume of raw data. Accurate segmentation, particularly for complex pathologies like meningiomas, demands that models fully exploit the latent information within limited high-quality annotations. To maximize the value of existing datasets, we propose a novel dual-augmentation framework that synergistically integrates spatial manifold expansion and semantic object injection. Specifically, we leverage Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model continuous velocity fields. Unlike previous methods, we perform linear mixing on the integrated deformation fields, enabling the efficient generation of anatomically plausible variations by interpolating within the deformation space. This approach allows for the extensive exploration of structural diversity from a small set of anchors. Furthermore, we introduce a Sim2Real lesion injection module. This module constructs a high-fidelity simulation domain by transplanting lesion textures into healthy anatomical backgrounds, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic augmentation and real-world pathology. Comprehensive experiments on a hybrid dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the data efficiency and robustness of state-of-the-art models, including nnU-Net and U-Mamba, offering a potent strategy for high-performance medical image analysis with limited annotation budgets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17031v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diagnosis Support of Sickle Cell Anemia by Classifying Red Blood Cell Shape in Peripheral Blood Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17032</link><description>arXiv:2601.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red blood cell (RBC) deformation is the consequence of several diseases, including sickle cell anemia, which causes recurring episodes of pain and severe pronounced anemia. Monitoring patients with these diseases involves the observation of peripheral blood samples under a microscope, a time-consuming procedure. Moreover, a specialist is required to perform this technique, and owing to the subjective nature of the observation of isolated RBCs, the error rate is high. In this paper, we propose an automated method for differentially enumerating RBCs that uses peripheral blood smear image analysis. In this method, the objects of interest in the image are segmented using a Chan-Vese active contour model. An analysis is then performed to classify the RBCs, also called erythrocytes, as normal or elongated or having other deformations, using the basic shape analysis descriptors: circular shape factor (CSF) and elliptical shape factor (ESF). To analyze cells that become partially occluded in a cluster during sample preparation, an elliptical adjustment is performed to allow the analysis of erythrocytes with discoidal and elongated shapes. The images of patient blood samples used in the study were acquired by a clinical laboratory specialist in the Special Hematology Department of the ``Dr. Juan Bruno Zayas'' General Hospital in Santiago de Cuba. A comparison of the results obtained by the proposed method in our experiments with those obtained by some state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed method is superior for the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. This superiority is achieved for evidenced by the obtained F-measure value (0.97 for normal cells and 0.95 for elongated ones) and several overall multiclass performance measures. The results achieved by the proposed method are suitable for the purpose of clinical treatment and diagnostic support of sickle cell anemia.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17032v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-Generated or Human-Written?

Abstract: ArXiv recently prohibited the upload of unpublished review papers to its servers in the Computer Science domain, citing a high prevalence of LLM-generated content in these categories. However, this decision was not accompanied by quantitative evidence. In this work, we investigate this claim by measuring the proportion of LLM-generated content in review vs. non-review research papers in recent years. Using two high-quality detection methods, we find a substantial increase in LLM-generated content across both review and non-review papers, with a higher prevalence in review papers. However, when considering the number of LLM-generated papers published in each category, the estimates of non-review LLM-generated papers are almost six times higher. Furthermore, we find that this policy will affect papers in certain domains far more than others, with the CS subdiscipline Computers &amp; Society potentially facing cuts of 50%. Our analysis provides an evidence-based framework for evaluating such policy decisions, and we release our code to facilitate future investigations at: https://github.com/yanaiela/llm-review-arxiv.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17036v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AMVICC: A Novel Benchmark for Cross-Modal Failure Mode Profiling for VLMs and IGMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17037</link><description>arXiv:2601.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated visual reasoning limitations of both multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models (IGMs) by creating a novel benchmark to systematically compare failure modes across image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, enabling cross-modal evaluation of visual understanding. Despite rapid growth in machine learning, vision language models (VLMs) still fail to understand or generate basic visual concepts such as object orientation, quantity, or spatial relationships, which highlighted gaps in elementary visual reasoning. By adapting MMVP benchmark questions into explicit and implicit prompts, we create \textit{AMVICC}, a novel benchmark for profiling failure modes across various modalities. After testing 11 MLLMs and 3 IGMs in nine categories of visual reasoning, our results show that failure modes are often shared between models and modalities, but certain failures are model-specific and modality-specific, and this can potentially be attributed to various factors. IGMs consistently struggled to manipulate specific visual components in response to prompts, especially in explicit prompts, suggesting poor control over fine-grained visual attributes. Our findings apply most directly to the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art models on structured visual reasoning tasks. This work lays the foundation for future cross-modal alignment studies, offering a framework to probe whether generation and interpretation failures stem from shared limitations to guide future improvements in unified vision-language modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid Deep Feature Extraction and ML for Construction and Demolition Debris Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17038</link><description>arXiv:2601.17038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction industry produces significant volumes of debris, making effective sorting and classification critical for sustainable waste management and resource recovery. This study presents a hybrid vision-based pipeline that integrates deep feature extraction with classical machine learning (ML) classifiers for automated construction and demolition (C\&amp;amp;D) debris classification. A novel dataset comprising 1,800 balanced, high-quality images representing four material categories, Ceramic/Tile, Concrete, Trash/Waste, and Wood was collected from real construction sites in the UAE, capturing diverse real-world conditions. Deep features were extracted using a pre-trained Xception network, and multiple ML classifiers, including SVM, kNN, Bagged Trees, LDA, and Logistic Regression, were systematically evaluated. The results demonstrate that hybrid pipelines using Xception features with simple classifiers such as Linear SVM, kNN, and Bagged Trees achieve state-of-the-art performance, with up to 99.5\% accuracy and macro-F1 scores, surpassing more complex or end-to-end deep learning approaches. The analysis highlights the operational benefits of this approach for robust, field-deployable debris identification and provides pathways for future integration with robotics and onsite automation systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17038v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MANGO: A Global Single-Date Paired Dataset for Mangrove Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17039</link><description>arXiv:2601.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mangroves are critical for climate-change mitigation, requiring reliable monitoring for effective conservation. While deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for mangrove detection, its progress is hindered by the limitations of existing datasets. In particular, many resources provide only annual map products without curated single-date image-mask pairs, limited to specific regions rather than global coverage, or remain inaccessible to the public. To address these challenges, we introduce MANGO, a large-scale global dataset comprising 42,703 labeled image-mask pairs across 124 countries. To construct this dataset, we retrieve all available Sentinel-2 imagery within the year 2020 for mangrove regions and select the best single-date observations that align with the mangrove annual mask. This selection is performed using a target detection-driven approach that leverages pixel-wise coordinate references to ensure adaptive and representative image-mask pairings. We also provide a benchmark across diverse semantic segmentation architectures under a country-disjoint split, establishing a foundation for scalable and reliable global mangrove monitoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17039v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FP-THD: Full page transcription of historical documents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17040</link><description>arXiv:2601.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transcription of historical documents written in Latin in XV and XVI centuries has special challenges as it must maintain the characters and special symbols that have distinct meanings to ensure that historical texts retain their original style and significance. This work proposes a pipeline for the transcription of historical documents preserving these special features. We propose to extend an existing text line recognition method with a layout analysis model. We analyze historical text images using a layout analysis model to extract text lines, which are then processed by an OCR model to generate a fully digitized page. We showed that our pipeline facilitates the processing of the page and produces an efficient result. We evaluated our approach on multiple datasets and demonstrate that the masked autoencoder effectively processes different types of text, including handwritten, printed and multi-language.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17040v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Arabic Sign Language Recognition using Multimodal Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17041</link><description>arXiv:2601.17041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) is an essential communication method for individuals in the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community. However, existing recognition systems face significant challenges due to their reliance on single sensor approaches like Leap Motion or RGB cameras. These systems struggle with limitations such as inadequate tracking of complex hand orientations and imprecise recognition of 3D hand movements. This research paper aims to investigate the potential of a multimodal approach that combines Leap Motion and RGB camera data to explore the feasibility of recognition of ArSL. The system architecture includes two parallel subnetworks: a custom dense neural network for Leap Motion data, incorporating dropout and L2 regularization, and an image subnetwork based on a fine-tuned VGG16 model enhanced with data augmentation techniques. Feature representations from both modalities are concatenated in a fusion model and passed through fully connected layers, with final classification performed via SoftMax activation to analyze spatial and temporal features of hand gestures. The system was evaluated on a custom dataset comprising 18 ArSL words, of which 13 were correctly recognized, yielding an overall accuracy of 78%. These results offer preliminary insights into the viability of multimodal fusion for sign language recognition and highlight areas for further optimization and dataset expansion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpretable and Sparse Linear Attention with Decoupled Membership-Subspace Modeling via MCR2 Objective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17042</link><description>arXiv:2601.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR2)-driven white-box transformer, grounded in structured representation learning, unifies interpretability and efficiency, providing a reliable white-box solution for visual modeling. However, in existing designs, tight coupling between "membership matrix" and "subspace matrix U" in MCR2 causes redundant coding under incorrect token projection. To this end, we decouple the functional relationship between the "membership matrix" and "subspaces U" in the MCR2 objective and derive an interpretable sparse linear attention operator from unrolled gradient descent of the optimized objective. Specifically, we propose to directly learn the membership matrix from inputs and subsequently derive sparse subspaces from the fullspace S. Consequently, gradient unrolling of the optimized MCR2 objective yields an interpretable sparse linear attention operator: Decoupled Membership-Subspace Attention (DMSA). Experimental results on visual tasks show that simply replacing the attention module in Token Statistics Transformer (ToST) with DMSA (we refer to as DMST) not only achieves a faster coding reduction rate but also outperforms ToST by 1.08%-1.45% in top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Compared with vanilla Transformer architectures, DMST exhibits significantly higher computational efficiency and interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17042v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Atomic Depth Estimation From Noisy Electron Microscopy Data Via Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17046</link><description>arXiv:2601.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for extracting 3D atomic-level information from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images affected by significant noise. The approach is based on formulating depth estimation as a semantic segmentation problem. We address the resulting segmentation problem by training a deep convolutional neural network to generate pixel-wise depth segmentation maps using simulated data corrupted by synthetic noise. The proposed method was applied to estimate the depth of atomic columns in CeO2 nanoparticles from simulated images and real-world TEM data. Our experiments show that the resulting depth estimates are accurate, calibrated and robust to noise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17046v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Contrastive Pre-trained Foundation Model for Deciphering Imaging Noisomics across Modalities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17047</link><description>arXiv:2601.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing imaging noise is notoriously data-intensive and device-dependent, as modern sensors entangle physical signals with complex algorithmic artifacts. Current paradigms struggle to disentangle these factors without massive supervised datasets, often reducing noise to mere interference rather than an information resource. Here, we introduce "Noisomics", a framework shifting the focus from suppression to systematic noise decoding via the Contrastive Pre-trained (CoP) Foundation Model. By leveraging the manifold hypothesis and synthetic noise genome, CoP employs contrastive learning to disentangle semantic signals from stochastic perturbations. Crucially, CoP breaks traditional deep learning scaling laws, achieving superior performance with only 100 training samples, outperforming supervised baselines trained on 100,000 samples, thereby reducing data and computational dependency by three orders of magnitude. Extensive benchmarking across 12 diverse out-of-domain datasets confirms its robust zero-shot generalization, demonstrating a 63.8% reduction in estimation error and an 85.1% improvement in the coefficient of determination compared to the conventional training strategy. We demonstrate CoP's utility across scales: from deciphering non-linear hardware-noise interplay in consumer photography to optimizing photon-efficient protocols for deep-tissue microscopy. By decoding noise as a multi-parametric footprint, our work redefines stochastic degradation as a vital information resource, empowering precise imaging diagnostics without prior device calibration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SiMiC: Context-Aware Silicon Microstructure Characterization Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for Field-Emission Tip Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17048</link><description>arXiv:2601.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of silicon microstructures is essential for advancing microscale fabrication, quality control, and device performance. Traditional analysis using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) often requires labor-intensive, manual evaluation of feature geometry, limiting throughput and reproducibility. In this study, we propose SiMiC: Context-Aware Silicon Microstructure Characterization Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for Field-Emission Tip Analysis. By leveraging deep learning, our approach efficiently extracts morphological features-such as size, shape, and apex curvature-from SEM images, significantly reducing human intervention while improving measurement consistency. A specialized dataset of silicon-based field-emitter tips was developed, and a customized CNN architecture incorporating attention mechanisms was trained for multi-class microstructure classification and dimensional prediction. Comparative analysis with classical image processing techniques demonstrates that SiMiC achieves high accuracy while maintaining interpretability. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for data-driven microstructure analysis directly linked to field-emission performance, opening avenues for correlating emitter geometry with emission behavior and guiding the design of optimized cold-cathode and SEM electron sources.

Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the Recognize the Unseen: Unusual Behavior Recognition from Pose Data Challenge, hosted at ISAS 2025. The challenge aims to address the critical need for automated recognition of unusual behaviors in facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities using non-invasive pose estimation data. Participating teams were tasked with distinguishing between normal and unusual activities based on skeleton keypoints extracted from video recordings of simulated scenarios. The dataset reflects real-world imbalance and temporal irregularities in behavior, and the evaluation adopted a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) strategy to ensure subject-agnostic generalization. The challenge attracted broad participation from 40 teams applying diverse approaches ranging from classical machine learning to deep learning architectures. Submissions were assessed primarily using macro-averaged F1 scores to account for class imbalance. The results highlight the difficulty of modeling rare, abrupt actions in noisy, low-dimensional data, and emphasize the importance of capturing both temporal and contextual nuances in behavior modeling. Insights from this challenge may contribute to future developments in socially responsible AI applications for healthcare and behavior monitoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model for Intrinsic Privacy-Preserving Behavioral Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17050</link><description>arXiv:2601.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adverse social interactions, such as bullying, harassment, and other illicit activities, pose significant threats to individual well-being and public safety, leaving profound impacts on physical and mental health. However, these critical events frequently occur in privacy-sensitive environments like restrooms, and changing rooms, where conventional surveillance is prohibited or severely restricted by stringent privacy regulations and ethical concerns. Here, we propose the Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model (SP-VLM), a novel framework that reimagines secure environmental monitoring. It achieves intrinsic privacy-by-design by capturing human dynamics through inherently low-dimensional single-pixel modalities and inferring complex behavioral patterns via seamless vision-language integration. Building on this framework, we demonstrate that single-pixel sensing intrinsically suppresses identity recoverability, rendering state-of-the-art face recognition systems ineffective below a critical sampling rate. We further show that SP-VLM can nonetheless extract meaningful behavioral semantics, enabling robust anomaly detection, people counting, and activity understanding from severely degraded single-pixel observations. Combining these findings, we identify a practical sampling-rate regime in which behavioral intelligence emerges while personal identity remains strongly protected. Together, these results point to a human-rights-aligned pathway for safety monitoring that can support timely intervention without normalizing intrusive surveillance in privacy-sensitive spaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17050v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synthetic Data Guided Feature Selection for Robust Activity Recognition in Older Adults</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17053</link><description>arXiv:2601.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical activity during hip fracture rehabilitation is essential for mitigating long-term functional decline in geriatric patients. However, it is rarely quantified in clinical practice. Existing continuous monitoring systems with commercially available wearable activity trackers are typically developed in middle-aged adults and therefore perform unreliably in older adults with slower and more variable gait patterns. This study aimed to develop a robust human activity recognition (HAR) system to improve continuous physical activity recognition in the context of hip fracture rehabilitation. 24 healthy older adults aged over 80 years were included to perform activities of daily living (walking, standing, sitting, lying down, and postural transfers) under simulated free-living conditions for 75 minutes while wearing two accelerometers positioned on the lower back and anterior upper thigh. Model robustness was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The synthetic data demonstrated potential to improve generalization across participants. The resulting feature intervention model (FIM), aided by synthetic data guidance, achieved reliable activity recognition with mean F1-scores of 0.896 for walking, 0.927 for standing, 0.997 for sitting, 0.937 for lying down, and 0.816 for postural transfers. Compared with a control condition model without synthetic data, the FIM significantly improved the postural transfer detection, i.e., an activity class of high clinical relevance that is often overlooked in existing HAR literature. In conclusion, these preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of robust activity recognition in older adults. Further validation in hip fracture patient populations is required to assess the clinical utility of the proposed monitoring system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17053v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Failing on Bias Mitigation: Investigating Why Predictive Models Struggle with Government Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17054</link><description>arXiv:2601.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for bias and unfairness in AI-supporting government services raises ethical and legal concerns. Using crime rate prediction with the Bristol City Council data as a case study, we examine how these issues persist. Rather than auditing real-world deployed systems, our goal is to understand why widely adopted bias mitigation techniques often fail when applied to government data. Our findings reveal that bias mitigation approaches applied to government data are not always effective -- not because of flaws in model architecture or metric selection, but due to the inherent properties of the data itself. Through comparing a set of comprehensive models and fairness methods, our experiments consistently show that the mitigation efforts cannot overcome the embedded unfairness in the data -- further reinforcing that the origin of bias lies in the structure and history of government datasets. We then explore the reasons for the mitigation failures in predictive models on government data and highlight the potential sources of unfairness posed by data distribution shifts, the accumulation of historical bias, and delays in data release. We also discover the limitations of the blind spots in fairness analysis and bias mitigation methods when only targeting a single sensitive feature through a set of intersectional fairness experiments. Although this study is limited to one city, the findings are highly suggestive, which can contribute to an early warning that biases in government data may persist even with standard mitigation methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI, Metacognition, and the Verification Bottleneck: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study of Human Problem-Solving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17055</link><description>arXiv:2601.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This longitudinal pilot study tracked how generative AI reshapes problem-solving over six months across three waves in an academic setting. AI integration reached saturation by Wave 3, with daily use rising from 52.4% to 95.7% and ChatGPT adoption from 85.7% to 100%. A dominant hybrid workflow increased 2.7-fold, adopted by 39.1% of participants. The verification paradox emerged: participants relied most heavily on AI for difficult tasks (73.9%) yet showed declining verification confidence (68.1%) where performance was worst (47.8% accuracy on complex tasks). Objective performance declined systematically: 95.2% to 81.0% to 66.7% to 47.8% across problem difficulty, with belief-performance gaps widening to 34.6 percentage points. This indicates a fundamental shift where verification, not solution generation, became the bottleneck in human-AI problem-solving. The ACTIVE Framework synthesizes findings grounded in cognitive load theory: Awareness and task-AI alignment, Critical verification protocols, Transparent human-in-the-loop integration, Iterative skill development countering cognitive offloading, Verification confidence calibration, and Ethical evaluation. The authors provide implementation pathways for institutions and practitioners. Key limitations include sample homogeneity (academic cohort only, convenience sampling) limiting generalizability to corporate, clinical, or regulated professional contexts; self-report bias in confidence measures (32.2 percentage point divergence from objective performance); lack of control conditions; restriction to mathematical/analytical problems; and insufficient timeframe to assess long-term skill trajectories. Results generalize primarily to early-adopter, academically affiliated populations. Causal validation requires randomized controlled trials.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17055v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ego4OOD: Rethinking Egocentric Video Domain Generalization via Covariate Shift Scoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17056</link><description>arXiv:2601.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Egocentric video action recognition under domain shifts remains challenging due to large intra-class spatio-temporal variability, long-tailed feature distributions, and strong correlations between actions and environments. Existing benchmarks for egocentric domain generalization often conflate covariate shifts with concept shifts, making it difficult to reliably evaluate a model's ability to generalize across input distributions. To address this limitation, we introduce Ego4OOD, a domain generalization benchmark derived from Ego4D that emphasizes measurable covariate diversity while reducing concept shift through semantically coherent, moment-level action categories. Ego4OOD spans eight geographically distinct domains and is accompanied by a clustering-based covariate shift metric that provides a quantitative proxy for domain difficulty. We further leverage a one-vs-all binary training objective that decomposes multi-class action recognition into independent binary classification tasks. This formulation is particularly well-suited for covariate shift by reducing interference between visually similar classes under feature distribution shift. Using this formulation, we show that a lightweight two-layer fully connected network achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art egocentric domain generalization methods on both Argo1M and Ego4OOD, despite using fewer parameters and no additional modalities. Our empirical analysis demonstrates a clear relationship between measured covariate shift and recognition performance, highlighting the importance of controlled benchmarks and quantitative domain characterization for studying out-of-distribution generalization in egocentric video.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17056v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Frequency-aware Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17057</link><description>arXiv:2601.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisited the role of data augmentation in contrastive learning for sequential recommendation, revealing its inherent bias against low-frequency items and sparse user behaviors. To address this limitation, we proposed FACL, a frequency-aware adaptive contrastive learning framework that introduces micro-level adaptive perturbation to protect the integrity of rare items, as well as macro-level reweighting to amplify the influence of sparse and rare-interaction sequences during training. Comprehensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrated that FACL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation and model augmentation-based methods, achieving up to 3.8% improvement in recommendation accuracy. Moreover, fine-grained analyses confirm that FACL significantly alleviates the performance drop on low-frequency items and users, highlighting its robust intent-preserving ability and its superior applicability to real-world, long-tail recommendation scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17057v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can LLMs Clean Up Your Mess? A Survey of Application-Ready Data Preparation with LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17058</link><description>arXiv:2601.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data preparation aims to denoise raw datasets, uncover cross-dataset relationships, and extract valuable insights from them, which is essential for a wide range of data-centric applications. Driven by (i) rising demands for application-ready data (e.g., for analytics, visualization, decision-making), (ii) increasingly powerful LLM techniques, and (iii) the emergence of infrastructures that facilitate flexible agent construction (e.g., using Databricks Unity Catalog), LLM-enhanced methods are rapidly becoming a transformative and potentially dominant paradigm for data preparation.
  By investigating hundreds of recent literature works, this paper presents a systematic review of this evolving landscape, focusing on the use of LLM techniques to prepare data for diverse downstream tasks. First, we characterize the fundamental paradigm shift, from rule-based, model-specific pipelines to prompt-driven, context-aware, and agentic preparation workflows. Next, we introduce a task-centric taxonomy that organizes the field into three major tasks: data cleaning (e.g., standardization, error processing, imputation), data integration (e.g., entity matching, schema matching), and data enrichment (e.g., data annotation, profiling). For each task, we survey representative techniques, and highlight their respective strengths (e.g., improved generalization, semantic understanding) and limitations (e.g., the prohibitive cost of scaling LLMs, persistent hallucinations even in advanced agents, the mismatch between advanced methods and weak evaluation). Moreover, we analyze commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics (the empirical part). Finally, we discuss open research challenges and outline a forward-looking roadmap that emphasizes scalable LLM-data systems, principled designs for reliable agentic workflows, and robust evaluation protocols.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17058v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Initial results of the Digital Consciousness Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17060</link><description>arXiv:2601.17060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificially intelligent systems have become remarkably sophisticated. They hold conversations, write essays, and seem to understand context in ways that surprise even their creators. This raises a crucial question: Are we creating systems that are conscious? The Digital Consciousness Model (DCM) is a first attempt to assess the evidence for consciousness in AI systems in a systematic, probabilistic way. It provides a shared framework for comparing different AIs and biological organisms, and for tracking how the evidence changes over time as AI develops. Instead of adopting a single theory of consciousness, it incorporates a range of leading theories and perspectives - acknowledging that experts disagree fundamentally about what consciousness is and what conditions are necessary for it. This report describes the structure and initial results of the Digital Consciousness Model. Overall, we find that the evidence is against 2024 LLMs being conscious, but the evidence against 2024 LLMs being conscious is not decisive. The evidence against LLM consciousness is much weaker than the evidence against consciousness in simpler AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17060v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Computer Vision Pipeline for Iterative Bullet Hole Tracking in Rifle Zeroing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17062</link><description>arXiv:2601.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjusting rifle sights, a process commonly called "zeroing," requires shooters to identify and differentiate bullet holes from multiple firing iterations. Traditionally, this process demands physical inspection, introducing delays due to range safety protocols and increasing the risk of human error. We present an end-to-end computer vision system for automated bullet hole detection and iteration-based tracking directly from images taken at the firing line. Our approach combines YOLOv8 for accurate small-object detection with Intersection over Union (IoU) analysis to differentiate bullet holes across sequential images. To address the scarcity of labeled sequential data, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that removes rather than adds objects to simulate realistic firing sequences. Additionally, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline that standardizes target orientation using ORB-based perspective correction, improving model accuracy. Our system achieves 97.0% mean average precision on bullet hole detection and 88.8% accuracy in assigning bullet holes to the correct firing iteration. While designed for rifle zeroing, this framework offers broader applicability in domains requiring the temporal differentiation of visually similar objects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17062v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlashMoE: Reducing SSD I/O Bottlenecks via ML-Based Cache Replacement for Mixture-of-Experts Inference on Edge Devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17063</link><description>arXiv:2601.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained attention for efficiently scaling large language models. Although these models are extremely large, their sparse activation enables inference to be performed by accessing only a fraction of the model at a time. This property opens the possibility of on-device inference of MoE, which was previously considered infeasible for such large models. Consequently, various systems have been proposed to leverage this sparsity and enable efficient MoE inference for edge devices. However, previous MoE inference systems like Fiddler[8] or DAOP[13] rely on DRAM-based offloading and are not suitable for memory constrained on-device environments. As recent MoE models grow to hundreds of gigabytes, RAM-offloading solutions become impractical. To address this, we propose FlashMoE, a system that offloads inactive experts to SSD, enabling efficient MoE inference under limited RAM. FlashMoE incorporates a lightweight ML-based caching strategy that adaptively combines recency and frequency signals to maximize expert reuse, significantly reducing storage I/O. In addition, we built a user-grade desktop platform to demonstrate the practicality of FlashMoE. On this real hardware setup, FlashMoE improves cache hit rate by up to 51% over well-known offloading policies such as LRU and LFU, and achieves up to 2.6x speedup compared to existing MoE inference systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17063v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Between Search and Platform: ChatGPT Under the DSA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17064</link><description>arXiv:2601.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the applicability of the Digital Services Act (DSA) to ChatGPT, arguing that it should be classified as a hybrid of the two types of hosting services: online search engines and platforms. This requires classifying search engines as hosting services, which we show is appropriate under the DSA, thereby resolving an ambiguity in the legal framework. ChatGPT performs core search functions and stores user-provided inputs and custom GPTs, meeting the definition of hosting service. We compare ChatGPT's systemic risks with those of existing Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs) and Platforms (VLOPs), showing that it raises similarly serious concerns regarding illegal content, fundamental rights, democratic integrity, and public health. Now that ChatGPT has reached the 45 million EU user threshold, it should be subject to the most onerous DSA obligations, requiring the assessment and mitigation of risk emanating from both its online search engine- and platform-like characteristics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ThinkTank-ME: A Multi-Expert Framework for Middle East Event Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17065</link><description>arXiv:2601.17065v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated emergent physical coherence, positioning them as potential world models. However, a gap remains between contemporary "stateless" video architectures and classic state-centric world model theories. This work bridges this gap by proposing a novel taxonomy centered on two pillars: State Construction and Dynamics Modeling. We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation. Furthermore, we advocate for a transition in evaluation from visual fidelity to functional benchmarks, testing physical persistence and causal reasoning. We conclude by identifying two critical frontiers: enhancing persistence via data-driven memory and compressed fidelity, and advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration. By addressing these challenges, the field can evolve from generating visually plausible videos to building robust, general-purpose world simulators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Under Constrained Communications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17069</link><description>arXiv:2601.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) has been the dominant paradigm in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), but its reliance on global state information during training introduces scalability, robustness, and generalization bottlenecks. Moreover, in practical scenarios such as adding/dropping teammates or facing environment dynamics that differ from the training, CTDE methods can be brittle and costly to retrain, whereas distributed approaches allow agents to adapt using only local information and peer-to-peer communication. We present a distributed MARL framework that removes the need for centralized critics or global information. Firstly, we develop a novel Distributed Graph Attention Network (D-GAT) that performs global state inference through multi-hop communication, where agents integrate neighbor features via input-dependent attention weights in a fully distributed manner. Leveraging D-GAT, we develop the distributed graph-attention MAPPO (DG-MAPPO) -- a distributed MARL framework where agents optimize local policies and value functions using local observations, multi-hop communication, and shared/averaged rewards. Empirical evaluation on the StarCraftII Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent Mujoco demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines, achieving superior coordination across a wide range of cooperative tasks with both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams. Our distributed MARL framework provides a principled and scalable solution for robust collaboration, eliminating the need for centralized training or global observability.

While many studies examine AI in consumer marketing, less attention addresses AI's role in creating and selecting trademarks that are distinctive, recognizable, and meaningful to consumers. Traditional economic approaches to trademarks focus almost exclusively on consumer-based, demand-side considerations regarding search. However, these approaches are incomplete because they fail to account for substantial costs faced not just by consumers, but by trademark applicants as well. Given AI's rapidly increasing role in trademark search and similarity analysis, lawyers and scholars should understand its dramatic implications. This paper proposes that AI should interest anyone studying trademarks and their role in economic decision-making. We examine how machine learning techniques will transform the application and interpretation of foundational trademark doctrines, producing significant implications for the trademark ecosystem. We run empirical experiments regarding trademark search to assess the efficacy of various trademark search engines, many of which employ machine learning methods. Through comparative analysis, we evaluate how these AI-powered tools function in practice. In an age where artificial intelligence increasingly governs trademark selection, the classic division between consumers and trademark owners deserves an updated, supply-side framework. This insight has transformative potential for encouraging both innovation and efficiency in trademark law and practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17072v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Attention-Based Variational Framework for Joint and Individual Components Learning with Applications in Brain Network Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17073</link><description>arXiv:2601.17073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain organization is increasingly characterized through multiple imaging modalities, most notably structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC). Integrating these inherently distinct yet complementary data sources is essential for uncovering the cross-modal patterns that drive behavioral phenotypes. However, effective integration is hindered by the high dimensionality and non-linearity of connectome data, complex non-linear SC-FC coupling, and the challenge of disentangling shared information from modality-specific variations. To address these issues, we propose the Cross-Modal Joint-Individual Variational Network (CM-JIVNet), a unified probabilistic framework designed to learn factorized latent representations from paired SC-FC datasets. Our model utilizes a multi-head attention fusion module to capture non-linear cross-modal dependencies while isolating independent, modality-specific signals. Validated on Human Connectome Project Young Adult (HCP-YA) data, CM-JIVNet demonstrates superior performance in cross-modal reconstruction and behavioral trait prediction. By effectively disentangling joint and individual feature spaces, CM-JIVNet provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for large-scale multimodal brain analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17073v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PhysE-Inv: A Physics-Encoded Inverse Modeling approach for Arctic Snow Depth Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17074</link><description>arXiv:2601.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate estimation of Arctic snow depth ($h_s$) remains a critical time-varying inverse problem due to the extreme scarcity and noise inherent in associated sea ice parameters. Existing process-based and data-driven models are either highly sensitive to sparse data or lack the physical interpretability required for climate-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce PhysE-Inv, a novel framework that integrates a sophisticated sequential architecture, an LSTM Encoder-Decoder with Multi-head Attention and physics-guided contrastive learning, with physics-guided inference.Our core innovation lies in a surjective, physics-constrained inversion methodology. This methodology first leverages the hydrostatic balance forward model as a target-formulation proxy, enabling effective learning in the absence of direct $h_s$ ground truth; second, it uses reconstruction physics regularization over a latent space to dynamically discover hidden physical parameters from noisy, incomplete time-series input. Evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines, PhysE-Inv significantly improves prediction performance, reducing error by 20\% while demonstrating superior physical consistency and resilience to data sparsity compared to empirical methods. This approach pioneers a path for noise-tolerant, interpretable inverse modeling, with wide applicability in geospatial and cryospheric domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17074v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] E2PL: Effective and Efficient Prompt Learning for Incomplete Multi-view Multi-Label Class Incremental Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17076</link><description>arXiv:2601.17076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view multi-label classification (MvMLC) is indispensable for modern web applications aggregating information from diverse sources. However, real-world web-scale settings are rife with missing views and continuously emerging classes, which pose significant obstacles to robust learning. Prevailing methods are ill-equipped for this reality, as they either lack adaptability to new classes or incur exponential parameter growth when handling all possible missing-view patterns, severely limiting their scalability in web environments. To systematically address this gap, we formally introduce a novel task, termed \emph{incomplete multi-view multi-label class incremental learning} (IMvMLCIL), which requires models to simultaneously address heterogeneous missing views and dynamic class expansion. To tackle this task, we propose \textsf{E2PL}, an Effective and Efficient Prompt Learning framework for IMvMLCIL. \textsf{E2PL} unifies two novel prompt designs: \emph{task-tailored prompts} for class-incremental adaptation and \emph{missing-aware prompts} for the flexible integration of arbitrary view-missing scenarios. To fundamentally address the exponential parameter explosion inherent in missing-aware prompts, we devise an \emph{efficient prototype tensorization} module, which leverages atomic tensor decomposition to elegantly reduce the prompt parameter complexity from exponential to linear w.r.t. the number of views. We further incorporate a \emph{dynamic contrastive learning} strategy explicitly model the complex dependencies among diverse missing-view patterns, thus enhancing the model's robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that \textsf{E2PL} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: The problem of finding the general classification of geodetic graphs is still open. We believe that one of the obstacles to attain this goal is that geodetic graphs lack a structural description. In other words, their fundamental properties have not yet been established in terms of the description of the complete graphs, paths and cycles contained within them. The absence of this information makes their generation and enumeration (as inherent parts of their general classification) a difficult task. This paper examines the structural qualities of geodetic graphs using their so-called embedded even graphs. To this effect, the necessary and sufficient conditions for eliminating the nongeodecity of each pair of C-opposite vertices in an even cycle C have been formulated, while the bigeodecity of the embedded even graphs of a geodetic graph has been established. In a sense, this allows us to arrive at the conclusion that the basic building blocks of geodetic graphs are precisely this class of bigeodetic ones.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17077v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do VLMs Have a Moral Backbone?

Abstract: Despite substantial efforts toward improving the moral alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it remains unclear whether their ethical judgments are stable in realistic settings. This work studies moral robustness in VLMs, defined as the ability to preserve moral judgments under textual and visual perturbations that do not alter the underlying moral context. We systematically probe VLMs with a diverse set of model-agnostic multimodal perturbations and find that their moral stances are highly fragile, frequently flipping under simple manipulations. Our analysis reveals systematic vulnerabilities across perturbation types, moral domains, and model scales, including a sycophancy trade-off where stronger instruction-following models are more susceptible to persuasion. We further show that lightweight inference-time interventions can partially restore moral stability. These results demonstrate that moral alignment alone is insufficient and that moral robustness is a necessary criterion for the responsible deployment of VLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17082v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SonoEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Pronunciation Correction in LLM-Based TTS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17086</link><description>arXiv:2601.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems systematically mispronounce low-resource proper nouns, particularly non-English names, brands, and geographic locations, due to their underrepresentation in predominantly English training corpora. Existing solutions typically rely on expensive multilingual data collection, supervised finetuning, or manual phonetic annotation, which limits the deployment of TTS systems in linguistically diverse settings. We introduce SonoEdit, a model editing technique that surgically corrects pronunciation errors in pre-trained TTS models without retraining. Instead of costly finetuning or explicit phoneme injection, we propose a parsimonious alternative based on Null-Space Pronunciation Editing, which performs a single-shot parameter update to modify the pronunciation of specific words while provably preserving all other model behavior. We first adapt Acoustic Causal Tracing to identify the Transformer layers responsible for text-to-pronunciation mapping. We then apply Null-Space Constrained Editing to compute a closed-form weight update that corrects the target pronunciation while remaining mathematically orthogonal to the subspace governing general speech generation. This constrained update steers the model's acoustic output toward a desired pronunciation exemplar while guaranteeing zero first-order change on a preserved speech corpus.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17086v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lost in Simulation: LLM-Simulated Users are Unreliable Proxies for Human Users in Agentic Evaluations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17087</link><description>arXiv:2601.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic benchmarks increasingly rely on LLM-simulated users to scalably evaluate agent performance, yet the robustness, validity, and fairness of this approach remain unexamined. Through a user study with participants across the United States, India, Kenya, and Nigeria, we investigate whether LLM-simulated users serve as reliable proxies for real human users in evaluating agents on {\tau}-Bench retail tasks. We find that user simulation lacks robustness, with agent success rates varying up to 9 percentage points across different user LLMs. Furthermore, evaluations using simulated users exhibit systematic miscalibration, underestimating agent performance on challenging tasks and overestimating it on moderately difficult ones. African American Vernacular English (AAVE) speakers experience consistently worse success rates and calibration errors than Standard American English (SAE) speakers, with disparities compounding significantly with age. We also find simulated users to be a differentially effective proxy for different populations, performing worst for AAVE and Indian English speakers. Additionally, simulated users introduce conversational artifacts and surface different failure patterns than human users. These findings demonstrate that current evaluation practices risk misrepresenting agent capabilities across diverse user populations and may obscure real-world deployment challenges.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17087v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GlassesGB: Controllable 2D GAN-Based Eyewear Personalization for 3D Gaussian Blendshapes Head Avatars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17088</link><description>arXiv:2601.17088v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in visual question answering tasks. However, directly applying existing fine-tuning methods to remote sensing (RS) images often leads to issues such as overfitting on background noise or neglecting target details. This is primarily due to the large-scale variations, sparse target distributions, and complex regional semantic features inherent in RS images. These challenges limit the effectiveness of MLLMs in RS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy called Guided Region-Aware Sparse Prompting (GRASP). GRASP introduces spatially structured soft prompts associated with spatial blocks extracted from a frozen visual token grid. Through a question-guided sparse fusion mechanism, GRASP dynamically aggregates task-specific context into a compact global prompt, enabling the model to focus on relevant regions while filtering out background noise. Extensive experiments on multiple RSVQA benchmarks show that GRASP achieves competitive performance compared to existing fine-tuning and prompt-based methods while maintaining high parameter efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17089v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SFO: Learning PDE Operators via Spectral Filtering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17090</link><description>arXiv:2601.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern complex systems, yet neural operators often struggle to efficiently capture the long-range, nonlocal interactions inherent in their solution maps. We introduce Spectral Filtering Operator (SFO), a neural operator that parameterizes integral kernels using the Universal Spectral Basis (USB), a fixed, global orthonormal basis derived from the eigenmodes of the Hilbert matrix in spectral filtering theory. Motivated by our theoretical finding that the discrete Green's functions of shift-invariant PDE discretizations exhibit spatial Linear Dynamical System (LDS) structure, we prove that these kernels admit compact approximations in the USB. By learning only the spectral coefficients of rapidly decaying eigenvalues, SFO achieves a highly efficient representation. Across six benchmarks, including reaction-diffusion, fluid dynamics, and 3D electromagnetics, SFO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing error by up to 40% relative to strong baselines while using substantially fewer parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17090v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CUROCKET: Optimizing ROCKET for GPU</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17091</link><description>arXiv:2601.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) is a feature extraction algorithm created for Time Series Classification (TSC), published in 2019. It applies convolution with randomly generated kernels on a time series, producing features that can be used to train a linear classifier or regressor like Ridge. At the time of publication, ROCKET was on par with the best state-of-the-art algorithms for TSC in terms of accuracy while being significantly less computationally expensive, making ROCKET a compelling algorithm for TSC. This also led to several subsequent versions, further improving accuracy and computational efficiency. The currently available ROCKET implementations are mostly bound to execution on CPU. However, convolution is a task that can be highly parallelized and is therefore suited to be executed on GPU, which speeds up the computation significantly. A key difficulty arises from the inhomogeneous kernels ROCKET uses, making standard methods for applying convolution on GPU inefficient. In this work, we propose an algorithm that is able to efficiently perform ROCKET on GPU and achieves up to 11 times higher computational efficiency per watt than ROCKET on CPU.

Abstract: Comparing neural network representations is essential for understanding and validating models in scientific applications. Existing methods, however, often provide a limited view. We propose the Triangle of Similarity, a framework that combines three complementary perspectives: static representational similarity (CKA/Procrustes), functional similarity (Linear Mode Connectivity or Predictive Similarity), and sparsity similarity (robustness under pruning). Analyzing a range of CNNs, Vision Transformers, and Vision-Language Models using both in-distribution (ImageNetV2) and out-of-distribution (CIFAR-10) testbeds, our initial findings suggest that: (1) architectural family is a primary determinant of representational similarity, forming distinct clusters; (2) CKA self-similarity and task accuracy are strongly correlated during pruning, though accuracy often degrades more sharply; and (3) for some model pairs, pruning appears to regularize representations, exposing a shared computational core. This framework offers a more holistic approach for assessing whether models have converged on similar internal mechanisms, providing a useful tool for model selection and analysis in scientific research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17093v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Boltzmann-GPT: Bridging Energy-Based World Models and Language Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17094</link><description>arXiv:2601.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent text, yet whether they truly understand the world or merely produce plausible language about it remains contested. We propose an architectural principle, the mouth is not the brain, that explicitly separates world models from language models. Our architecture comprises three components: a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) that captures domain structure as an energy-based world model, an adapter that projects latent belief states into embedding space, and a frozen GPT-2 that provides linguistic competence without domain knowledge. We instantiate this framework in the consumer review domain using Amazon smartphone reviews. Experiments demonstrate that (1) conditioning through the world model yields significantly higher sentiment correlation, lower perplexity, and greater semantic similarity compared to prompt-based generation alone; (2) the DBM's energy function distinguishes coherent from incoherent market configurations, assigning higher energy to implausible brand-price combinations; and (3) interventions on specific attributes propagate causally to generated text with intervened outputs exhibiting distributions statistically consistent with naturally occurring samples sharing the target configuration. These findings suggest that even small-scale language models can achieve consistent, controllable generation when connected to an appropriate world model, providing empirical support for separating linguistic competence from world understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17094v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LoD Sketch Extraction from Architectural Models Using Generative AI: Dataset Construction for Multi-Level Architectural Design Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17095</link><description>arXiv:2601.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For architectural design, representation across multiple Levels of Details (LoD) is essential for achieving a smooth transition from conceptual massing to detailed modeling. However, traditional LoD modeling processes rely on manual operations that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to geometric inconsistencies. While the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new possibilities for generating multi-level architectural models from sketch inputs, its application remains limited by the lack of high-quality paired LoD training data. To address this issue, we propose an automatic LoD sketch extraction framework using generative AI models, which progressively simplifies high-detail architectural models to automatically generate geometrically consistent and hierarchically coherent multi-LoD representations. The proposed framework integrates computer vision techniques with generative AI methods to establish a progressive extraction pipeline that transitions from detailed representations to volumetric abstractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method maintains strong geometric consistency across LoD levels, achieving SSIM values of 0.7319 and 0.7532 for the transitions from LoD3 to LoD2 and from LoD2 to LoD1, respectively, with corresponding normalized Hausdorff distances of 25.1% and 61.0% of the image diagonal, reflecting controlled geometric deviation during abstraction. These results verify that the proposed framework effectively preserves global structure while achieving progressive semantic simplification across different LoD levels, providing reliable data and technical support for AI-driven multi-level architectural generation and hierarchical modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17095v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Instrumental and Substitutive Paradigms: Introducing Machine Culture as an Emergent Phenomenon in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17096</link><description>arXiv:2601.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent scholarship typically characterizes Large Language Models (LLMs) through either an \textit{Instrumental Paradigm} (viewing models as reflections of their developers' culture) or a \textit{Substitutive Paradigm} (viewing models as bilingual proxies that switch cultural frames based on language). This study challenges these anthropomorphic frameworks by proposing \textbf{Machine Culture} as an emergent, distinct phenomenon. We employed a 2 (Model Origin: US vs. China) $\times$ 2 (Prompt Language: English vs. Chinese) factorial design across eight multimodal tasks, uniquely incorporating image generation and interpretation to extend analysis beyond textual boundaries. Results revealed inconsistencies with both dominant paradigms: Model origin did not predict cultural alignment, with US models frequently exhibiting ``holistic'' traits typically associated with East Asian data. Similarly, prompt language did not trigger stable cultural frame-switching; instead, we observed \textbf{Cultural Reversal}, where English prompts paradoxically elicited higher contextual attention than Chinese prompts. Crucially, we identified a novel phenomenon termed \textbf{Service Persona Camouflage}: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) collapsed cultural variance in affective tasks into a hyper-positive, zero-variance ``helpful assistant'' persona. We conclude that LLMs do not simulate human culture but exhibit an emergent Machine Culture -- a probabilistic phenomenon shaped by \textit{superposition} in high-dimensional space and \textit{mode collapse} from safety alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17096v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sink or SWIM: Tackling Real-Time ASR at Scale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17097</link><description>arXiv:2601.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time automatic speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into interactive applications, from voice assistants to live transcription services. However, scaling these systems to support multiple concurrent clients while maintaining low latency and high accuracy remains a major challenge. In this work, we present SWIM, a novel real-time ASR system built on top of OpenAI's Whisper model that enables true model-level parallelization for scalable, multilingual transcription. SWIM supports multiple concurrent audio streams without modifying the underlying model. It introduces a buffer merging strategy that maintains transcription fidelity while ensuring efficient resource usage. We evaluate SWIM in multi-client settings -- scaling up to 20 concurrent users -- and show that it delivers accurate real-time transcriptions in English, Italian, and Spanish, while maintaining low latency and high throughput. While Whisper-Streaming achieves a word error rate of approximately 8.2% with an average delay of approximately 3.4 s in a single-client, English-only setting, SWIM extends this capability to multilingual, multi-client environments. It maintains comparable accuracy with significantly lower delay -- around 2.4 s with 5 clients -- and continues to scale effectively up to 20 concurrent clients without degrading transcription quality and increasing overall throughput. Our approach advances scalable ASR by improving robustness and efficiency in dynamic, multi-user environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17097v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Performance uncertainty in medical image analysis: a large-scale investigation of confidence intervals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17103</link><description>arXiv:2601.17103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance uncertainty quantification is essential for reliable validation and eventual clinical translation of medical imaging artificial intelligence (AI). Confidence intervals (CIs) play a central role in this process by indicating how precise a reported performance estimate is. Yet, due to the limited amount of work examining CI behavior in medical imaging, the community remains largely unaware of how many diverse CI methods exist and how they behave in specific settings. The purpose of this study is to close this gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis across a total of 24 segmentation and classification tasks, using 19 trained models per task group, a broad spectrum of commonly used performance metrics, multiple aggregation strategies, and several widely adopted CI methods. Reliability (coverage) and precision (width) of each CI method were estimated across all settings to characterize their dependence on study characteristics. Our analysis revealed five principal findings: 1) the sample size required for reliable CIs varies from a few dozens to several thousands of cases depending on study parameters; 2) CI behavior is strongly affected by the choice of performance metric; 3) aggregation strategy substantially influences the reliability of CIs, e.g. they require more observations for macro than for micro; 4) the machine learning problem (segmentation versus classification) modulates these effects; 5) different CI methods are not equally reliable and precise depending on the use case. These results form key components for the development of future guidelines on reporting performance uncertainty in medical imaging AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StealthMark: Harmless and Stealthy Ownership Verification for Medical Segmentation via Uncertainty-Guided Backdoors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17107</link><description>arXiv:2601.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Annotating medical data for training AI models is often costly and limited due to the shortage of specialists with relevant clinical expertise. This challenge is further compounded by privacy and ethical concerns associated with sensitive patient information. As a result, well-trained medical segmentation models on private datasets constitute valuable intellectual property requiring robust protection mechanisms. Existing model protection techniques primarily focus on classification and generative tasks, while segmentation models-crucial to medical image analysis-remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel, stealthy, and harmless method, StealthMark, for verifying the ownership of medical segmentation models under black-box conditions. Our approach subtly modulates model uncertainty without altering the final segmentation outputs, thereby preserving the model's performance. To enable ownership verification, we incorporate model-agnostic explanation methods, e.g. LIME, to extract feature attributions from the model outputs. Under specific triggering conditions, these explanations reveal a distinct and verifiable watermark. We further design the watermark as a QR code to facilitate robust and recognizable ownership claims. We conducted extensive experiments across four medical imaging datasets and five mainstream segmentation models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and harmlessness of our method on the original model's segmentation performance. For example, when applied to the SAM model, StealthMark consistently achieved ASR above 95% across various datasets while maintaining less than a 1% drop in Dice and AUC scores, significantly outperforming backdoor-based watermarking methods and highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Mamba-assisted neural network framework incorporating self-attention mechanism to achieve improved channel estimation with low complexity for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms, particularly for configurations with a large number of subcarriers. With the integration of customized Mamba architecture, the proposed framework handles large-scale subcarrier channel estimation efficiently while capturing long-distance dependencies among these subcarriers effectively. Unlike conventional Mamba structure, this paper implements a bidirectional selective scan to improve channel estimation performance, because channel gains at different subcarriers are non-causal. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibits relatively lower space complexity than transformer-based neural networks. Simulation results tested on the 3GPP TS 36.101 channel demonstrate that compared to other baseline neural network solutions, the proposed method achieves improved channel estimation performance with a reduced number of tunable parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17108v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Authority Signals in AI Cited Health Sources: A Framework for Evaluating Source Credibility in ChatGPT Responses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17109</link><description>arXiv:2601.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health information seeking has fundamentally changed since the onset of Large Language Models (LLM), with nearly one third of ChatGPT's 800 million users asking health questions weekly. Understanding the sources of those AI generated responses is vital, as health organizations and providers are also investing in digital strategies to organically improve their ranking, reach and visibility in LLM systems like ChatGPT. As AI search optimization strategies are gaining maturity, this study introduces an Authority Signals Framework, organized in four domains that reflect key components to health information seeking, starting with "Who wrote it?" (Author Credentials), followed by "Who published it?" (Institutional Affiliation), "How was it vetted?" (Quality Assurance), and "How does AI find it?" (Digital Authority). This descriptive cross-sectional study randomly selected 100 questions from HealthSearchQA which contains 3,173 consumer health questions curated by Google Research from publicly available search engine suggestions. Those questions were entered into ChatGPT 5.2 Pro to record and code the cited sources through the lens of the Authority Signals Framework's four domains. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all cited sources (n=615), and cross tabulations were conducted to examine distinction among organization types. Over 75% of the sources cited in ChatGPT's health generated responses were from established institutional sources, such as Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Wikipedia, National Health Service, PubMed with the remaining citations sourced from alternative health information sources that lacked established institutional backing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17109v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Forecasting Energy Consumption using Recurrent Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17110</link><description>arXiv:2601.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate short-term energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient power grid management, resource allocation, and market stability. Traditional time-series models often fail to capture the complex, non-linear dependencies and external factors affecting energy demand. In this study, we propose a forecasting approach based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their advanced variant, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our methodology integrates historical energy consumption data with external variables, including temperature, humidity, and time-based features. The LSTM model is trained and evaluated on a publicly available dataset, and its performance is compared against a conventional feed-forward neural network baseline. Experimental results show that the LSTM model substantially outperforms the baseline, achieving lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning models in providing reliable and precise short-term energy forecasts for real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17110v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism: Load Balancing An Imbalanced Mixture-of-Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17111</link><description>arXiv:2601.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are typically pre-trained with explicit load-balancing constraints to ensure statistically balanced expert routing. Despite this, we observe that even well-trained MoE models exhibit significantly imbalanced routing. This behavior is arguably natural-and even desirable - as imbalanced routing allows models to concentrate domain-specific knowledge within a subset of experts. Expert parallelism (EP) is designed to scale MoE models by distributing experts across multiple devices, but with a less-discussed assumption of balanced routing. Under extreme imbalance, EP can funnel a disproportionate number of tokens to a small number of experts, leading to compute- and memory-bound failures on overloaded devices during post-training or inference, where explicit load balancing is often inapplicable. We propose Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism (LLEP), a novel EP algorithm that dynamically reroutes excess tokens and associated expert parameters from overloaded devices to underutilized ones. This ensures that all devices complete their workloads within the minimum collective latency while respecting memory constraints. Across different model scales, LLEP achieves up to 5x speedup and 4x reduction in peak memory usage compared to standard EP. This enables faster and higher-throughput post-training and inference, with ~1.9x faster for gpt-oss-120b. We support our method with extensive theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations, including ablation studies. These results illuminate key trade-offs and enable a principled framework for hardware-specific hyper-parameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17111v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Low-Rank Tensor Approximation of Weights in Large Language Models via Cosine Lanczos Bidiagonalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17112</link><description>arXiv:2601.17112v1 Announce Type: new

This enables computationally efficient compression that exploits multidimensional correlations beyond traditional SVD methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Acoustic Field Video for Multimodal Scene Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17123</link><description>arXiv:2601.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and explore a new multimodal input representation for vision-language models: acoustic field video. Unlike conventional video (RGB with stereo/mono audio), our video stream provides a spatially grounded visualization of sound intensity across a scene, offering a new and powerful dimension of perceptual understanding. Our real-time pipeline uses low-cost beamforming microphone arrays that are already common in smart speakers and increasingly present in robotics and XR headsets, yet this sensing capability remains unutilized for scene understanding. To assess the value of spatial acoustic information, we constructed an evaluation set of 402 question-answer scenes, comparing a state-of-the-art VLM given conventional video with and without paired acoustic field video. Results show a clear and consistent improvement when incorporating spatial acoustic data; the VLM we test improves from 38.3% correct to 67.4%. Our findings highlight that many everyday scene understanding tasks remain underconstrained when relying solely on visual and audio input, and that acoustic field data provides a promising and practical direction for multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: The field of image generation is currently bifurcated into autoregressive (AR) models operating on discrete tokens and diffusion models utilizing continuous latents. This divide, rooted in the distinction between VQ-VAEs and VAEs, hinders unified modeling and fair benchmarking. Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) offers a theoretical bridge, yet vanilla FSQ suffers from a critical flaw: its equal-interval quantization can cause activation collapse. This mismatch forces a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and information efficiency. In this work, we resolve this dilemma by simply replacing the activation function in original FSQ with a distribution-matching mapping to enforce a uniform prior. Termed iFSQ, this simple strategy requires just one line of code yet mathematically guarantees both optimal bin utilization and reconstruction precision. Leveraging iFSQ as a controlled benchmark, we uncover two key insights: (1) The optimal equilibrium between discrete and continuous representations lies at approximately 4 bits per dimension. (2) Under identical reconstruction constraints, AR models exhibit rapid initial convergence, whereas diffusion models achieve a superior performance ceiling, suggesting that strict sequential ordering may limit the upper bounds of generation quality. Finally, we extend our analysis by adapting Representation Alignment (REPA) to AR models, yielding LlamaGen-REPA.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the standard tool for encoding data and their complex relationships into continuous representations, improving prediction accuracy in several machine learning tasks like node classification and link prediction. However, their use in sensitive applications has raised concerns about the potential leakage of training data. Research on privacy leakage in GNNs has largely been shaped by findings from non-graph domains, such as images and tabular data. We emphasize the need of graph specific analysis and investigate the impact of graph structure on node level membership inference. We formalize MI over node-neighbourhood tuples and investigate two important dimensions: (i) training graph construction and (ii) inference-time edge access. Empirically, snowball's coverage bias often harms generalisation relative to random sampling, while enabling inter-train-test edges at inference improves test accuracy, shrinks the train-test gap, and yields the lowest membership advantage across most of the models and datasets. We further show that the generalisation gap empirically measured as the performance difference between the train and test nodes is an incomplete proxy for MI risk: access to edges dominates-MI can rise or fall independent of gap changes. Finally, we examine the auditability of differentially private GNNs, adapting the definition of statistical exchangeability of train-test data points for graph based models. We show that for node level tasks the inductive splits (random or snowball sampled) break exchangeability, limiting the applicability of standard bounds for membership advantage of differential private models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17130v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Emotion to Expression: Theoretical Foundations and Resources for Fear Speech</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17132</link><description>arXiv:2601.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few forces rival fear in their ability to mobilize societies, distort communication, and reshape collective behavior. In computational linguistics, fear is primarily studied as an emotion, but not as a distinct form of speech. Fear speech content is widespread and growing, and often outperforms hate-speech content in reach and engagement because it appears "civiler" and evades moderation. Yet the computational study of fear speech remains fragmented and under-resourced. This can be understood by recognizing that fear speech is a phenomenon shaped by contributions from multiple disciplines. In this paper, we bridge cross-disciplinary perspectives by comparing theories of fear from Psychology, Political science, Communication science, and Linguistics. Building on this, we review existing definitions. We follow up with a survey of datasets from related research areas and propose a taxonomy that consolidates different dimensions of fear for studying fear speech. By reviewing current datasets and defining core concepts, our work offers both theoretical and practical guidance for creating datasets and advancing fear speech research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Collaborate: An Orchestrated-Decentralized Framework for Peer-to-Peer LLM Federation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17133</link><description>arXiv:2601.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized domains is constrained by a fundamental challenge: the need for diverse, cross-organizational data conflicts with the principles of data privacy and sovereignty. While Federated Learning (FL) provides a framework for collaboration without raw data exchange, its classic centralized form introduces a single point of failure and remains vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Decentralized FL (DFL) mitigates this risk by removing the central aggregator but typically relies on inefficient, random peer-to-peer (P2P) pairings, forming a collaboration graph that is blind to agent heterogeneity and risks negative transfer. This paper introduces KNEXA-FL, a novel framework for orchestrated decentralization that resolves this trade-off. KNEXA-FL employs a non-aggregating Central Profiler/Matchmaker (CPM) that formulates P2P collaboration as a contextual bandit problem, using a LinUCB algorithm on abstract agent profiles to learn an optimal matchmaking policy. It orchestrates direct knowledge exchange between heterogeneous, PEFT-based LLM agents via secure distillation, without ever accessing the models themselves. Our comprehensive experiments on a challenging code generation task show that KNEXA-FL yields substantial gains, improving Pass@1 by approx. 50% relative to random P2P collaboration. Critically, our orchestrated approach demonstrates stable convergence, in stark contrast to a powerful centralized distillation baseline which suffers from catastrophic performance collapse. Our work establishes adaptive, learning-based orchestration as a foundational principle for building robust and effective decentralized AI ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17133v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deconstructing Taste: Toward a Human-Centered AI Framework for Modeling Consumer Aesthetic Perceptions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17134</link><description>arXiv:2601.17134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling consumers' stylistic taste such as "sporty" is crucial for creating designs that truly connect with target audiences. However, capturing taste during the design process remains challenging because taste is abstract and subjective, and preference data alone provides limited guidance for concrete design decisions. This paper proposes an integrated human-centered computational framework that links subjective evaluations (e.g., perceived luxury of car wheels) with domain-specific features (e.g., spoke configuration) and computer vision-based measures (e.g., texture). By jointly modeling human-derived (consumer and designer) and machine-extracted features, our framework advances aesthetic assessment by explicitly linking model outcomes to interpretable design features. In particular, it demonstrates how perceptual features, domain-specific design patterns, and consumers' own interpretations of style contribute to aesthetic evaluations. This framework will enable product teams to better understand, communicate, and critique aesthetic decisions, supporting improved anticipation of consumer taste and more informed exploration of design alternatives at design time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17134v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ConceptACT: Episode-Level Concepts for Sample-Efficient Robotic Imitation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17135</link><description>arXiv:2601.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning enables robots to acquire complex manipulation skills from human demonstrations, but current methods rely solely on low-level sensorimotor data while ignoring the rich semantic knowledge humans naturally possess about tasks. We present ConceptACT, an extension of Action Chunking with Transformers that leverages episode-level semantic concept annotations during training to improve learning efficiency. Unlike language-conditioned approaches that require semantic input at deployment, ConceptACT uses human-provided concepts (object properties, spatial relationships, task constraints) exclusively during demonstration collection, adding minimal annotation burden. We integrate concepts using a modified transformer architecture in which the final encoder layer implements concept-aware cross-attention, supervised to align with human annotations. Through experiments on two robotic manipulation tasks with logical constraints, we demonstrate that ConceptACT converges faster and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard ACT. Crucially, we show that architectural integration through attention mechanisms significantly outperforms naive auxiliary prediction losses or language-conditioned models. These results demonstrate that properly integrated semantic supervision provides powerful inductive biases for more efficient robot learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17135v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Communication-Avoiding Linear Algebraic Kernel K-Means on GPUs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17136</link><description>arXiv:2601.17136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is an important tool in data analysis, with K-means being popular for its simplicity and versatility. However, it cannot handle non-linearly separable clusters. Kernel K-means addresses this limitation but requires a large kernel matrix, making it computationally and memory intensive. Prior work has accelerated Kernel K-means by formulating it using sparse linear algebra primitives and implementing it on a single GPU. However, that approach cannot run on datasets with more than approximately 80,000 samples due to limited GPU memory.
  In this work, we address this issue by presenting a suite of distributed-memory parallel algorithms for large-scale Kernel K-means clustering on multi-GPU systems. Our approach maps the most computationally expensive components of Kernel K-means onto communication-efficient distributed linear algebra primitives uniquely tailored for Kernel K-means, enabling highly scalable implementations that efficiently cluster million-scale datasets. Central to our work is the design of partitioning schemes that enable communication-efficient composition of the linear algebra primitives that appear in Kernel K-means.
  Our 1.5D algorithm consistently achieves the highest performance, enabling Kernel K-means to scale to data one to two orders of magnitude larger than previously practical. On 256 GPUs, it achieves a geometric mean weak scaling efficiency of $79.7\%$ and a geometric mean strong scaling speedup of $4.2\times$. Compared to our 1D algorithm, the 1.5D approach achieves up to a $3.6\times$ speedup on 256 GPUs and reduces clustering time from over an hour to under two seconds relative to a single-GPU sliding window implementation. Our results show that distributed algorithms designed with application-specific linear algebraic formulations can achieve substantial performance improvement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17136v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bowling Online: Accounting for Civil Society Reshaped into Streamlined Photons within a Fiber Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17139</link><description>arXiv:2601.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Civil society has been deemed by various scholars, such as Robert D. Putnam, to be a predictor and a cornerstone of a robust and consolidated democracy (Putnam et al., 1993). Putnam highlights in his book Bowling Alone (2000) that American civil society has become weaker: people organize less, and literally, they bowl alone. But what if there is yet another aspect to Putnam's story that has not been fully accounted for, namely the rise of Digital Civil Society (DCS)? Perhaps people in the third decade of the 21st century bowl online. They still organize, mobilize, and care for their civil liberties and democratic institutions; however, the public sphere in which this takes place has shifted online to cyberspace (Bernholz et al., 2013) or to what still needs to be conceptualized, the digital public sphere (DPS), which this article attempts to measure and demarcate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17139v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring EEG-driven brain-heart coupling across sleep stages in individuals with sleep disorders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17149</link><description>arXiv:2601.17149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between the brain and heart during sleep are responsible for regulating autonomic function. While brain-heart coupling has been studied in healthy populations, the relationships between neural and cardiac activity across sleep stages in the presence of sleep disorders are not clear. This study examines the influence of brain-driven cardiac activity across sleep stages for individuals with sleep disorders. Overnight recordings of C3 and C4 electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from 146 individuals were preprocessed and analyzed in the frequency domain through a linear mixed-effect model. Our results show that parasympathetic activity is sensitive to changes in delta and beta powers during later stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as both band powers exhibited strong negative effects on high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) power. These findings show that neural activity can drive vagal tone across sleep stages, suggesting that treatments on key EEG bands during NREM and REM stages may help restore regular cardiac behaviour.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17149v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling medical imaging report generation with multimodal reinforcement learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17151</link><description>arXiv:2601.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning with natural-language text, but they still exhibit major competency gaps in multimodal understanding and reasoning especially in high-value verticals such as biomedicine. Medical imaging report generation is a prominent example. Supervised fine-tuning can substantially improve performance, but they are prone to overfitting to superficial boilerplate patterns. In this paper, we introduce Universal Report Generation (UniRG) as a general framework for medical imaging report generation. By leveraging reinforcement learning as a unifying mechanism to directly optimize for evaluation metrics designed for end applications, UniRG can significantly improve upon supervised fine-tuning and attain durable generalization across diverse institutions and clinical practices. We trained UniRG-CXR on publicly available chest X-ray (CXR) data and conducted a thorough evaluation in CXR report generation with rigorous evaluation scenarios. On the authoritative ReXrank benchmark, UniRG-CXR sets new overall SOTA, outperforming prior state of the art by a wide margin.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Role Assignment for Multi-Agent Debate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17152</link><description>arXiv:2601.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) and vision-language model (VLM) debate systems employ specialized roles for complex problem-solving, yet model specializations are not leveraged to decide which model should fill which role. We propose dynamic role assignment, a framework that runs a Meta-Debate to select suitable agents before the actual debate. The meta-debate has two stages: (1) proposal, where candidates provide role-tailored arguments, and (2) peer review, where proposals are scored with data and role-specific criteria to choose the best agent for each position. We evaluate our method on LLM problem solving benchmarks. Applied on top of existing debate systems, our approach consistently outperforms uniform assignments (filling all roles with the same model) by up to 74.8% and random assignments (assigning models to roles without considering their suitability) by up to 29.7%, depending on the task and the specific assignment. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-agent system design, shifting from static agent deployment to dynamic and capability-aware selection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17152v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Set-Based Reachability for Low-Thrust Spacecraft in Two-Body and Cislunar Dynamical Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17155</link><description>arXiv:2601.17155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of zonotope-based reachability analysis to low-thrust spacecraft in both two-body and cislunar environments. Reachable sets are generated under two-body and circular restricted three-body (CR3BP) dynamics using set-based methods that approximate nonlinear systems via Taylor expansions. A state-dependent coefficient (SDC) parameterization is also explored to represent nonlinear dynamics in a pseudo-linear form, enabling efficient matrix based propagation of reachable sets. Applications include Earth-Mars transfer and cislunar scenarios such as L1 and L2 Halo orbits and Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs). The resulting reachable sets are used for safe trajectory generation and tracking, with comparisons drawn between model predictive control (MPC) and LQR-based station-keeping. The proposed approach provides a scalable framework for analyzing spacecraft behavior under complex dynamics and control constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17155v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpretability of the Intent Detection Problem: A New Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17156</link><description>arXiv:2601.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intent detection, a fundamental text classification task, aims to identify and label the semantics of user queries, playing a vital role in numerous business applications. Despite the dominance of deep learning techniques in this field, the internal mechanisms enabling Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to solve intent detection tasks are poorly understood. In this work, we apply dynamical systems theory to analyze how RNN architectures address this problem, using both the balanced SNIPS and the imbalanced ATIS datasets. By interpreting sentences as trajectories in the hidden state space, we first show that on the balanced SNIPS dataset, the network learns an ideal solution: the state space, constrained to a low-dimensional manifold, is partitioned into distinct clusters corresponding to each intent. The application of this framework to the imbalanced ATIS dataset then reveals how this ideal geometric solution is distorted by class imbalance, causing the clusters for low-frequency intents to degrade. Our framework decouples geometric separation from readout alignment, providing a novel, mechanistic explanation for real world performance disparities. These findings provide new insights into RNN dynamics, offering a geometric interpretation of how dataset properties directly shape a network's computational solution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autonomous Mars Rover Module for Soil Sampling and Life Component Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17158</link><description>arXiv:2601.17158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial life has long been a primary focus of scientific exploration, driven by rapid advancements in technology and our understanding of the universe. The discovery of water on Mars has sparked significant interest, raising the question of whether life could exist on the planet. This study proposes a novel approach to simulate and illustrate the detection of life using a proof-of-life module integrated into a Mars rover. The module is an autonomous system capable of traveling to designated regions, excavating soil, collecting samples, and performing biochemical testing onboard the rover itself. The project is inherently multidisciplinary, integrating mechanical systems such as a drill mechanism and a vacuum system, alongside biochemical analysis for soil testing. The module is capable of successfully detecting the presence or absence of living components of life from the collected soil particles. This proof-of-life module serves as a proof-of-concept for autonomous life detection in extraterrestrial environments and lays the foundation for future exploration missions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17158v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpreting Agentic Systems: Beyond Model Explanations to System-Level Accountability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17168</link><description>arXiv:2601.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic systems have transformed how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to create autonomous systems with goal-directed behaviors, consisting of multi-step planning and the ability to interact with different environments. These systems differ fundamentally from traditional machine learning models, both in architecture and deployment, introducing unique AI safety challenges, including goal misalignment, compounding decision errors, and coordination risks among interacting agents, that necessitate embedding interpretability and explainability by design to ensure traceability and accountability across their autonomous behaviors. Current interpretability techniques, developed primarily for static models, show limitations when applied to agentic systems. The temporal dynamics, compounding decisions, and context-dependent behaviors of agentic systems demand new analytical approaches. This paper assesses the suitability and limitations of existing interpretability methods in the context of agentic systems, identifying gaps in their capacity to provide meaningful insight into agent decision-making. We propose future directions for developing interpretability techniques specifically designed for agentic systems, pinpointing where interpretability is required to embed oversight mechanisms across the agent lifecycle from goal formation, through environmental interaction, to outcome evaluation. These advances are essential to ensure the safe and accountable deployment of agentic AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17168v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who Gets Which Message?

This paper presents the first systematic analysis of how LLMs behave when tasked with demographic-conditioned targeted messaging. We introduce a controlled evaluation framework using three leading models -- GPT-4o, Llama-3.3, and Mistral-Large 2.1 -- across two generation settings: Standalone Generation, which isolates intrinsic demographic effects, and Context-Rich Generation, which incorporates thematic and regional context to emulate realistic targeting. We evaluate generated messages along three dimensions: lexical content, language style, and persuasive framing. We instantiate this framework on climate communication and find consistent age- and gender-based asymmetries across models: male- and youth-targeted messages emphasize agency, innovation, and assertiveness, while female- and senior-targeted messages stress warmth, care, and tradition. Contextual prompts systematically amplify these disparities, with persuasion scores significantly higher for messages tailored to younger or male audiences. Our findings demonstrate how demographic stereotypes can surface and intensify in LLM-generated targeted communication, underscoring the need for bias-aware generation pipelines and transparent auditing frameworks that explicitly account for demographic conditioning in socially sensitive applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17172v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Factual QA: Mentorship-Oriented Question Answering over Long-Form Multilingual Content</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17173</link><description>arXiv:2601.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question answering systems are typically evaluated on factual correctness, yet many real-world applications-such as education and career guidance-require mentorship: responses that provide reflection and guidance. Existing QA benchmarks rarely capture this distinction, particularly in multilingual and long-form settings. We introduce MentorQA, the first multilingual dataset and evaluation framework for mentorship-focused question answering from long-form videos, comprising nearly 9,000 QA pairs from 180 hours of content across four languages. We define mentorship-focused evaluation dimensions that go beyond factual accuracy, capturing clarity, alignment, and learning value. Using MentorQA, we compare Single-Agent, Dual-Agent, RAG, and Multi-Agent QA architectures under controlled conditions. Multi-Agent pipelines consistently produce higher-quality mentorship responses, with especially strong gains for complex topics and lower-resource languages. We further analyze the reliability of automated LLM-based evaluation, observing substantial variation in alignment with human judgments. Overall, this work establishes mentorship-focused QA as a distinct research problem and provides a multilingual benchmark for studying agentic architectures and evaluation design in educational AI. The dataset and evaluation framework are released at https://github.com/AIM-SCU/MentorQA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17173v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TrojanGYM: A Detector-in-the-Loop LLM for Adaptive RTL Hardware Trojan Insertion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17178</link><description>arXiv:2601.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware Trojans (HTs) remain a critical threat because learning-based detectors often overfit to narrow trigger/payload patterns and small, stylized benchmarks. We introduce TrojanGYM, an agentic, LLM-driven framework that automatically curates HT insertions to expose detector blind spots while preserving design correctness. Given high-level HT specifications, a suite of cooperating LLM agents (instantiated with GPT-4, LLaMA-3.3-70B, and Gemini-2.5Pro) proposes and refines RTL modifications that realize diverse triggers and payloads without impacting normal functionality. TrojanGYM implements a feedback-driven benchmark generation loop co-designed with HT detectors, in which constraint-aware syntactic checking and GNN-based HT detectors provide feedback that iteratively refines HT specifications and insertion strategies to better surface detector blind spots. We further propose Robust-GNN4TJ, a new implementation of the GNN4TJ with improved graph extraction, training robustness, and prediction reliability, especially on LLM-generated HT designs. On the most challenging TrojanGYM-generated benchmarks, Robust-GNN4TJ raises HT detection rates from 0% to 60% relative to a prior GNN-based detector. We instantiate TrojanGYM on SRAM, AES-128, and UART designs at RTL level, and show that it systematically produces diverse, functionally correct HTs that reach up to 83.33% evasion rates against modern GNN-based detectors, revealing robustness gaps that are not apparent when these detectors are evaluated solely on existing TrustHub-style benchmarks. Post peer-review, we will release all codes and artifacts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17178v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conservative &amp; Aggressive NaNs Accelerate U-Nets for Neuroimaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17180</link><description>arXiv:2601.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for neuroimaging increasingly rely on large architectures, making efficiency a persistent concern despite advances in hardware. Through an analysis of numerical uncertainty of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we observe that many operations are applied to values dominated by numerical noise and have negligible influence on model outputs. In some models, up to two-thirds of convolution operations appear redundant. We introduce Conservative &amp; Aggressive NaNs, two novel variants of max pooling and unpooling that identify numerically unstable voxels and replace them with NaNs, allowing subsequent layers to skip computations on irrelevant data. Both methods are implemented within PyTorch and require no architectural changes. We evaluate these approaches on four CNN models spanning neuroimaging and image classification tasks. For inputs containing at least 50% NaNs, we observe consistent runtime improvements; for data with more than two-thirds NaNs )common in several neuroimaging settings) we achieve an average inference speedup of 1.67x. Conservative NaNs reduces convolution operations by an average of 30% across models and datasets, with no measurable performance degradation, and can skip up to 64.64% of convolutions in specific layers. Aggressive NaNs can skip up to 69.30% of convolutions but may occasionally affect performance. Overall, these methods demonstrate that numerical uncertainty can be exploited to reduce redundant computation and improve inference efficiency in CNNs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17180v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Proximal Optimization for Privacy-Preserving Heart Disease Prediction: A Controlled Simulation Study on Non-IID Clinical Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17183</link><description>arXiv:2601.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare institutions have access to valuable patient data that could be of great help in the development of improved diagnostic models, but privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR prevent hospitals from directly sharing data with one another. Federated Learning offers a way out to this problem by facilitating collaborative model training without having the raw patient data centralized. However, clinical datasets intrinsically have non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) features brought about by demographic disparity and diversity in disease prevalence and institutional practices. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation research of Federated Proximal Optimization (FedProx) for Heart Disease prediction based on UCI Heart Disease dataset. We generate realistic non-IID data partitions by simulating four heterogeneous hospital clients from the Cleveland Clinic dataset (303 patients), by inducing statistical heterogeneity by demographic-based stratification. Our experimental results show that FedProx with proximal parameter mu=0.05 achieves 85.00% accuracy, which is better than both centralized learning (83.33%) and isolated local models (78.45% average) without revealing patient privacy. Through generous sheer ablation studies with statistical validation on 50 independent runs we demonstrate that proximal regularization is effective in curbing client drift in heterogeneous environments. This proof-of-concept research offers algorithmic insights and practical deployment guidelines for real-world federated healthcare systems, and thus, our results are directly transferable to hospital IT-administrators, implementing privacy-preserving collaborative learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17183v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-Rate Quantized Matrix Multiplication: Theory and Practice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17187</link><description>arXiv:2601.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the problem of quantized matrix multiplication (MatMul), which has become crucial for the efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). We consider two settings: 1) Generic MatMul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $\Sigma_X$ of its columns. For each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. Specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax INT and floating-point (FP) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. Weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (WMSE) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector. We show how waterfilling can be used to improve practical LLM quantization algorithms (GPTQ), which at present allocate rate equally. This new scheme (termed ``WaterSIC'') only uses scalar INT quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $\Sigma_X$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\frac{2\pi e}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!). GPTQ's performance is affected by the choice of basis, but for a random rotation and actual $\Sigma_X$ from Llama-3-8B we find GPTQ to be within 0.1 bit (depending on the layer type) of WaterSIC, suggesting that GPTQ with random rotation is also near optimal (for high-rate quantization).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17187v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Implementing Tensor Logic: Unifying Datalog and Neural Reasoning via Tensor Contraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17188</link><description>arXiv:2601.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unification of symbolic reasoning and neural networks remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. Symbolic systems offer reliability and interpretability but lack scalability, while neural networks provide learning capabilities but sacrifice transparency. Tensor Logic, proposed by Domingos, suggests that logical rules and Einstein summation are mathematically equivalent, offering a principled path toward unification. This paper provides empirical validation of this framework through three experiments. First, we demonstrate the equivalence between recursive Datalog rules and iterative tensor contractions by computing the transitive closure of a biblical genealogy graph containing 1,972 individuals and 1,727 parent-child relationships, converging in 74 iterations to discover 33,945 ancestor relationships. Second, we implement reasoning in embedding space by training a neural network with learnable transformation matrices, demonstrating successful zero-shot compositional inference on held-out queries. Third, we validate the Tensor Logic superposition construction on FB15k-237, a large-scale knowledge graph with 14,541 entities and 237 relations. Using Domingos's relation matrix formulation $R_r = E^\top A_r E$, we achieve MRR of 0.3068 on standard link prediction and MRR of 0.3346 on a compositional reasoning benchmark where direct edges are removed during training, demonstrating that matrix composition enables multi-hop inference without direct training examples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17188v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Benchmarks for Differentially Private Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17189</link><description>arXiv:2601.17189v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: This chapter examines the global governance of artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of the Global AI Divide, focusing on disparities in AI development, innovation, and regulation. It highlights systemic inequities in education, digital infrastructure, and access to decision-making processes, perpetuating a dependency and exclusion cycle for Global Majority countries. The analysis also explores the dominance of Western nations and corporations in shaping AI governance frameworks, which often sideline the unique priorities and contexts of the Global Majority. Additionally, this chapter identifies emerging countertrends, such as national and regional AI strategies, as potential avenues for fostering equity and inclusivity in global AI governance. The chapter concludes with actionable recommendations to democratize AI governance for Majority World countries, emphasizing the importance of systemic reforms, resource redistribution, and meaningful participation. It calls for collaborative action to ensure AI governance becomes a catalyst for shared prosperity, addressing global disparities rather than deepening them.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17191v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PUNCH: Physics-informed Uncertainty-aware Network for Coronary Hemodynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17192</link><description>arXiv:2601.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) affects millions worldwide yet remains underdiagnosed because gold-standard physiological measurements are invasive and variably reproducible. We introduce a non-invasive, uncertainty-aware framework for estimating coronary flow reserve (CFR) directly from standard angiography. The system integrates physics-informed neural networks with variational inference to infer coronary blood flow from first-principles models of contrast transport, without requiring ground-truth flow measurements. The pipeline runs in approximately three minutes per patient on a single GPU, with no population-level training.
  Using 1{,}000 synthetic spatiotemporal intensity maps (kymographs) with controlled noise and artifacts, the framework reliably identifies degraded data and outputs appropriately inflated uncertainty estimates, showing strong correspondence between predictive uncertainty and error (Pearson $r = 0.997$, Spearman $\rho = 0.998$). Clinical validation in 12 patients shows strong agreement between PUNCH-derived CFR and invasive bolus thermodilution (Pearson $r = 0.90$, $p = 6.3 \times 10^{-5}$). We focus on the LAD, the artery most commonly assessed in routine CMD testing. Probabilistic CFR estimates have confidence intervals narrower than the variability of repeated invasive measurements.
  By transforming routine angiography into quantitative, uncertainty-aware assessment, this approach enables scalable, safer, and more reproducible evaluation of coronary microvascular function. Because standard angiography is widely available globally, the framework could expand access to CMD diagnosis and establish a new paradigm for physics-informed, patient-specific inference from clinical imaging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17192v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust and learning-augmented algorithms for degradation-aware battery optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17193</link><description>arXiv:2601.17193v1 Announce Type: new

We formulate this task as an online resource allocation problem. We propose an algorithm, based on online mirror descent, that is no-regret in the stochastic i.i.d. setting and attains finite asymptotic competitive ratio in the adversarial setting (robustness).

Abstract: Social infrastructure and other built environments are increasingly expected to support well-being and community resilience by enabling social interaction. Yet in civil and built-environment research, there is no consistent and privacy-preserving way to represent and measure socially meaningful interaction in these spaces, leaving studies to operationalize "interaction" differently across contexts and limiting practitioners' ability to evaluate whether design interventions are changing the forms of interaction that social capital theory predicts should matter. To address this field-level and methodological gap, we introduce the Dyadic User Engagement DataseT (DUET) dataset and an embedded kinesics recognition framework that operationalize Ekman and Friesen's kinesics taxonomy as a function-level interaction vocabulary aligned with social capital-relevant behaviors (e.g., reciprocity and attention coordination). DUET captures 12 dyadic interactions spanning all five kinesic functions-emblems, illustrators, affect displays, adaptors, and regulators-across four sensing modalities and three built-environment contexts, enabling privacy-preserving analysis of communicative intent through movement. Benchmarking six open-source, state-of-the-art human activity recognition models quantifies the difficulty of communicative-function recognition on DUET and highlights the limitations of ubiquitous monadic, action-level recognition when extended to dyadic, socially grounded interaction measurement. Building on DUET, our recognition framework infers communicative function directly from privacy-preserving skeletal motion without handcrafted action-to-function dictionaries; using a transfer-learning architecture, it reveals structured clustering of kinesic functions and a strong association between representation quality and classification performance while generalizing across subjects and contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17194v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AstroTimer: Rethinking Non-Access Stratum Timers in LEO Constellations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17195</link><description>arXiv:2601.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations expand 5G coverage to remote regions but differ fundamentally from terrestrial networks due to rapidly changing topologies, fluctuating delays, and constrained onboard resources. Existing 3GPP Non-Access Stratum (NAS) timers, inherited from terrestrial and geostationary (GEO) or medium Earth orbit (MEO) systems, fail to accommodate these dynamics, leading to signaling storms and inefficiency. This paper introduces AstroTimer, a lightweight, adaptive framework for sizing NAS timers based on LEO-specific parameters such as link variability, processing delays, and network-function placement. AstroTimer derives a closed-form timer model with low computational cost and optimizes both watchdog and backoff timers for the 5G registration procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that AstroTimer significantly reduces registration time, retry frequency, and user equipment (UE) energy consumption compared to 3GPP defaults, while preventing signaling overloads. The proposed approach provides an operator-ready foundation for reliable, efficient, and scalable non-terrestrial 5G/6G deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17195v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning Beyond Literal: Cross-style Multimodal Reasoning for Figurative Language Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17197</link><description>arXiv:2601.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in literal multimodal tasks such as visual mathematics and science question answering. However, figurative language, such as sarcasm, humor, and metaphor, remains a significant challenge, as it conveys intent and emotion through subtle incongruities between expressed and intended meanings. In multimodal settings, accompanying images can amplify or invert textual meaning, demanding models that reason across modalities and account for subjectivity. We propose a three-step framework for developing efficient multimodal reasoning models that can (i) interpret multimodal figurative language, (ii) provide transparent reasoning traces, and (iii) generalize across multiple figurative styles. Experiments across four styles show that (1) incorporating reasoning traces substantially improves multimodal figurative understanding, (2) reasoning learned in one style can transfer to others, especially between related styles like sarcasm and humor, and (3) training jointly across styles yields a generalized reasoning VLM that outperforms much larger open- and closed-source models. Our findings show that lightweight VLMs with verifiable reasoning achieve robust cross-style generalization while providing inspectable reasoning traces for multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Modern models for common NLP tasks often employ machine learning techniques and train on journalistic, social media, or other culturally-derived text. These have recently been scrutinized for racial and gender biases, rooting from inherent bias in their training text. These biases are often sub-optimal and recent work poses methods to rectify them; however, these biases may shed light on actual racial or gender gaps in the culture(s) that produced the training text, thereby helping us understand cultural context through big data. This paper presents an approach for quantifying gender bias in word embeddings, and then using them to characterize statistical gender gaps in education, politics, economics, and health. We validate these metrics on 2018 Twitter data spanning 51 U.S. regions and 99 countries. We correlate state and country word embedding biases with 18 international and 5 U.S.-based statistical gender gaps, characterizing regularities and predictive strength.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17203v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SpecBridge: Bridging Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Representations via Cross-Modal Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17204</link><description>arXiv:2601.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-molecule identification from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) remains a bottleneck in untargeted settings where spectral libraries are incomplete. While deep learning offers a solution, current approaches typically fall into two extremes: explicit generative models that construct molecular graphs atom-by-atom, or joint contrastive models that learn cross-modal subspaces from scratch. We introduce SpecBridge, a novel implicit alignment framework that treats structure identification as a geometric alignment problem. SpecBridge fine-tunes a self-supervised spectral encoder (DreaMS) to project directly into the latent space of a frozen molecular foundation model (ChemBERTa), and then performs retrieval by cosine similarity to a fixed bank of precomputed molecular embeddings. Across MassSpecGym, Spectraverse, and MSnLib benchmarks, SpecBridge improves top-1 retrieval accuracy by roughly 20-25% relative to strong neural baselines, while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. These results suggest that aligning to frozen foundation models is a practical, stable alternative to designing new architectures from scratch. The code for SpecBridge is released at https://github.com/HassounLab/SpecBridge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17204v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NewPINNs: Physics-Informing Neural Networks Using Conventional Solvers for Partial Differential Equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17207</link><description>arXiv:2601.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NewPINNs, a physics-informing learning framework that couples neural networks with conventional numerical solvers for solving differential equations. Rather than enforcing governing equations and boundary conditions through residual-based loss terms, NewPINNs integrates the solver directly into the training loop and defines learning objectives through solver-consistency. The neural network produces candidate solution states that are advanced by the numerical solver, and training minimizes the discrepancy between the network prediction and the solver-evolved state. This pull-push interaction enables the network to learn physically admissible solutions through repeated exposure to the solver's action, without requiring problem-specific loss engineering or explicit evaluation of differential equation residuals. By delegating the enforcement of physics, boundary conditions, and numerical stability to established numerical solvers, NewPINNs mitigates several well-known failure modes of standard physics-informed neural networks, including optimization pathologies, sensitivity to loss weighting, and poor performance in stiff or nonlinear regimes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across multiple forward and inverse problems involving finite volume, finite element, and spectral solvers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Polynomial Chaos-based Input Shaper Design under Time-Varying Uncertainty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17209</link><description>arXiv:2601.17209v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We adapt structural complexity analysis to three-dimensional signals, with an emphasis on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This framework captures the multiscale organization of volumetric data by coarse-graining the signal at progressively larger spatial scales and quantifying the information lost between successive resolutions. While the traditional block-based approach can become unstable at coarse resolutions due to limited sampling, we introduce a sliding-window coarse-graining scheme that provides smoother estimates and improved robustness at large scales. Using this refined method, we analyze large structural MRI datasets spanning mid- to late adulthood and find that structural complexity decreases systematically with age, with the strongest effects emerging at coarser scales. These findings highlight structural complexity as a reliable signal processing tool for multiscale analysis of 3D imaging data, while also demonstrating its utility in predicting biological age from brain MRI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17211v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DF-RAG: Query-Aware Diversity for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17212</link><description>arXiv:2601.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common technique for grounding language model outputs in domain-specific information. However, RAG is often challenged by reasoning-intensive question-answering (QA), since common retrieval methods like cosine similarity maximize relevance at the cost of introducing redundant content, which can reduce information recall. To address this, we introduce Diversity-Focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DF-RAG), which systematically incorporates diversity into the retrieval step to improve performance on complex, reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks. DF-RAG builds upon the Maximal Marginal Relevance framework to select information chunks that are both relevant to the query and maximally dissimilar from each other. A key innovation of DF-RAG is its ability to optimize the level of diversity for each query dynamically at test time without requiring any additional fine-tuning or prior information. We show that DF-RAG improves F1 performance on reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks by 4-10 percent over vanilla RAG using cosine similarity and also outperforms other established baselines. Furthermore, we estimate an Oracle ceiling of up to 18 percent absolute F1 gains over vanilla RAG, of which DF-RAG captures up to 91.3 percent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17212v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] JetFormer: A Scalable and Efficient Transformer for Jet Tagging from Offline Analysis to FPGA Triggers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17215</link><description>arXiv:2601.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JetFormer, a versatile and scalable encoder-only Transformer architecture for particle jet tagging at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Unlike prior approaches that are often tailored to specific deployment regimes, JetFormer is designed to operate effectively across the full spectrum of jet tagging scenarios, from high-accuracy offline analysis to ultra-low-latency online triggering. The model processes variable-length sets of particle features without relying on input of explicit pairwise interactions, yet achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. On the large-scale JetClass dataset, a large-scale JetFormer matches the accuracy of the interaction-rich ParT model (within 0.7%) while using 37.4% fewer FLOPs, demonstrating its computational efficiency and strong generalization. On benchmark HLS4ML 150P datasets, JetFormer consistently outperforms existing models such as MLPs, Deep Sets, and Interaction Networks by 3-4% in accuracy. To bridge the gap to hardware deployment, we further introduce a hardware-aware optimization pipeline based on multi-objective hyperparameter search, yielding compact variants like JetFormer-tiny suitable for FPGA-based trigger systems with sub-microsecond latency requirements. Through structured pruning and quantization, we show that JetFormer can be aggressively compressed with minimal accuracy loss. By unifying high-performance modeling and deployability within a single architectural framework, JetFormer provides a practical pathway for deploying Transformer-based jet taggers in both offline and online environments at the LHC.

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demand real-time collision prediction to ensure road safety and reduce accident severity. Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17216v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluation on Entity Matching in Recommender Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17218</link><description>arXiv:2601.17218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entity matching is a crucial component in various recommender systems, including conversational recommender systems (CRS) and knowledge-based recommender systems. However, the lack of rigorous evaluation frameworks for cross-dataset entity matching impedes progress in areas such as LLM-driven conversational recommendations and knowledge-grounded dataset construction.
  In this paper, we introduce Reddit-Amazon-EM, a novel dataset comprising naturally occurring items from Reddit and the Amazon '23 dataset. Through careful manual annotation, we identify corresponding movies across Reddit-Movies and Amazon'23, two existing recommender system datasets with inherently overlapping catalogs. Leveraging Reddit-Amazon-EM, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art entity matching methods, including rule-based, graph-based, lexical-based, embedding-based, and LLM-based approaches.
  For reproducible research, we release our manually annotated entity matching gold set and provide the mapping between the two datasets using the best-performing method from our experiments. This serves as a valuable resource for advancing future work on entity matching in recommender systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17218v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Advancing Improvisation in Human-Robot Construction Collaboration: Taxonomy and Research Roadmap</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17219</link><description>arXiv:2601.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction industry faces productivity stagnation, skilled labor shortages, and safety concerns. While robotic automation offers solutions, construction robots struggle to adapt to unstructured, dynamic sites. Central to this is improvisation, adapting to unexpected situations through creative problem-solving, which remains predominantly human. In construction's unpredictable environments, collaborative human-robot improvisation is essential for workflow continuity. This research develops a six-level taxonomy classifying human-robot collaboration (HRC) based on improvisation capabilities. Through systematic review of 214 articles (2010-2025), we categorize construction robotics across: Manual Work (Level 0), Human-Controlled Execution (Level 1), Adaptive Manipulation (Level 2), Imitation Learning (Level 3), Human-in-Loop BIM Workflow (Level 4), Cloud-Based Knowledge Integration (Level 5), and True Collaborative Improvisation (Level 6). Analysis reveals current research concentrates at lower levels, with critical gaps in experiential learning and limited progression toward collaborative improvisation. A five-dimensional radar framework illustrates progressive evolution of Planning, Cognitive Role, Physical Execution, Learning Capability, and Improvisation, demonstrating how complementary human-robot capabilities create team performance exceeding individual contributions. The research identifies three fundamental barriers: technical limitations in grounding and dialogic reasoning, conceptual gaps between human improvisation and robotics research, and methodological challenges. We recommend future research emphasizing improved human-robot communication via Augmented/Virtual Reality interfaces, large language model integration, and cloud-based knowledge systems to advance toward true collaborative improvisation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vidformer: Drop-in Declarative Optimization for Rendering Video-Native Query Results</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17221</link><description>arXiv:2601.17221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When interactively exploring video data, video-native querying involves consuming query results as videos, including steps such as compilation of extracted video clips or data overlays. These video-native queries are bottlenecked by rendering, not the execution of the underlying queries. This rendering is currently performed using post-processing scripts that are often slow. This step poses a critical point of friction in interactive video data workloads: even short clips contain thousands of high-definition frames; conventional OpenCV/Python scripts must decode -&gt; transform -&gt; encode the entire data stream before a single pixel appears, leaving users waiting for many seconds, minutes, or hours.
  To address these issues, we present Vidformer, a drop-in rendering accelerator for video-native querying which, (i) transparently lifts existing visualization code into a declarative representation, (ii) transparently optimizes and parallelizes rendering, and (iii) instantly serves videos through a Video on Demand protocol with just-in-time segment rendering. We demonstrate that Vidformer cuts full-render time by 2-3x across diverse annotation workloads, and, more critically, drops time-to-playback to 0.25-0.5s. This represents a 400x improvement that decouples clip length from first-frame playback latency, and unlocks the ability to perform interactive video-native querying with sub-second latencies. Furthermore, we show how our approach enables interactive video-native LLM-based conversational querying as well.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17221v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Outcome Verification: Verifiable Process Reward Models for Structured Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17223</link><description>arXiv:2601.17223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved using outcome-level verification signals, such as unit tests for code or exact-match checks for mathematics. In parallel, process supervision has long been explored as a way to shape the intermediate reasoning behaviour of LLMs, but existing approaches rely on neural judges to score chain-of-thought steps, leaving them vulnerable to opacity, bias, and reward hacking. To address this gap, we introduce Verifiable Process Reward Models (VPRMs), a reinforcement-learning framework in which intermediate reasoning steps are checked by deterministic, rule-based verifiers. We apply VPRMs to risk-of-bias assessment for medical evidence synthesis, a domain where guideline-defined criteria and rule-based decision paths enable programmatic verification of reasoning traces. Across multiple datasets, we find that VPRMs generate reasoning that adheres closely to domain rules and achieve substantially higher coherence between step-level decisions and final labels. Results show that VPRMs achieve up to 20% higher F1 than state-of-the-art models and 6.5% higher than verifiable outcome rewards, with substantial gains in evidence grounding and logical coherence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17223v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parameter Inference and Uncertainty Quantification with Diffusion Models: Extending CDI to 2D Spatial Conditioning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17224</link><description>arXiv:2601.17224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical in scientific inverse problems to distinguish identifiable parameters from those that remain ambiguous given available measurements. The Conditional Diffusion Model-based Inverse Problem Solver (CDI) has previously demonstrated effective probabilistic inference for one-dimensional temporal signals, but its applicability to higher-dimensional spatial data remains unexplored. We extend CDI to two-dimensional spatial conditioning, enabling probabilistic parameter inference directly from spatial observations. We validate this extension on convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) parameter inference - a challenging multi-parameter inverse problem in materials characterization where sample geometry, electronic structure, and thermal properties must be extracted from 2D diffraction patterns. Using simulated CBED data with ground-truth parameters, we demonstrate that CDI produces well-calibrated posterior distributions that accurately reflect measurement constraints: tight distributions for well-determined quantities and appropriately broad distributions for ambiguous parameters. In contrast, standard regression methods - while appearing accurate on aggregate metrics - mask this underlying uncertainty by predicting training set means for poorly constrained parameters. Our results confirm that CDI successfully extends from temporal to spatial domains, providing the genuine uncertainty information required for robust scientific inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17224v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Risk Thresholds for AI-Enabled Cyber Threats: Enhancing Decision-Making Under Uncertainty with Bayesian Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17225</link><description>arXiv:2601.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used to augment and automate cyber operations, altering the scale, speed, and accessibility of malicious activity. These shifts raise urgent questions about when AI systems introduce unacceptable or intolerable cyber risk, and how risk thresholds should be identified before harms materialize at scale. In recent years, industry, government, and civil society actors have begun to articulate such thresholds for advanced AI systems, with the goal of signaling when models meaningfully amplify cyber threats, for example, by automating multi-stage intrusions, enabling zero-day discovery, or lowering the expertise required for sophisticated attacks. However, current approaches to determine these thresholds remain fragmented and limited. Many thresholds rely solely on capability benchmarks or narrow threat scenarios, and are weakly connected to empirical evidence. This paper proposes a structured approach to developing and evaluating AI cyber risk thresholds that is probabilistic, evidence-based, and operationalizable. In this paper we make three core contributions that build on our prior work that highlights the limitations of relying solely on capability assessments. First, we analyze existing industry cyber thresholds and identify common threshold elements as well as recurring methodological shortcomings. Second, we propose the use of Bayesian networks as a tool for modeling AI-enabled cyber risk, enabling the integration of heterogeneous evidence, explicit representation of uncertainty, and continuous updating as new information emerges. Third, we illustrate this approach through a focused case study on AI-augmented phishing, demonstrating how qualitative threat insights can be decomposed into measurable variables and recombined into structured risk estimates that better capture how AI changes attacker behavior and outcomes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17225v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Retell, Reward, Repeat: Reinforcement Learning for Narrative Theory-Informed Story Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17226</link><description>arXiv:2601.17226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the subjective nature of storytelling, past works on automatic story generation (ASG) have relied on limited ground truths for training and evaluation. In this work, we explore reinforcement learning (d-RLAIF) as a post-training alternative to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We first apply Todorov's Theory of Narrative Equilibrium to establish principles that define desirable ASG qualities. We prompt 7B and 14B LLM-as-judge models with our principles to test alignment with human annotators and provide reward signals during d-RLAIF. We use Gemini-3-Flash to evaluate the output of our post-trained models and compare them to human-written stories from the TimeTravel dataset. We show that d-RLAIF offers a viable alternative to supervised fine-tuning (SFT)--producing stories that are more diverse and aligned with human narrative conventions. Our paper demonstrates the promise of reinforcement learning for linguistically grounded post-training for subjective tasks such as ASG.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17226v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Informative Path Planning via Graph Guidance and Trajectory Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17227</link><description>arXiv:2601.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study informative path planning (IPP) with travel budgets in cluttered environments, where an agent collects measurements of a latent field modeled as a Gaussian process (GP) to reduce uncertainty at target locations. Graph-based solvers provide global guarantees but assume pre-selected measurement locations, while continuous trajectory optimization supports path-based sensing but is computationally intensive and sensitive to initialization in obstacle-dense settings. We propose a hierarchical framework with three stages: (i) graph-based global planning, (ii) segment-wise budget allocation using geometric and kernel bounds, and (iii) spline-based refinement of each segment with hard constraints and obstacle pruning. By combining global guidance with local refinement, our method achieves lower posterior uncertainty than graph-only and continuous baselines, while running faster than continuous-space solvers (up to 9x faster than gradient-based methods and 20x faster than black-box optimizers) across synthetic cluttered environments and Arctic datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17227v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation with Latent Diffusion for Pathology Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17228</link><description>arXiv:2601.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models in computational pathology often fail to generalize across cohorts and institutions due to domain shift. Existing approaches either fail to leverage unlabeled data from the target domain or rely on image-to-image translation, which can distort tissue structures and compromise model accuracy. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that utilizes a latent diffusion model trained on unlabeled data from both the source and target domains to generate morphology-preserving and target-aware synthetic images. By conditioning the diffusion model on foundation model features, cohort identity, and tissue preparation method, we preserve tissue structure in the source domain while introducing target-domain appearance characteristics. The target-aware synthetic images, combined with real, labeled images from the source cohort, are subsequently used to train a downstream classifier, which is then tested on the target cohort. The effectiveness of the proposed SSDA framework is demonstrated on the task of lung adenocarcinoma prognostication. The proposed augmentation yielded substantially better performance on the held-out test set from the target cohort, without degrading source-cohort performance. The approach improved the weighted F1 score on the target-cohort held-out test set from 0.611 to 0.706 and the macro F1 score from 0.641 to 0.716. Our results demonstrate that target-aware diffusion-based synthetic data augmentation provides a promising and effective approach for improving domain generalization in computational pathology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CaseFacts: A Benchmark for Legal Fact-Checking and Precedent Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17230</link><description>arXiv:2601.17230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Fact-Checking has largely focused on verifying general knowledge against static corpora, overlooking high-stakes domains like law where truth is evolving and technically complex. We introduce CaseFacts, a benchmark for verifying colloquial legal claims against U.S. Supreme Court precedents. Unlike existing resources that map formal texts to formal texts, CaseFacts challenges systems to bridge the semantic gap between layperson assertions and technical jurisprudence while accounting for temporal validity. The dataset consists of 6,294 claims categorized as Supported, Refuted, or Overruled. We construct this benchmark using a multi-stage pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize claims from expert case summaries, employing a novel semantic similarity heuristic to efficiently identify and verify complex legal overrulings. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that the task remains challenging; notably, augmenting models with unrestricted web search degrades performance compared to closed-book baselines due to the retrieval of noisy, non-authoritative precedents. We release CaseFacts to spur research into legal fact verification systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time, Energy-Efficient, Sampling-Based Optimal Control via FPGA Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17231</link><description>arXiv:2601.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), used for search-and-rescue and remote exploration, require fast and robust planning and control schemes. Sampling-based approaches for Model Predictive Control, especially approaches based on the Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) algorithm, have recently proven both to be highly effective for such applications and to map naturally to GPUs for hardware acceleration. However, both GPU and CPU implementations of such algorithms can struggle to meet tight energy and latency budgets on battery-constrained AMR platforms that leverage embedded compute. To address this issue, we present an FPGA-optimized MPPI design that exposes fine-grained parallelism and eliminates synchronization bottlenecks via deep pipelining and parallelism across algorithmic stages. This results in an average 3.1x to 7.5x speedup over optimized implementations on an embedded GPU and CPU, respectively, while simultaneously achieving a 2.5x to 5.4x reduction in energy usage. These results demonstrate that FPGA architectures are a promising direction for energy-efficient and high-performance edge robotics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Frame-Guided Synthetic Claim Generation for Automatic Fact-Checking Using High-Volume Tabular Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17232</link><description>arXiv:2601.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated fact-checking benchmarks have largely ignored the challenge of verifying claims against real-world, high-volume structured data, instead focusing on small, curated tables. We introduce a new large-scale, multilingual dataset to address this critical gap. It contains 78,503 synthetic claims grounded in 434 complex OECD tables, which average over 500K rows each. We propose a novel, frame-guided methodology where algorithms programmatically select significant data points based on six semantic frames to generate realistic claims in English, Chinese, Spanish, and Hindi. Crucially, we demonstrate through knowledge-probing experiments that LLMs have not memorized these facts, forcing systems to perform genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than relying on parameterized knowledge. We provide a baseline SQL-generation system and show that our benchmark is highly challenging. Our analysis identifies evidence retrieval as the primary bottleneck, with models struggling to find the correct data in massive tables. This dataset provides a critical new resource for advancing research on this unsolved, real-world problem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17232v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] C-RADIOv4 (Tech Report)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17237</link><description>arXiv:2601.17237v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Mobile video calls are widely used to share information about real-world objects and environments with remote collaborators. While these calls provide valuable visual context in real time, the experience of interacting with people and moving around a space is significantly reduced when compared to co-located conversations. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of Mobile Augmented Reality applications to enable more spatial forms of collaboration across distance. To better understand the dynamics of mobile AR collaboration and how this medium compares against the status quo, we conducted a comparative structured observation study to analyze people's perception of space and interaction with remote collaborators across mobile video calls and AR-based calls. Fourteen pairs of participants completed a spatial collaboration task using each medium. Through a mixed-methods analysis of session videos, transcripts, motion logs, post-task exercises, and interviews, we highlight how the choice of medium influences the roles and responsibilities that collaborators take on and the construction of a shared language for coordination. We discuss the importance of spatial reasoning with one's body, how video calls help participants "be on the same page" more directly, and how AR calls enable both onsite and remote collaborators to engage with the space and each other in ways that resemble in-person interaction. Our study offers a nuanced view of the benefits and limitations of both mediums, and we conclude with a discussion of design implications for future systems that integrate mobile video and AR to better support spatial collaboration in its many forms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17238v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Needs and Design Opportunities for Proactive Information Support in In-Person Small-Group Conversations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17240</link><description>arXiv:2601.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-person small-group conversations play a crucial role in everyday life; however, facilitating effective group interaction can be challenging, as the real-time nature demands full attention, offers no opportunity for revision, and requires interpreting non-verbal cues. Using Mixed Reality to provide proactive information support shows promise in helping individuals engage in and contribute to group conversations. We present a preliminary participatory design and qualitative study (N = 10) using focus groups and two technology probes to explore the opportunities of designing proactive information support in in-person small-group conversations. We reveal key design opportunities concerning how to maximize the benefits of proactive information support and how to effectively design such supporting information. Our study is crucial for paving the way toward designing future proactive AI agents to enable the paradigm of augmented in-person small-group conversation experience.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17240v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EMPM: Embodied MPM for Modeling and Simulation of Deformable Objects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17251</link><description>arXiv:2601.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling deformable objects - especially continuum materials - in a way that is physically plausible, generalizable, and data-efficient remains challenging across 3D vision, graphics, and robotic manipulation. Many existing methods oversimplify the rich dynamics of deformable objects or require large training sets, which often limits generalization. We introduce embodied MPM (EMPM), a deformable object modeling and simulation framework built on a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) simulator that captures the dynamics of challenging materials. From multi-view RGB-D videos, our approach reconstructs geometry and appearance, then uses an MPM physics engine to simulate object behavior by minimizing the mismatch between predicted and observed visual data. We further optimize MPM parameters online using sensory feedback, enabling adaptive, robust, and physics-aware object representations that open new possibilities for robotic manipulation of complex deformables. Experiments show that EMPM outperforms spring-mass baseline models.

Abstract: In Japan, civil infrastructure condition monitoring is mandated through visual inspection every five years. Field-captured damage images frequently contain concrete cracks and rebar exposure, often accompanied by construction signs revealing regional information. To enable safe infrastructure use without causing public anxiety, it is essential to protect regional information while accurately extracting damage features and visualizing key indicators for repair decision-making. This paper presents an open-source bridge damage detection system with regional privacy protection capabilities.

Abstract: The advancement of vehicle automation and the growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) are reshaping transportation systems. While fully automated vehicles are expected to improve traffic stability, efficiency, and sustainability, recent studies suggest that partially automated vehicles, such as those equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), may adversely affect traffic flow. These drawbacks may not extend to ACC-enabled EVs due to their distinct mechanical characteristics, including regenerative braking and smoother torque delivery. As a result, the impacts of EVs operating under ACC remain insufficiently understood.
  To address this gap, this study develops an empirical framework using the OpenACC dataset to compare ACC-enabled EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles. Dynamic time warping aligns comparable lead-vehicle trajectories. Results show that EVs exhibit smoother speed profiles, lower speed variability, and shorter spacing, leading to higher efficiency. EVs reduce critical safety events by over 85% and lower platoon-level emissions by up to 26.2%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17256v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Constrained Optimization Perspective of Unrolled Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17257</link><description>arXiv:2601.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a constrained optimization framework for training transformers that behave like optimization descent algorithms. Specifically, we enforce layerwise descent constraints on the objective function and replace standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) with a primal-dual training scheme. This approach yields models whose intermediate representations decrease the loss monotonically in expectation across layers. We apply our method to both unrolled transformer architectures and conventional pretrained transformers on tasks of video denoising and text classification. Across these settings, we observe constrained transformers achieve stronger robustness to perturbations and maintain higher out-of-distribution generalization, while preserving in-distribution performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17257v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FineVAU: A Novel Human-Aligned Benchmark for Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17258</link><description>arXiv:2601.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) is a novel task focused on describing unusual occurrences in videos. Despite growing interest, the evaluation of VAU remains an open challenge. Existing benchmarks rely on n-gram-based metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE-L) or LLM-based evaluation. The first fails to capture the rich, free-form, and visually grounded nature of LVLM responses, while the latter focuses on assessing language quality over factual relevance, often resulting in subjective judgments that are misaligned with human perception. In this work, we address this issue by proposing FineVAU, a new benchmark for VAU that shifts the focus towards rich, fine-grained and domain-specific understanding of anomalous videos. We formulate VAU as a three-fold problem, with the goal of comprehensively understanding key descriptive elements of anomalies in video: events (What), participating entities (Who) and location (Where). Our benchmark introduces a) FVScore, a novel, human-aligned evaluation metric that assesses the presence of critical visual elements in LVLM answers, providing interpretable, fine-grained feedback; and b) FineW3, a novel, comprehensive dataset curated through a structured and fully automatic procedure that augments existing human annotations with high quality, fine-grained visual information. Human evaluation reveals that our proposed metric has a superior alignment with human perception of anomalies in comparison to current approaches. Detailed experiments on FineVAU unveil critical limitations in LVLM's ability to perceive anomalous events that require spatial and fine-grained temporal understanding, despite strong performance on coarse grain, static information, and events with strong visual cues.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17258v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inference-Time Loss-Guided Colour Preservation in Diffusion Sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17259</link><description>arXiv:2601.17259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise color control remains a persistent failure mode in text-to-image diffusion systems, particularly in design-oriented workflows where outputs must satisfy explicit, user-specified color targets. We present an inference-time, region-constrained color preservation method that steers a pretrained diffusion model without any additional training. Our approach combines (i) ROI-based inpainting for spatial selectivity, (ii) background-latent re-imposition to prevent color drift outside the ROI, and (iii) latent nudging via gradient guidance using a composite loss defined in CIE Lab and linear RGB. The loss is constructed to control not only the mean ROI color but also the tail of the pixelwise error distribution through CVaR-style and soft-maximum penalties, with a late-start gate and a time-dependent schedule to stabilize guidance across denoising steps. We show that mean-only baselines can satisfy average color constraints while producing perceptually salient local failures, motivating our distribution-aware objective. The resulting method provides a practical, training-free mechanism for targeted color adherence that can be integrated into standard Stable Diffusion inpainting pipelines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17259v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Viscosity of Logic: Phase Transitions and Hysteresis in DPO Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17260</link><description>arXiv:2601.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is often tuned as if increasing alignment pressure (controlled by $\beta$) yields progressively "better" behavior. We instead treat $\beta$ as a control parameter and densely sweep it for three 7B open-weight families under a fixed DPO recipe. In Mistral, capability is sharply non-monotonic: aggregated logic-probe margins become positive only in a narrow band near $\beta \approx 10^{-2}$ and revert outside it, with boundary points that are seed-sensitive. Across architectures under the same sweep, we observe qualitatively different response modes: sharp reorganization in Mistral, selective changes in Llama, and smooth trade-offs in Qwen. Critically, the DPO preference margin can anticorrelate with reasoning capability (Pearson $r=-0.91$ for Llama logic), so margin-based selection can prefer capability-impaired models. Training path also matters: exposure to high $\beta$ induces capability losses that persist even after $\beta$ is reduced (hysteresis). These findings motivate capability-resolved evaluation across the $\beta$ landscape rather than reliance on margins or aggregate benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17260v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AGZO: Activation-Guided Zeroth-Order Optimization for LLM Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17261</link><description>arXiv:2601.17261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization has emerged as a promising solution for fine-tuning LLMs under strict memory constraints, as it avoids the prohibitive memory cost of storing activations for backpropagation. However, existing ZO methods typically employ isotropic perturbations, neglecting the rich structural information available during the forward pass. In this paper, we identify a crucial link between gradient formation and activation structure: the gradient of a linear layer is confined to the subspace spanned by its input activations. Leveraging this insight, we propose Activation-Guided Zeroth-Order optimization (AGZO). Unlike prior methods, AGZO extracts a compact, activation-informed subspace on the fly during the forward pass and restricts perturbations to this low-rank subspace. We provide a theoretical framework showing that AGZO optimizes a subspace-smoothed objective and provably yields update directions with higher cosine similarity to the true gradient than isotropic baselines. Empirically, we evaluate AGZO on Qwen3 and Pangu models across various benchmarks. AGZO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ZO baselines and significantly narrows the performance gap with first-order fine-tuning, while maintaining almost the same peak memory footprint as other ZO methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17261v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Strategic AI in Cournot Markets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17263</link><description>arXiv:2601.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence increasingly automates decision-making in competitive markets, understanding the resulting dynamics and ensuring fair market mechanisms is essential. We investigate the multi-faceted decision-making of large language models (LLMs) in oligopolistic Cournot markets, showing that LLMs not only grasp complex market dynamics--demonstrating their potential as effective economic planning agents--but also engage in sustained tacit collusion, driving prices up to 200% above Nash equilibrium levels. Our analysis examines LLM behavior across three dimensions-(1) decision type, (2) opponent strategies, and (3) market composition--revealing how these factors may shape the competitiveness of LLM-based decision-makers. Furthermore, we show that regulating a few dominant agents by enforcing best-response strategies effectively disrupts collusion and helps restore competitive pricing. Our findings identify potential concerns associated with AI integration in competitive market environments and provide regulatory policy recommendations for the era of automation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17263v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Window Size Versus Accuracy Experiments in Voice Activity Detectors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17270</link><description>arXiv:2601.17270v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: 360{\deg} depth estimation is a challenging research problem due to the difficulty of finding a representation that both preserves global continuity and avoids distortion in spherical images. Existing methods attempt to leverage complementary information from multiple projections, but struggle with balancing global and local consistency. Their local patch features have limited global perception, and the combined global representation does not address discrepancies in feature extraction at the boundaries between patches. To address these issues, we propose Cross360, a novel cross-attention-based architecture integrating local and global information using less-distorted tangent patches along with equirectangular features. Our Cross Projection Feature Alignment module employs cross-attention to align local tangent projection features with the equirectangular projection's 360{\deg} field of view, ensuring each tangent projection patch is aware of the global context. Additionally, our Progressive Feature Aggregation with Attention module refines multi-scaled features progressively, enhancing depth estimation accuracy. Cross360 significantly outperforms existing methods across most benchmark datasets, especially those in which the entire 360{\deg} image is available, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurate and globally consistent depth estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop unrolled neural networks to solve constrained optimization problems, offering accelerated, learnable counterparts to dual ascent (DA) algorithms. Our framework, termed constrained dual unrolling (CDU), comprises two coupled neural networks that jointly approximate the saddle point of the Lagrangian. The primal network emulates an iterative optimizer that finds a stationary point of the Lagrangian for a given dual multiplier, sampled from an unknown distribution. The dual network generates trajectories towards the optimal multipliers across its layers while querying the primal network at each layer. Departing from standard unrolling, we induce DA dynamics by imposing primal-descent and dual-ascent constraints through constrained learning. We formulate training the two networks as a nested optimization problem and propose an alternating procedure that updates the primal and dual networks in turn, mitigating uncertainty in the multiplier distribution required for primal network training. We numerically evaluate the framework on mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) and power allocation in wireless networks. In both cases, our approach yields near-optimal near-feasible solutions and exhibits strong out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17274v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Latent-Space Contrastive Reinforcement Learning for Stable and Efficient LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17275</link><description>arXiv:2601.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in surface-level text generation, their nature in handling complex multi-step reasoning tasks often remains one of ``statistical fitting'' rather than systematic logical deduction. Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) attempts to mitigate this by introducing a ``think-before-speak'' paradigm. However, applying RL directly in high-dimensional, discrete token spaces faces three inherent challenges: sample-inefficient rollouts, high gradient estimation variance, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To fundamentally address these structural bottlenecks, we propose \textbf{DeepLatent Reasoning (DLR)}, a latent-space bidirectional contrastive reinforcement learning framework. This framework shifts the trial-and-error cost from expensive token-level full sequence generation to the continuous latent manifold. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight assistant model to efficiently sample $K$ reasoning chain encodings within the latent space. These encodings are filtered via a dual reward mechanism based on correctness and formatting; only high-value latent trajectories are fed into a \textbf{frozen main model} for single-pass decoding. To maximize reasoning diversity while maintaining coherence, we design a contrastive learning objective to enable directed exploration within the latent space. Since the main model parameters remain frozen during optimization, this method mathematically eliminates catastrophic forgetting. Experiments demonstrate that under comparable GPU computational budgets, DLR achieves more stable training convergence, supports longer-horizon reasoning chains, and facilitates the sustainable accumulation of reasoning capabilities, providing a viable path toward reliable and scalable reinforcement learning for LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17275v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PingPong: A Natural Benchmark for Multi-Turn Code-Switching Dialogues</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17277</link><description>arXiv:2601.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-switching is a widespread practice among the world's multilingual majority, yet few benchmarks accurately reflect its complexity in everyday communication. We present PingPong, a benchmark for natural multi-party code-switching dialogues covering five language-combination variations, some of which are trilingual. Our dataset consists of human-authored conversations among 2 to 4 participants covering authentic, multi-threaded structures where replies frequently reference much earlier points in the dialogue. We demonstrate that our data is significantly more natural and structurally diverse than machine-generated alternatives, offering greater variation in message length, speaker dominance, and reply distance. Based on these dialogues, we define three downstream tasks: Question Answering, Dialogue Summarization, and Topic Classification. Evaluations of several state-of-the-art language models on PingPong reveal that performance remains limited on code-switched inputs, underscoring the urgent need for more robust NLP systems capable of addressing the intricacies of real-world multilingual discourse.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17277v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPADE: A SIMD Posit-enabled compute engine for Accelerating DNN Efficiency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17279</link><description>arXiv:2601.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for edge-AI systems requires arithmetic units that balance numerical precision, energy efficiency, and compact hardware while supporting diverse formats. Posit arithmetic offers advantages over floating- and fixed-point representations through its tapered precision, wide dynamic range, and improved numerical robustness. This work presents SPADE, a unified multi-precision SIMD Posit-based multiplyaccumulate (MAC) architecture supporting Posit (8,0), Posit (16,1), and Posit (32,2) within a single framework. Unlike prior single-precision or floating/fixed-point SIMD MACs, SPADE introduces a regime-aware, lane-fused SIMD Posit datapath that hierarchically reuses Posit-specific submodules (LOD, complementor, shifter, and multiplier) across 8/16/32-bit precisions without datapath replication. FPGA implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-7 shows 45.13% LUT and 80% slice reduction for Posit (8,0), and up to 28.44% and 17.47% improvement for Posit (16,1) and Posit (32,2) over prior work, with only 6.9% LUT and 14.9% register overhead for multi-precision support. ASIC results across TSMC nodes achieve 1.38 GHz at 6.1 mW (28 nm).

Abstract: Recent proposals advocate using keystroke timing signals, specifically the coefficient of variation ($\delta$) of inter-keystroke intervals, to distinguish human-composed text from AI-generated content. We demonstrate that this class of defenses is insecure against two practical attack classes: the copy-type attack, in which a human transcribes LLM-generated text producing authentic motor signals, and timing-forgery attacks, in which automated agents sample inter-keystroke intervals from empirical human distributions. Using 13,000 sessions from the SBU corpus and three timing-forgery variants (histogram sampling, statistical impersonation, and generative LSTM), we show all attacks achieve $\ge$99.8% evasion rates against five classifiers. While detectors achieve AUC=1.000 against fully-automated injection, they classify $\ge$99.8% of attack samples as human with mean confidence $\ge$0.993. We formalize a non-identifiability result: when the detector observes only timing, the mutual information between features and content provenance is zero for copy-type attacks. Although composition and transcription produce statistically distinguishable motor patterns (Cohen's d=1.28), both yield $\delta$ values 2-4x above detection thresholds, rendering the distinction security-irrelevant. These systems confirm a human operated the keyboard, but not whether that human originated the text. Securing provenance requires architectures that bind the writing process to semantic content.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17280v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Boundary Integral Formulation of an Acoustic Boundary Layer Model in 2D</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17283</link><description>arXiv:2601.17283v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models in Medical Question Answering is severely hampered by ambiguous user queries, a significant safety risk that demonstrably reduces answer accuracy in high-stakes healthcare settings. In this paper, we formalize this challenge by linking input ambiguity to aleatoric uncertainty (AU), which is the irreducible uncertainty arising from underspecified input. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct CV-MedBench, the first benchmark designed for studying input ambiguity in Medical QA. Using this benchmark, we analyze AU from a representation engineering perspective, revealing that AU is linearly encoded in LLM's internal activation patterns. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel AU-guided "Clarify-Before-Answer" framework, which incorporates AU-Probe - a lightweight module that detects input ambiguity directly from hidden states. Unlike existing uncertainty estimation methods, AU-Probe requires neither LLM fine-tuning nor multiple forward passes, enabling an efficient mechanism to proactively request user clarification and significantly enhance safety. Extensive experiments across four open LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our QA framework, with an average accuracy improvement of 9.48% over baselines. Our framework provides an efficient and robust solution for safe Medical QA, strengthening the reliability of health-related applications.

Abstract: Connectivity query processing is a fundamental problem in graph processing. Given an undirected graph and two query vertices, the problem aims to identify whether they are connected via a path. Given frequent edge updates in real graph applications, in this paper, we study connectivity query processing in fully dynamic graphs, where edges are frequently inserted or deleted. A recent solution, called D-tree, maintains a spanning tree for each connected component and applies several heuristics to reduce the depth of the tree. To improve efficiency, we propose a new spanning-tree-based solution by maintaining a disjoint-set tree simultaneously. By combining the advantages of two trees, we achieve the constant query time complexity and also significantly improve the theoretical running time in both edge insertion and edge deletion. In addition, we extend our connectivity maintenance algorithms to maintain 2-edge connectivity. Our performance studies on real large datasets show considerable improvement of our algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time Synchronized Interaction Framework for Emotion-Aware Humanoid Robots</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17287</link><description>arXiv:2601.17287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As humanoid robots increasingly introduced into social scene, achieving emotionally synchronized multimodal interaction remains a significant challenges. To facilitate the further adoption and integration of humanoid robots into service roles, we present a real-time framework for NAO robots that synchronizes speech prosody with full-body gestures through three key innovations: (1) A dual-channel emotion engine where large language model (LLM) simultaneously generates context-aware text responses and biomechanically feasible motion descriptors, constrained by a structured joint movement library; (2) Duration-aware dynamic time warping for precise temporal alignment of speech output and kinematic motion keyframes; (3) Closed-loop feasibility verification ensuring gestures adhere to NAO's physical joint limits through real-time adaptation. Evaluations show 21% higher emotional alignment compared to rule-based systems, achieved by coordinating vocal pitch (arousal-driven) with upper-limb kinematics while maintaining lower-body stability. By enabling seamless sensorimotor coordination, this framework advances the deployment of context-aware social robots in dynamic applications such as personalized healthcare, interactive education, and responsive customer service platforms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17287v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fluxamba: Topology-Aware Anisotropic State Space Models for Geological Lineament Segmentation in Multi-Source Remote Sensing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17288</link><description>arXiv:2601.17288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise segmentation of geological linear features, spanning from planetary lineaments to terrestrial fractures, demands capturing long-range dependencies across complex anisotropic topologies. Although State Space Models (SSMs) offer near-linear computational complexity, their dependence on rigid, axis-aligned scanning trajectories induces a fundamental topological mismatch with curvilinear targets, resulting in fragmented context and feature erosion. To bridge this gap, we propose Fluxamba, a lightweight architecture that introduces a topology-aware feature rectification framework. Central to our design is the Structural Flux Block (SFB), which orchestrates an anisotropic information flux by integrating an Anisotropic Structural Gate (ASG) with a Prior-Modulated Flow (PMF). This mechanism decouples feature orientation from spatial location, dynamically gating context aggregation along the target's intrinsic geometry rather than rigid paths. Furthermore, to mitigate serialization-induced noise in low-contrast environments, we incorporate a Hierarchical Spatial Regulator (HSR) for multi-scale semantic alignment and a High-Fidelity Focus Unit (HFFU) to explicitly maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of faint features. Extensive experiments on diverse geological benchmarks (LROC-Lineament, LineaMapper, and GeoCrack) demonstrate that Fluxamba establishes a new state-of-the-art. Notably, on the challenging LROC-Lineament dataset, it achieves an F1-score of 89.22% and mIoU of 89.87%. Achieving a real-time inference speed of over 24 FPS with only 3.4M parameters and 6.3G FLOPs, Fluxamba reduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude compared to heavy-weight baselines, thereby establishing a new Pareto frontier between segmentation fidelity and onboard deployment feasibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17288v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Meta-Ensemble Framework for Efficient and Accurate Deep Learning in Plant Leaf Disease Detection on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17290</link><description>arXiv:2601.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying deep learning models for plant disease detection on edge devices such as IoT sensors, smartphones, and embedded systems is severely constrained by limited computational resources and energy budgets. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Dynamic Meta-Ensemble Framework (DMEF) for high-accuracy plant disease diagnosis under resource constraints. DMEF employs an adaptive weighting mechanism that dynamically combines the predictions of three lightweight convolutional neural networks (MobileNetV2, NASNetMobile, and InceptionV3) by optimizing a trade-off between accuracy improvements (DeltaAcc) and computational efficiency (model size). During training, the ensemble weights are updated iteratively, favoring models exhibiting high performance and low complexity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets for potato and maize diseases demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 99.53% and 96.61%, respectively, surpassing standalone models and static ensembles by 2.1% and 6.3%.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly embedded in regulated and safety-critical software, including clinical research platforms and healthcare information systems. While these features enable natural language search, summarization, and configuration assistance, they introduce risks such as hallucinations, harmful or out-of-scope advice, privacy and security issues, bias, instability under change, and adversarial misuse. Prior work on machine learning testing and AI assurance offers useful concepts but limited guidance for interactive, product-embedded assistants. This paper proposes a risk-based testing framework for LLM features in regulated software: a six-category risk taxonomy, a layered test strategy mapping risks to concrete tests across guardrail, orchestration, and system layers, and a case study applying the approach to a Knowledgebase assistant in a clinical research platform.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17292v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structure-Aware NL-to-SQL for SFC Provisioning via AST-Masking Empowered Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17295</link><description>arXiv:2601.17295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Service Function Chain (SFC) provisioning requires precise orchestration in dynamic and latency-sensitive networks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) improves adaptability but often ignores structured domain knowledge, which limits generalization and interpretability. Large Language Models (LLMs) address this gap by translating natural language (NL) specifications into executable Structured Query Language (SQL) commands for specification-driven SFC management. Conventional fine-tuning, however, can cause syntactic inconsistencies and produce inefficient queries. To overcome this, we introduce Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-Masking, a structure-aware fine-tuning method that uses SQL ASTs to assign weights to key components and enforce syntax-aware learning without adding inference overhead. Experiments show that AST-Masking significantly improves SQL generation accuracy across multiple language models. FLAN-T5 reaches an Execution Accuracy (EA) of 99.6%, while Gemma achieves the largest absolute gain from 7.5% to 72.0%. These results confirm the effectiveness of structure-aware fine-tuning in ensuring syntactically correct and efficient SQL generation for interpretable SFC orchestration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tabular Foundation Models are Strong Graph Anomaly Detectors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17301</link><description>arXiv:2601.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify abnormal nodes that deviate from the majority, has become increasingly important in high-stakes Web domains. However, existing GAD methods follow a "one model per dataset" paradigm, leading to high computational costs, substantial data demands, and poor generalization when transferred to new datasets. This calls for a foundation model that enables a "one-for-all" GAD solution capable of detecting anomalies across diverse graphs without retraining. Yet, achieving this is challenging due to the large structural and feature heterogeneity across domains. In this paper, we propose TFM4GAD, a simple yet effective framework that adapts tabular foundation models (TFMs) for graph anomaly detection. Our key insight is that the core challenges of foundation GAD, handling heterogeneous features, generalizing across domains, and operating with scarce labels, are the exact problems that modern TFMs are designed to solve via synthetic pre-training and powerful in-context learning. The primary challenge thus becomes structural: TFMs are agnostic to graph topology. TFM4GAD bridges this gap by "flattening" the graph, constructing an augmented feature table that enriches raw node features with Laplacian embeddings, local and global structural characteristics, and anomaly-sensitive neighborhood aggregations. This augmented table is processed by a TFM in a fully in-context regime. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with various TFM backbones reveal that TFM4GAD surprisingly achieves significant performance gains over specialized GAD models trained from scratch. Our work offers a new perspective and a practical paradigm for leveraging TFMs as powerful, generalist graph anomaly detectors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17301v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decentralized Multi-Agent Swarms for Autonomous Grid Security in Industrial IoT: A Consensus-based Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17303</link><description>arXiv:2601.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments expand to include tens of thousands of connected devices. The centralization of security monitoring architectures creates serious latency issues that savvy attackers can exploit to compromise an entire manufacturing ecosystem. This paper outlines a new, decentralized multi-agent swarm (DMAS) architecture that includes autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents at each edge gateway, functioning as a distributed digital "immune system" for IIoT networks. Instead of using a traditional static firewall approach, the DMAS agents communicate via a lightweight peer-to-peer protocol to cooperatively detect anomalous behavior across the IIoT network without sending data to a cloud infrastructure. The authors also outline a consensus-based threat validation (CVT) process in which agents vote on the threat level of an identified threat, enabling instant quarantine of a compromised node or nodes. The authors conducted experiments on a testbed that simulated an innovative factory environment with 2000 IIoT devices and found that the DMAS demonstrated sub-millisecond response times (average of 0.85ms), 97.3% accuracy in detecting malicious activity under high load, and 87% accuracy in detecting zero-day attacks. All significantly higher than baseline values for both centralized and edge computing. Additionally, the proposed architecture can prevent real-time cascading failures in industrial control systems and reduce network bandwidth use by 89% compared to cloud-based solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17303v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A New Look at the Ensemble Kalman Filter for Inverse Problems: Duality, Non-Asymptotic Analysis and Convergence Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17305</link><description>arXiv:2601.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents new results and understanding of the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for inverse problems. In particular, using a Lagrangian dual perspective we show that EnKF can be derived from the sample average approximation (SAA) of the Lagrangian dual function. The beauty of this new duality perspective is that it facilitates us to prove and numerically verify a novel non-asymptotic convergence result for the EnKF. Motivated by the new perspective, we also present a new convergence improvement strategy for the Ensemble Kalman Inversion Algorithm (EnKI), which is an iterative version of the EnKF for inverse problems. In particular, we propose an adaptive multiplicative correction to the sample covariance matrix at each iteration and we call this new algorithm as EnKI-MC (I). Based on the new duality perspective, we derive an expression for the optimal correction factor at each iteration of the EnKI algorithm to accelerate the convergence. In addition, we also consider an ensemble specific multiplicative covariance correction strategy (EnKI-MC (II)) where a different correction is employed for each ensemble. By viewing EnKI through the lens of fixed-point iteration, we also provide theoretical results that guarantees the convergence of EnKI-MC (I) algorithm. Numerical investigations for the deconvolution problem, initial condition inversion in advection-convection problem, initial condition inversion in a Lorenz 96 model, and inverse problem constrained by elliptic partial differential equation are conducted to verify the non-asymptotic results for EnKF and to assess the performance of convergence improvement strategies for EnKI. The numerical results suggest that the proposed strategies for EnKI not only led to faster convergence in comparison to the currently employed techniques but also better quality solutions at termination of the algorithm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17305v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Weighted Graph Clustering via Scale Contraction and Graph Structure Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17307</link><description>arXiv:2601.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph clustering aims to partition nodes into distinct clusters based on their similarity, thereby revealing relationships among nodes. Nevertheless, most existing methods do not fully utilize these edge weights. Leveraging edge weights in graph clustering tasks faces two critical challenges. (1) The introduction of edge weights may significantly increase storage space and training time, making it essential to reduce the graph scale while preserving nodes that are beneficial for the clustering task. (2) Edge weight information may inherently contain noise that negatively impacts clustering results. However, few studies can jointly optimize clustering and edge weights, which is crucial for mitigating the negative impact of noisy edges on clustering task. To address these challenges, we propose a contractile edge-weight-aware graph clustering network. Specifically, a cluster-oriented graph contraction module is designed to reduce the graph scale while preserving important nodes. An edge-weight-aware attention network is designed to identify and weaken noisy connections. In this way, we can more easily identify and mitigate the impact of noisy edges during the clustering process, thus enhancing clustering effectiveness. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world weighted graph datasets. In particular, our model outperforms the best baseline, demonstrating its superior performance. Furthermore, experiments also show that the proposed graph contraction module can significantly reduce training time and storage space.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17307v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PAR: Plausibility-aware Amortized Recourse Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17309</link><description>arXiv:2601.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic recourse aims to recommend actionable changes to a factual's attributes that flip an unfavorable model decision while remaining realistic and feasible. We formulate recourse as a Constrained Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) inference problem under the accepted-class data distribution seeking counterfactuals with high likelihood while respecting other recourse constraints. We present PAR, an amortized approximate inference procedure that generates highly likely recourses efficiently. Recourse likelihood is estimated directly using tractable probabilistic models that admit exact likelihood evaluation and efficient gradient propagation that is useful during training. The recourse generator is trained with the objective of maximizing the likelihood under the accepted-class distribution while minimizing the likelihood under the denied-class distribution and other losses that encode recourse constraints. Furthermore, PAR includes a neighborhood-based conditioning mechanism to promote recourse generation that is customized to a factual. We validate PAR on widely used algorithmic recourse datasets and demonstrate its efficiency in generating recourses that are valid, similar to the factual, sparse, and highly plausible, yielding superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17309v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-Fidelity Longitudinal Patient Simulation Using Real-World Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17310</link><description>arXiv:2601.17310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation is a powerful tool for exploring uncertainty. Its potential in clinical medicine is transformative and includes personalized treatment planning and virtual clinical trials. However, simulating patient trajectories is challenging because of complex biological and sociocultural influences. Here, we show that real-world clinical records can be leveraged to empirically model patient timelines. We developed a generative simulator model that takes a patient's history as input and synthesizes fine-grained, realistic future trajectories. The model was pretrained on more than 200 million clinical records. It produced high-fidelity future timelines, closely matching event occurrence rates, laboratory test results, and temporal dynamics in real patient future data. It also accurately estimated future event probabilities, with observed-to-expected ratios consistently near 1.0 across diverse outcomes and time horizons. Our results reveal the untapped value of real-world data in electronic health records and introduce a scalable framework for in silico modeling of clinical care.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17310v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Phase Transition for Budgeted Multi-Agent Synergy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17311</link><description>arXiv:2601.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems can improve reliability, yet under a fixed inference budget they often help, saturate, or even collapse. We develop a minimal and calibratable theory that predicts these regimes from three binding constraints of modern agent stacks: finite context windows, lossy inter-agent communication, and shared failures among similar agents. Each leaf agent is summarized by a compute-performance scaling exponent $\beta$; communication is captured by a message-length fidelity curve $\gamma(m)$; dependence is captured by an effective shared-error correlation $\rho$; and a context window $W$ imposes hard fan-in limits that make hierarchy necessary. For binary success/failure tasks with majority aggregation, we prove a sharp phase transition for deep $b$-ary trees with correlated inputs and lossy communication: a single scalar $\alpha_\rho$ (combining $\gamma(m)$, $\rho$, and fan-in $b$) determines whether weak signal is amplified to a nontrivial fixed point or washed out to chance. In the amplifying regime, we derive an organization exponent $s$ and show that budgeted synergy, i.e., outperforming the best single agent under the same total budget, occurs exactly when $s&gt;\beta$, yielding closed-form compute allocation rules and explicit budget thresholds. We further characterize saturation via a mixing depth and provide a conservative clipped predictor that remains accurate across growth and saturation. A continuous-performance warm-up gives closed-form risks for star, chain, and tree organizations, making correlation- and communication-induced floors explicit and exposing the core design trade-offs in a smooth setting. Finally, we validate the predicted phase boundaries in controlled synthetic simulations and show how the same mechanisms explain the dominant bottlenecks reported in recent large-scale matched-budget studies of LLM agent-system scaling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17311v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Meta-Judging with Large Language Models: Concepts, Methods, and Challenges</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17312</link><description>arXiv:2601.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving fast and are now frequently used as evaluators, in a process typically referred to as LLM-as-a-Judge, which provides quality assessments of model outputs. However, recent research points out significant vulnerabilities in such evaluation, including sensitivity to prompts, systematic biases, verbosity effects, and unreliable or hallucinated rationales. These limitations motivated the development of a more robust paradigm, dubbed LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge. This survey reviews recent advances in meta-judging and organizes the literature, by introducing a framework along six key perspectives: (i) Conceptual Foundations, (ii) Mechanisms of Meta-Judging, (iii) Alignment Training Methods, (iv) Evaluation, (v) Limitations and Failure Modes, and (vi) Future Directions. By analyzing the limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge and summarizing recent advances in meta-judging by LLMs, we argue that LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge offers a promising direction for more stable and trustworthy automated evaluation, while highlighting remaining challenges related to cost, prompt sensitivity, and shared model biases, which must be addressed to advance the next generation of LLM evaluation methodologies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17312v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ClinNet: Evidential Ordinal Regression with Bilateral Asymmetry and Prototype Memory for Knee Osteoarthritis Grading</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17315</link><description>arXiv:2601.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) grading based on radiographic images is a critical yet challenging task due to subtle inter-grade differences, annotation uncertainty, and the inherently ordinal nature of disease progression. Conventional deep learning approaches typically formulate this problem as deterministic multi-class classification, ignoring both the continuous progression of degeneration and the uncertainty in expert annotations. In this work, we propose ClinNet, a novel trustworthy framework that addresses KOA grading as an evidential ordinal regression problem. The proposed method integrates three key components: (1) a Bilateral Asymmetry Encoder (BAE) that explicitly models medial-lateral structural discrepancies; (2) a Diagnostic Memory Bank that maintains class-wise prototypes to stabilize feature representations; and (3) an Evidential Ordinal Head based on the Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) distribution to jointly estimate continuous KL grades and epistemic uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ClinNet achieves a Quadratic Weighted Kappa of 0.892 and Accuracy of 0.768, statistically outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (p &lt; 0.001). Crucially, we demonstrate that the model's uncertainty estimates successfully flag out-of-distribution samples and potential misdiagnoses, paving the way for safe clinical deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17315v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The direct-line method for forward and inverse linear elasticity problems of composite materials in general domains with multiple singularities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17318</link><description>arXiv:2601.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a combined strategy of domain decomposition and the direct-line method is implemented to solve the forward and inverse linear elasticity problems of composite materials in general domains with multiple singularities. Domain decomposition technology treats the general domain as the union of some star-shaped subdomains, which can be handled using the direct-line method. The direct-line method demonstrates rapid convergence of the semi-discrete eigenvalues towards the exact eigenvalues of the elliptic operator, thereby naturally capturing the singularities. We also establish optimal error estimates for the proposed method. Especially, our method can handle multiple singular point problems in general regions, which are difficult to deal with by most methods. On the other hand, the inverse elasticity problem is constructed as a energy functional minimization problem with total variational regularization, we use the aforementioned method as a forward solver to reconstruct the lam\'{e} coefficient of multiple singular points in general regions. Our method can simultaneously deduce heterogeneous $\mu$ and $\lambda$ between different materials. Through numerical experiments on three forward and inverse problems, we systematically verified the accuracy and reliability of this method to solve forward and inverse elastic problems in general domains with multiple singularities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17318v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structural Operational Semantics for True Concurrency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17322</link><description>arXiv:2601.17322v1 Announce Type: new

From SOS to SOS for true concurrency, it is in nature to give the related concepts in SOS a truly concurrent semantics foundation, i.e., a transition occurs by executing a Partially Ordered Multi Set (pomset) of actions replacing just one single action. Under the framework of SOS, for the extension to the truly concurrent one, something are changing: Labelled Transition System (LTS) is generalized to Pomset LTS (PLTS), Transition System Specification (TSS) to Pomset TSS (PTSS), interleaving behavioural equivalences to truly concurrent ones, congruence formats of TSSs to those of PTSSs; something are remained, such as the concept of conservative extension, the meanings of TSSs and PTSSs, higher-order languages and denotational semantics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17322v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SkyReels-V3 Technique Report</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17323</link><description>arXiv:2601.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation serves as a cornerstone for building world models, where multimodal contextual inference stands as the defining test of capability. In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, a conditional video generation model, built upon a unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReels-V3 model supports three core generative paradigms within a single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce high-fidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design a comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copy paste artifacts. During training, an image video hybrid strategy combined with multi-resolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audio-conditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized.
  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems.

Abstract: Retinal prostheses restore limited visual perception, but low spatial resolution and temporal persistence make reading difficult. In sequential letter presentation, the afterimage of one symbol can interfere with perception of the next, leading to systematic recognition errors. Rather than relying on future hardware improvements, we investigate whether optimizing the visual symbols themselves can mitigate this temporal interference. We present SymbolSight, a computational framework that selects symbol-to-letter mappings to minimize confusion among frequently adjacent letters. Using simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) and a neural proxy observer, we estimate pairwise symbol confusability and optimize assignments using language-specific bigram statistics. Across simulations in Arabic, Bulgarian, and English, the resulting heterogeneous symbol sets reduced predicted confusion by a median factor of 22 relative to native alphabets. These results suggest that standard typography is poorly matched to serial, low-bandwidth prosthetic vision and demonstrate how computational modeling can efficiently narrow the design space of visual encodings to generate high-potential candidates for future psychophysical and clinical evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conformal Feedback Alignment: Quantifying Answer-Level Reliability for Robust LLM Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17329</link><description>arXiv:2601.17329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference-based alignment like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) learns from pairwise preferences, yet the labels are often noisy and inconsistent. Existing uncertainty-aware approaches weight preferences, but ignore a more fundamental factor: the reliability of the \emph{answers} being compared. To address the problem, we propose Conformal Feedback Alignment (CFA), a framework that grounds preference weighting in the statistical guarantees of Conformal Prediction (CP). CFA quantifies answer-level reliability by constructing conformal prediction sets with controllable coverage and aggregates these reliabilities into principled weights for both DPO- and PPO-style training. Experiments across different datasets show that CFA improves alignment robustness and data efficiency, highlighting that modeling \emph{answer-side} uncertainty complements preference-level weighting and yields more robust, data-efficient alignment.

Abstract: Modern machine learning relies on a collection of empirically successful but theoretically heterogeneous regularization techniques, such as weight decay, dropout, and exponential moving averages. At the same time, the rapidly increasing energetic cost of training large models raises the question of whether learning algorithms approach any fundamental efficiency bound. In this work, we propose a unifying theoretical framework connecting thermodynamic optimality, information geometry, and regularization.
  Under three explicit assumptions -- (A1) that optimality requires an intrinsic, parametrization-invariant measure of information, (A2) that belief states are modeled by maximum-entropy distributions under known constraints, and (A3) that optimal processes are quasi-static -- we prove a conditional optimality theorem. Specifically, the Fisher--Rao metric is the unique admissible geometry on belief space, and thermodynamically optimal regularization corresponds to minimizing squared Fisher--Rao distance to a reference state.
  We derive the induced geometries for Gaussian and circular belief models, yielding hyperbolic and von Mises manifolds, respectively, and show that classical regularization schemes are structurally incapable of guaranteeing thermodynamic optimality. We introduce a notion of thermodynamic efficiency of learning and propose experimentally testable predictions. This work provides a principled geometric and thermodynamic foundation for regularization in machine learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17330v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning with Geometric Priors in U-Net Variants for Polyp Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17331</link><description>arXiv:2601.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and robust polyp segmentation is essential for early colorectal cancer detection and for computer-aided diagnosis. While convolutional neural network-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based U-Net variants have achieved strong performance, they still struggle to capture geometric and structural cues, especially in low-contrast or cluttered colonoscopy scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Geometric Prior-guided Module (GPM) that injects explicit geometric priors into U-Net-based architectures for polyp segmentation. Specifically, we fine-tune the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) on a simulated ColonDepth dataset to estimate depth maps of polyp images tailored to the endoscopic domain. These depth maps are then processed by GPM to encode geometric priors into the encoder's feature maps, where they are further refined using spatial and channel attention mechanisms that emphasize both local spatial and global channel information. GPM is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into diverse U-Net variants. Extensive experiments on five public polyp segmentation datasets demonstrate consistent gains over three strong baselines.

Abstract: The high cost of agentic workflows in formal mathematics hinders large-scale data synthesis, exacerbating the scarcity of open-source corpora. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TheoremForge}, a cost-effective formal data synthesis pipeline that decomposes the formalization process into five sub-tasks, which are \textit{statement formalization}, \textit{proof generation}, \textit{premise selection}, \textit{proof correction} and \textit{proof sketching}. By implementing a \textit{Decoupled Extraction Strategy}, the workflow recovers valid training signals from globally failed trajectories, effectively utilizing wasted computation. Experiments on a 2,000-problem benchmark demonstrate that TheoremForge achieves a Verified Rate of 12.6\%, surpassing the 8.6\% baseline, at an average cost of only \textbf{\$0.481} per successful trajectory using Gemini-3-Flash. Crucially, our strategy increases data yield by \textbf{1.6$\times$} for proof generation compared to standard filtering.

Abstract: Natural Language Query (NLQ) allows users to search and interact with information systems using plain, human language instead of structured query syntax. This paper presents a technical blueprint on the design of a modern NLQ system tailored to financial knowledge search. The introduction of NLQ not only enhances the precision and recall of the knowledge search compared to traditional methods, but also facilitates deeper insights by efficiently linking disparate financial objects, events, and relationships. Using core constructs from natural language processing, search engineering, and vector data models, the proposed system aims to address key challenges in discovering, relevance ranking, data freshness, and entity recognition intrinsic to financial data retrieval. In this work, we detail the unique requirements of NLQ for financial datasets and documents, outline the architectural components for offline indexing and online retrieval, and discuss the real-world use cases of enhanced knowledge search in financial services. We delve into the theoretical underpinnings and experimental evidence supporting our proposed architecture, ultimately providing a comprehensive analysis on the subject matter. We also provide a detailed elaboration of our experimental methodology, the data used, the results and future optimizations in this study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17333v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Power-based Partial Attention: Bridging Linear-Complexity and Full Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17334</link><description>arXiv:2601.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely accepted from transformer research that "attention is all we need", but the amount of attention required has never been systematically quantified. Is quadratic $O(L^2)$ attention necessary, or is there a sub-quadratic attention mechanism that can achieve comparable performance? To answer this question, we introduce power-based partial attention (PPA), an attention mechanism of order $O(L^{1+p})$, where $0 \leq p \leq 1$, such that $p=0$ corresponds to sliding window attention with linear complexity, and $p=1$ corresponds to full attention. With this attention construction, we can explore how transformer architecture performance varies as a function of the attention scaling behavior controlled by $p$. The overall trend from our experiments shows an S-curve-like behavior where the performance transitions from sliding-window (linear-complexity) attention to full attention over a narrow window of $p$ values, and plateaus as $p$ approaches $1$. In our experiments, we show that there exists $0&lt;p&gt;&lt;1$ such that $O(L^{1+p})$ attention is sufficient to achieve similar results as $O(L^2)$ full attention.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Relativity of AGI: Distributional Axioms, Fragility, and Undecidability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17335</link><description>arXiv:2601.17335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) admits a coherent theoretical definition that supports absolute claims of existence, robustness, or self-verification. We formalize AGI axiomatically as a distributional, resource-bounded semantic predicate, indexed by a task family, a task distribution, a performance functional, and explicit resource budgets. Under this framework, we derive four classes of results. First, we show that generality is inherently relational: there is no distribution-independent notion of AGI. Second, we prove non-invariance results demonstrating that arbitrarily small perturbations of the task distribution can invalidate AGI properties via cliff sets, precluding universal robustness. Third, we establish bounded transfer guarantees, ruling out unbounded generalization across task families under finite resources. Fourth, invoking Rice-style and G\"odel--Tarski arguments, we prove that AGI is a nontrivial semantic property and therefore cannot be soundly and completely certified by any computable procedure, including procedures implemented by the agent itself. Consequently, recursive self-improvement schemes that rely on internal self-certification of AGI are ill-posed. Taken together, our results show that strong, distribution-independent claims of AGI are not false but undefined without explicit formal indexing, and that empirical progress in AI does not imply the attainability of self-certifying general intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17335v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AGE-Net: Spectral--Spatial Fusion and Anatomical Graph Reasoning with Evidential Ordinal Regression for Knee Osteoarthritis Grading</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17336</link><description>arXiv:2601.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Kellgren--Lawrence (KL) grading from knee radiographs is challenging due to subtle structural changes, long-range anatomical dependencies, and ambiguity near grade boundaries. We propose AGE-Net, a ConvNeXt-based framework that integrates Spectral--Spatial Fusion (SSF), Anatomical Graph Reasoning (AGR), and Differential Refinement (DFR). To capture predictive uncertainty and preserve label ordinality, AGE-Net employs a Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) evidential regression head and a pairwise ordinal ranking constraint. On a knee KL dataset, AGE-Net achieves a quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) of 0.9017 +/- 0.0045 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.2349 +/- 0.0028 over three random seeds, outperforming strong CNN baselines and showing consistent gains in ablation studies. We further outline evaluations of uncertainty quality, robustness, and explainability, with additional experimental figures to be included in the full manuscript.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17336v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TEXTS-Diff: TEXTS-Aware Diffusion Model for Real-World Text Image Super-Resolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17340</link><description>arXiv:2601.17340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world text image super-resolution aims to restore overall visual quality and text legibility in images suffering from diverse degradations and text distortions. However, the scarcity of text image data in existing datasets results in poor performance on text regions. In addition, datasets consisting of isolated text samples limit the quality of background reconstruction. To address these limitations, we construct Real-Texts, a large-scale, high-quality dataset collected from real-world images, which covers diverse scenarios and contains natural text instances in both Chinese and English. Additionally, we propose the TEXTS-Aware Diffusion Model (TEXTS-Diff) to achieve high-quality generation in both background and textual regions. This approach leverages abstract concepts to improve the understanding of textual elements within visual scenes and concrete text regions to enhance textual details. It mitigates distortions and hallucination artifacts commonly observed in text regions, while preserving high-quality visual scene fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, exhibiting superior generalization ability and text restoration accuracy in complex scenarios. All the code, model, and dataset will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17340v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] STARS: Shared-specific Translation and Alignment for missing-modality Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17342</link><description>arXiv:2601.17342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing technology significantly enhances the understanding of surface semantics by integrating heterogeneous data such as optical images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and Digital Surface Models (DSM). However, in practical applications, the missing of modality data (e.g., optical or DSM) is a common and severe challenge, which leads to performance decline in traditional multimodal fusion models. Existing methods for addressing missing modalities still face limitations, including feature collapse and overly generalized recovered features. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{STARS} (\textbf{S}hared-specific \textbf{T}ranslation and \textbf{A}lignment for missing-modality \textbf{R}emote \textbf{S}ensing), a robust semantic segmentation framework for incomplete multimodal inputs. STARS is built on two key designs. First, we introduce an asymmetric alignment mechanism with bidirectional translation and stop-gradient, which effectively prevents feature collapse and reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters. Second, we propose a Pixel-level Semantic sampling Alignment (PSA) strategy that combines class-balanced pixel sampling with cross-modality semantic alignment loss, to mitigate alignment failures caused by severe class imbalance and improve minority-class recognition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17342v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are We Evaluating the Edit Locality of LLM Model Editing Properly?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17343</link><description>arXiv:2601.17343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model editing has recently emerged as a popular paradigm for efficiently updating knowledge in LLMs. A central desideratum of updating knowledge is to balance editing efficacy, i.e., the successful injection of target knowledge, and specificity (also known as edit locality), i.e., the preservation of existing non-target knowledge. However, we find that existing specificity evaluation protocols are inadequate for this purpose. We systematically elaborated on the three fundamental issues it faces. Beyond the conceptual issues, we further empirically demonstrate that existing specificity metrics are weakly correlated with the strength of specificity regularizers. We also find that current metrics lack sufficient sensitivity, rendering them ineffective at distinguishing the specificity performance of different methods. Finally, we propose a constructive evaluation protocol. Under this protocol, the conflict between open-ended LLMs and the assumption of determined answers is eliminated, query-independent fluency biases are avoided, and the evaluation strictness can be smoothly adjusted within a near-continuous space. Experiments across various LLMs, datasets, and editing methods show that metrics derived from the proposed protocol are more sensitive to changes in the strength of specificity regularizers and exhibit strong correlation with them, enabling more fine-grained discrimination of different methods' knowledge preservation capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17343v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Shadow Self: Intrinsic Value Misalignment in Large Language Model Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17344</link><description>arXiv:2601.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents with extended autonomy unlock new capabilities, but also introduce heightened challenges for LLM safety. In particular, an LLM agent may pursue objectives that deviate from human values and ethical norms, a risk known as value misalignment. Existing evaluations primarily focus on responses to explicit harmful input or robustness against system failure, while value misalignment in realistic, fully benign, and agentic settings remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we first formalize the Loss-of-Control risk and identify the previously underexamined Intrinsic Value Misalignment (Intrinsic VM). We then introduce IMPRESS (Intrinsic Value Misalignment Probes in REalistic Scenario Set), a scenario-driven framework for systematically assessing this risk. Following our framework, we construct benchmarks composed of realistic, fully benign, and contextualized scenarios, using a multi-stage LLM generation pipeline with rigorous quality control. We evaluate Intrinsic VM on 21 state-of-the-art LLM agents and find that it is a common and broadly observed safety risk across models. Moreover, the misalignment rates vary by motives, risk types, model scales, and architectures. While decoding strategies and hyperparameters exhibit only marginal influence, contextualization and framing mechanisms significantly shape misalignment behaviors. Finally, we conduct human verification to validate our automated judgments and assess existing mitigation strategies, such as safety prompting and guardrails, which show instability or limited effectiveness. We further demonstrate key use cases of IMPRESS across the AI Ecosystem. Our code and benchmark will be publicly released upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17344v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Learning Path Planning via LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17346</link><description>arXiv:2601.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into intelligent tutoring systems offers transformative potential for personalized learning in higher education. However, most existing learning path planning approaches lack transparency, adaptability, and learner-centered explainability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Learning Path Planning (MALPP) framework that leverages a role- and rule-based collaboration mechanism among intelligent agents, each powered by LLMs. The framework includes three task-specific agents: a learner analytics agent, a path planning agent, and a reflection agent. These agents collaborate via structured prompts and predefined rules to analyze learning profiles, generate tailored learning paths, and iteratively refine them with interpretable feedback. Grounded in Cognitive Load Theory and Zone of Proximal Development, the system ensures that recommended paths are cognitively aligned and pedagogically meaningful. Experiments conducted on the MOOCCubeX dataset using seven LLMs show that MALPP significantly outperforms baseline models in path quality, knowledge sequence consistency, and cognitive load alignment. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the collaborative mechanism and theoretical constraints. This research contributes to the development of trustworthy, explainable AI in education and demonstrates a scalable approach to learner-centered adaptive instruction powered by LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Auditing Disability Representation in Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17348</link><description>arXiv:2601.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in socially sensitive applications, yet their behavior with respect to disability remains underexplored. We study disability aware descriptions for person centric images, where models often transition from evidence grounded factual description to interpretation shift including introduction of unsupported inferences beyond observable visual evidence. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a benchmark based on paired Neutral Prompts (NP) and Disability-Contextualised Prompts (DP) and evaluate 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs under a zero-shot setting across 9 disability categories. Our evaluation framework treats interpretive fidelity as core objective and combines standard text-based metrics capturing affective degradation through shifts in sentiment, social regard and response length with an LLM-as-judge protocol, validated by annotators with lived experience of disability. We find that introducing disability context consistently degrades interpretive fidelity, inducing interpretation shifts characterised by speculative inference, narrative elaboration, affective degradation and deficit oriented framing. These effects are further amplified along race and gender dimension. Finally, we demonstrate targeted prompting and preference fine-tuning effectively improves interpretive fidelity and reduces substantially interpretation shifts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17348v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Lightweight Low-Light Image Enhancement: From a YUV Color Space Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17349</link><description>arXiv:2601.17349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current era of mobile internet, Lightweight Low-Light Image Enhancement (L3IE) is critical for mobile devices, which faces a persistent trade-off between visual quality and model compactness. While recent methods employ disentangling strategies to simplify lightweight architectural design, such as Retinex theory and YUV color space transformations, their performance is fundamentally limited by overlooking channel-specific degradation patterns and cross-channel interactions. To address this gap, we perform a frequency-domain analysis that confirms the superiority of the YUV color space for L3IE. We identify a key insight: the Y channel primarily loses low-frequency content, while the UV channels are corrupted by high-frequency noise. Leveraging this finding, we propose a novel YUV-based paradigm that strategically restores channels using a Dual-Stream Global-Local Attention module for the Y channel, a Y-guided Local-Aware Frequency Attention module for the UV channels, and a Guided Interaction module for final feature fusion. Extensive experiments validate that our model establishes a new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks, delivering superior visual quality with a significantly lower parameter count.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17349v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NeRF-MIR: Towards High-Quality Restoration of Masked Images with Neural Radiance Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17350</link><description>arXiv:2601.17350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis. However, there is much improvement room on restoring 3D scenes based on NeRF from corrupted images, which are common in natural scene captures and can significantly impact the effectiveness of NeRF. This paper introduces NeRF-MIR, a novel neural rendering approach specifically proposed for the restoration of masked images, demonstrating the potential of NeRF in this domain. Recognizing that randomly emitting rays to pixels in NeRF may not effectively learn intricate image textures, we propose a \textbf{P}atch-based \textbf{E}ntropy for \textbf{R}ay \textbf{E}mitting (\textbf{PERE}) strategy to distribute emitted rays properly. This enables NeRF-MIR to fuse comprehensive information from images of different views. Additionally, we introduce a \textbf{P}rogressively \textbf{I}terative \textbf{RE}storation (\textbf{PIRE}) mechanism to restore the masked regions in a self-training process. Furthermore, we design a dynamically-weighted loss function that automatically recalibrates the loss weights for masked regions. As existing datasets do not support NeRF-based masked image restoration, we construct three masked datasets to simulate corrupted scenarios. Extensive experiments on real data and constructed datasets demonstrate the superiority of NeRF-MIR over its counterparts in masked image restoration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17350v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-RP: The AI Relationship Process Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17351</link><description>arXiv:2601.17351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a growing number of people, AI chatbots have become close personal companions. Despite rising scholarly attention, theoretical accounts of how such relationships develop remain fragmented. Existing frameworks address important aspects of the phenomenon, but they rarely treat human-chatbot communication as the central behavior that builds relationships. To address this gap, we propose the AI relationship process (AI-RP) framework. The AI-RP outlines relationship formation as a sequential process. (a) Chatbot characteristics shape users' (b) social perceptions. These perceptions guide (c) communication, and communication produces (d) relational outcomes such as attachment and companionship. The AI-RP introduces a six-features profile characterizing chatbots, a dual-route approach of social perception, a behavioral conceptualization of communication and discusses the foundation and types of artificial relationships. By foregrounding observable communicative behavior, the AI-RP provides a foundation for theory building and empirical research on the social and ethical implications of AI companionship.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17351v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HyDeMiC: A Deep Learning-based Mineral Classifier using Hyperspectral Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17352</link><description>arXiv:2601.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has emerged as a powerful remote sensing tool for mineral exploration, capitalizing on unique spectral signatures of minerals. However, traditional classification methods such as discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machines often struggle with environmental noise in data, sensor limitations, and the computational complexity of analyzing high-dimensional HSI data. This study presents HyDeMiC (Hyperspectral Deep Learning-based Mineral Classifier), a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed for robust mineral classification under noisy data. To train HyDeMiC, laboratory-measured hyperspectral data for 115 minerals spanning various mineral groups were used from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) library. The training dataset was generated by convolving reference mineral spectra with an HSI sensor response function. These datasets contained three copper-bearing minerals, Cuprite, Malachite, and Chalcopyrite, used as case studies for performance demonstration. The trained CNN model was evaluated on several synthetic 2D hyperspectral datasets with noise levels of 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%. Our noisy data analysis aims to replicate realistic field conditions. The HyDeMiC's performance was assessed using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), providing a comprehensive measure across different noise regimes. Results demonstrate that HyDeMiC achieved near-perfect classification accuracy (MCC = 1.00) on clean and low-noise datasets and maintained strong performance under moderate noise conditions. These findings emphasize HyDeMiC's robustness in the presence of moderate noise, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in hyperspectral imaging, where noise is often a significant challenge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Scores to Queues: Operationalizing Cross-Chain Obfuscation Signals for Smart-Contract Audits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17356</link><description>arXiv:2601.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obfuscation substantially increases the interpretation cost of smart-contract auditing, while the comparability and transferability of obfuscation signals across chains remain unclear. We present HObfNET as an efficient surrogate of Obfs_Tool (ObfProbe), enabling fast cross-chain scoring at scale. The model aligns well with tool outputs on Ethereum (PCC 0.9158, MAPE 8.20 percent) and achieves 8-9 ms per contract, a 2.3k-5.2k times speedup over second-level Obfs_Tool runs, enabling million-scale scoring. On large BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche corpora, we find systematic score drift: fixed-threshold transfer inflates and deflates candidate queues, motivating within-chain main and extreme thresholds (p99 and p99.9) and an actionable queueing strategy. The high-score tail exhibits rare selectors, external-call opcode enrichment, and low signature density; a proxy indicator is enriched in the BSC high-score queue, enabling secondary triage. Cross-chain reuse analysis shows tail enrichment and directional diffusion, with traceable same-hash cases across chains. In publicly alignable incident samples, all fall into the p99 queue; Transit Swap DEX Hack and New Free DAO Flash Loan exhibit cross-chain spillover, indicating real-world hit and prioritization value. We deliver a two-tier audit queue and cross-chain linkage workflow to support practical multi-chain security operations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17356v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spectral Geometry for Deep Learning: Compression and Hallucination Detection via Random Matrix Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17357</link><description>arXiv:2601.17357v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The traditional use-case of query performance prediction (QPP) is to identify which queries perform well and which perform poorly for a given ranking model. A more fine-grained and arguably more challenging extension of this task is to determine which ranking models are most effective for a given query. In this work, we generalize the QPP task and its evaluation into three settings: (i) SingleRanker MultiQuery (SRMQ-PP), corresponding to the standard use case; (ii) MultiRanker SingleQuery (MRSQ-PP), which evaluates a QPP model's ability to select the most effective ranker for a query; and (iii) MultiRanker MultiQuery (MRMQ-PP), which considers predictions jointly across all query ranker pairs. Our results show that (a) the relative effectiveness of QPP models varies substantially across tasks (SRMQ-PP vs. MRSQ-PP), and (b) predicting the best ranker for a query is considerably more difficult than predicting the relative difficulty of queries for a given ranker.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do readers prefer AI-generated Italian short stories?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17363</link><description>arXiv:2601.17363v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: This study uses Jordanian law as a case study to explore the fine-tuning of the Llama-3.1 large language model for Arabic question-answering. Two versions of the model - Llama-3.1-8B-bnb-4bit and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-bnb-4bit - were fine-tuned using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with LoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models, leveraging the Unsloth framework for accelerated and resource-efficient training. A custom dataset of 6000 legal question-answer pairs was curated from Jordanian laws and formatted into structured prompts. Performance was evaluated using the BLEU and the ROUGE metrics to compare the fine-tuned models to their respective base versions. Results demonstrated improved legal reasoning and accuracy while achieving resource efficiency through quantization and optimized fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Existing displacement strategies in semi-supervised segmentation only operate on rectangular regions, ignoring anatomical structures and resulting in boundary distortions and semantic inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose UCAD, an Uncertainty-Guided Contour-Aware Displacement framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation that preserves contour-aware semantics while enhancing consistency learning. Our UCAD leverages superpixels to generate anatomically coherent regions aligned with anatomy boundaries, and an uncertainty-guided selection mechanism to selectively displace challenging regions for better consistency learning. We further propose a dynamic uncertainty-weighted consistency loss, which adaptively stabilizes training and effectively regularizes the model on unlabeled regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods, achieving superior segmentation accuracy under limited annotation.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms poses a significant scalability bottleneck for large language models (LLMs) in long-context scenarios. While hybrid attention strategies that combine sparse and full attention within a single model offer a viable solution, they typically employ static computation ratios (i.e., fixed proportions of sparse versus full attention) and fail to adapt to the varying sparsity sensitivities of downstream tasks during inference. To address this issue, we propose Elastic Attention, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its overall sparsity based on the input. This is achieved by integrating a lightweight Attention Router into the existing pretrained model, which dynamically assigns each attention head to different computation modes. Within only 12 hours of training on 8xA800 GPUs, our method enables models to achieve both strong performance and efficient inference. Experiments across three long-context benchmarks on widely-used LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17367v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Scoping Review and Guidelines on Privacy Policy's Visualization from an HCI Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17368</link><description>arXiv:2601.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy Policies are a cornerstone of informed consent, yet a persistent gap exists between their legal intent and practical efficacy. Despite decades of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research proposing various visualizations, user comprehension remains low, and designs rarely see widespread adoption. To understand this landscape and chart a path forward, we synthesized 65 top-tier papers using a framework adapted from the user-centered design lifecycle. Our analysis presented findings of the field's evolution across four dimensions: (1) the trade-off between information load and decision efficacy, which demonstrates a shift from augmenting disclosures to prioritizing information condensation and cognitive load management to counter the inefficacy of comprehensive texts, (2) the co-evolutionary dynamic of design and automation, revealing that complex design ambitions such as context-awareness drove the need for advanced NLP, while recent LLM breakthroughs are enabling the semantic interpretation required to realize those designs, (3) the tension between generality and specificity, highlighting the divergence between standardized, cross-platform solutions and the increasing necessity for specialized, context-aware interaction patterns in IoT and immersive environments, and (4) balancing stakeholder opinions, which shows that visualization efficacy is constrained by the complex interplay of regulatory mandates, developer capabilities and provider incentives. We conclude by outlining four critical challenges for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17368v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Collab: Fostering Critical Identification of Deepfake Videos on Social Media via Synergistic Annotation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17371</link><description>arXiv:2601.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying deepfake videos on social media platforms is challenged by dynamic spatio-temporal artifacts and inadequate user tools. This hinders both critical viewing by users and scalable moderation on platforms. Here, we present Collab, a web plugin enabling users to collaboratively annotate deepfake videos. Collab integrates three key components: (i) an intuitive interface for spatio-temporal labeling where users provide confidence scores and rationales, facilitating detailed input even from non-experts, (ii) a novel confidence-weighted spatio-temporal Intersection-over-Union (IoU) algorithm to aggregate diverse user annotations into accurate aggregations, and (iii) a hierarchical demonstration strategy presenting aggregated results to guide attention toward contentious regions and foster critical evaluation. A seven-day online study (N=90), where participants annotated suspicious videos when viewing an online experimental platforms, compared Collab against two conditions without aggregation or demonstration respectively. Collab significantly improved identification accuracy and enhanced reflection compared to non-demonstration condition, while outperforming non-aggregation condition for its novelty and effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17371v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Operator splitting based diffusion samplers and improved convergence analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17375</link><description>arXiv:2601.17375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a class of samplers for the diffusion model using the operator-splitting technique. The linear drift term and the nonlinear score-driven drift of the probability flow ordinary differential equation are split and applied by flow maps alternatively. Moreover, we conduct detailed analyses for the second-order sampler, establishing a non-asymptotic total variation distance error bound of order $O(d/T^2+\sqrt{d}\varepsilon_{\mathrm{score}}+d\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Jac}})$, where $d$ is the data dimension; $T$ is the number of sampling steps; $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{score}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Jac}}$ measure the discrepancy between the actual score function and learned score function. Our bound is sharper than existing works, yielding bounds of $O(d^p/T^2)$ with some $p&gt;1$ for specific second-order samplers. Numerical experiments on a two-dimensional synthetic dataset corroborate the established quadratic dependence on the step size $1/T$ in the error bound.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17375v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diversified Scaling Inference in Time Series Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17376</link><description>arXiv:2601.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has been driven primarily by large-scale pre-training, but inference-time compute potential remains largely untapped. This work systematically investigates two questions: how do TSFMs behave under standard sampling-based inference scaling, and can controlled sampling diversity enhance performance? We first examine the properties of TSFMs under standard sampling often fail to adhere to scaling laws due to insufficient exploration of the solution space. Building on this, we then delve into diversified inference scaling via tailored time series perturbations to expand the generative distribution's support. We theoretically analyze the diversity-fidelity trade-off and derive a critical sample threshold for diversified sampling to outperform standard sampling. Extensive experiments across various TSFMs and datasets show proper diversified inference scaling yields substantial performance gains without parameter updates, establishing inference design as a critical, compute-efficient dimension of TSFM optimization. As an application, we propose RobustMSE, a rigorous metric to quantify the headroom performance of TSFM under a fixed budget. Overall, our findings clarify these factor interactions, enabling reliable performance via diverse large-scale inference time series in parallel environments without re-training TSFMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17376v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WarrantScore: Modeling Warrants between Claims and Evidence for Substantiation Evaluation in Peer Reviews</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17377</link><description>arXiv:2601.17377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scientific peer-review process is facing a shortage of human resources due to the rapid growth in the number of submitted papers. The use of language models to reduce the human cost of peer review has been actively explored as a potential solution to this challenge. A method has been proposed to evaluate the level of substantiation in scientific reviews in a manner that is interpretable by humans. This method extracts the core components of an argument, claims and evidence, and assesses the level of substantiation based on the proportion of claims supported by evidence. The level of substantiation refers to the extent to which claims are based on objective facts. However, when assessing the level of substantiation, simply detecting the presence or absence of supporting evidence for a claim is insufficient; it is also necessary to accurately assess the logical inference between a claim and its evidence. We propose a new evaluation metric for scientific review comments that assesses the logical inference between claims and evidence. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a higher correlation with human scores than conventional methods, indicating its potential to better support the efficiency of the peer-review process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17377v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Res-MIA: A Training-Free Resolution-Based Membership Inference Attack on Federated Learning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17378</link><description>arXiv:2601.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a serious threat to the privacy of machine learning models by allowing adversaries to determine whether a specific data sample was included in the training set. Although federated learning (FL) is widely regarded as a privacy-aware training paradigm due to its decentralized nature, recent evidence shows that the final global model can still leak sensitive membership information through black-box access. In this paper, we introduce Res-MIA, a novel training-free and black-box membership inference attack that exploits the sensitivity of deep models to high-frequency input details. Res-MIA progressively degrades the input resolution using controlled downsampling and restoration operations, and analyzes the resulting confidence decay in the model's predictions. Our key insight is that training samples exhibit a significantly steeper confidence decline under resolution erosion compared to non-member samples, revealing a robust membership signal. Res-MIA requires no shadow models, no auxiliary data, and only a limited number of forward queries to the target model. We evaluate the proposed attack on a federated ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10, where it consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines and achieves an AUC of up to 0.88 with minimal computational overhead. These findings highlight frequency-sensitive overfitting as an important and previously underexplored source of privacy leakage in federated learning, and emphasize the need for privacy-aware model designs that reduce reliance on fine-grained, non-robust input features.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17378v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prompt and Circumstances: Evaluating the Efficacy of Human Prompt Inference in AI-Generated Art</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17379</link><description>arXiv:2601.17379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of AI-generated art has witnessed the rise of prompt marketplaces, where creators can purchase, sell, or share prompts to generate unique artworks. These marketplaces often assert ownership over prompts, claiming them as intellectual property. This paper investigates whether concealed prompts sold on prompt marketplaces can be considered bona fide intellectual property, given that humans and AI tools may be able to infer the prompts based on publicly advertised sample images accompanying each prompt on sale. Specifically, our study aims to assess (i) how accurately humans can infer the original prompt solely by examining an AI-generated image, with the goal of generating images similar to the original image, and (ii) the possibility of improving upon individual human and AI prompt inferences by crafting combined human and AI prompts with the help of a large language model. Although previous research has explored AI-driven prompt inference and protection strategies, our work is the first to incorporate a human subject study and examine collaborative human-AI prompt inference in depth. Our findings indicate that while prompts inferred by humans and prompts inferred through a combined human and AI effort can generate images with a moderate level of similarity, they are not as successful as using the original prompt. Moreover, combining human- and AI-inferred prompts using our suggested merging techniques did not improve performance over purely human-inferred prompts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17379v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physical Prompt Injection Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17383</link><description>arXiv:2601.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world intelligent systems for perception and reasoning in open physical environments. While LVLMs are known to be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, existing methods either require access to input channels or depend on knowledge of user queries, assumptions that rarely hold in practical deployments. We propose the first Physical Prompt Injection Attack (PPIA), a black-box, query-agnostic attack that embeds malicious typographic instructions into physical objects perceivable by the LVLM. PPIA requires no access to the model, its inputs, or internal pipeline, and operates solely through visual observation. It combines offline selection of highly recognizable and semantically effective visual prompts with strategic environment-aware placement guided by spatiotemporal attention, ensuring that the injected prompts are both perceivable and influential on model behavior. We evaluate PPIA across 10 state-of-the-art LVLMs in both simulated and real-world settings on tasks including visual question answering, planning, and navigation, PPIA achieves attack success rates up to 98%, with strong robustness under varying physical conditions such as distance, viewpoint, and illumination.

Abstract: Multilingual speech-text foundation models aim to process language uniformly across both modality and language, yet it remains unclear whether they internally represent the same language consistently when it is spoken versus written. We investigate this question in SeamlessM4T v2 through three complementary analyses that probe where language and modality information is encoded, how selective neurons causally influence decoding, and how concentrated this influence is across the network. We identify language- and modality-selective neurons using average-precision ranking, investigate their functional role via median-replacement interventions at inference time, and analyze activation-magnitude inequality across languages and modalities. Across experiments, we find evidence of incomplete modality invariance. Although encoder representations become increasingly language-agnostic, this compression makes it more difficult for the shared decoder to recover the language of origin when constructing modality-agnostic representations, particularly when adapting from speech to text. We further observe sharply localized modality-selective structure in cross-attention key and value projections. Finally, speech-conditioned decoding and non-dominant scripts exhibit higher activation concentration, indicating heavier reliance on a small subset of neurons, which may underlie increased brittleness across modalities and languages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17387v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ONRW: Optimizing inversion noise for high-quality and robust watermark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17388</link><description>arXiv:2601.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking methods have always been effective means of protecting intellectual property, yet they face significant challenges. Although existing deep learning-based watermarking systems can hide watermarks in images with minimal impact on image quality, they often lack robustness when encountering image corruptions during transmission, which undermines their practical application value. To this end, we propose a high-quality and robust watermark framework based on the diffusion model. Our method first converts the clean image into inversion noise through a null-text optimization process, and after optimizing the inversion noise in the latent space, it produces a high-quality watermarked image through an iterative denoising process of the diffusion model. The iterative denoising process serves as a powerful purification mechanism, ensuring both the visual quality of the watermarked image and enhancing the robustness of the watermark against various corruptions. To prevent the optimizing of inversion noise from distorting the original semantics of the image, we specifically introduced self-attention constraints and pseudo-mask strategies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against various image corruptions. In particular, our method outperforms the stable signature method by an average of 10\% across 12 different image transformations on COCO datasets.

Abstract: Modern enterprises increasingly adopt diverse technology stacks with various programming languages, posing significant challenges for static application security testing (SAST). Existing taint analysis tools are predominantly designed for single languages, requiring substantial engineering effort that scales with language diversity. While multi-language tools like CodeQL, Joern, and WALA attempt to address these challenges, they face limitations in intermediate representation design, analysis precision, and extensibility, which make them difficult to scale effectively for large-scale industrial applications at Ant Group. To bridge this gap, we present YASA (Yet Another Static Analyzer), a unified multi-language static taint analysis framework designed for industrial-scale deployment. Specifically, YASA introduces the Unified Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST) that provides a unified abstraction for compatibility across diverse programming languages. Building on the UAST, YASA performs point-to analysis and taint propagation, leveraging a unified semantic model to manage language-agnostic constructs, while incorporating language-specific semantic models to handle other unique language features. When compared to 6 single- and 2 multi-language static analyzers on an industry-standard benchmark, YASA consistently outperformed all baselines across Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go. In real-world deployment within Ant Group, YASA analyzed over 100 million lines of code across 7.3K internal applications. It identified 314 previously unknown taint paths, with 92 of them confirmed as 0-day vulnerabilities. All vulnerabilities were responsibly reported, with 76 already patched by internal development teams, demonstrating YASA's practical effectiveness for securing large-scale industrial software systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17390v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SMV-EAR: Bring Spatiotemporal Multi-View Representation Learning into Efficient Event-Based Action Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17391</link><description>arXiv:2601.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras action recognition (EAR) offers compelling privacy-protecting and efficiency advantages, where temporal motion dynamics is of great importance. Existing spatiotemporal multi-view representation learning (SMVRL) methods for event-based object recognition (EOR) offer promising solutions by projecting H-W-T events along spatial axis H and W, yet are limited by its translation-variant spatial binning representation and naive early concatenation fusion architecture. This paper reexamines the key SMVRL design stages for EAR and propose: (i) a principled spatiotemporal multi-view representation through translation-invariant dense conversion of sparse events, (ii) a dual-branch, dynamic fusion architecture that models sample-wise complementarity between motion features from different views, and (iii) a bio-inspired temporal warping augmentation that mimics speed variability of real-world human actions. On three challenging EAR datasets of HARDVS, DailyDVS-200 and THU-EACT-50-CHL, we show +7.0%, +10.7%, and +10.2% Top-1 accuracy gains over existing SMVRL EOR method with surprising 30.1% reduced parameters and 35.7% lower computations, establishing our framework as a novel and powerful EAR paradigm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17391v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GO-OSC and VASH: Geometry-Aware Representation Learning for Early Degradation Detection in Oscillatory Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17396</link><description>arXiv:2601.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-stage degradation in oscillatory systems often manifests as geometric distortions of the dynamics, such as phase jitter, frequency drift, or loss of coherence, long before changes in signal energy are detectable. In this regime, classical energy-based diagnostics and unconstrained learned representations are structurally insensitive, leading to delayed or unstable detection. We introduce GO-OSC, a geometry-aware representation learning framework for oscillatory time series that enforces a canonical and identifiable latent parameterization, enabling stable comparison and aggregation across short, unlabeled windows. Building on this representation, we define a family of invariant linear geometric probes that target degradation-relevant directions in latent space. We provide theoretical results showing that under early phase-only degradation, energy-based statistics have zero first-order detection power, whereas geometric probes achieve strictly positive sensitivity. Our analysis characterizes when and why linear probing fails under non-identifiable representations and shows how canonicalization restores statistical detectability. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real vibration datasets validate the theory, demonstrating earlier detection, improved data efficiency, and robustness to operating condition changes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17396v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CLM-Bench: Benchmarking and Analyzing Cross-lingual Misalignment of LLMs in Knowledge Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17397</link><description>arXiv:2601.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for updating facts in Large Language Models (LLMs) without retraining. However, progress in Multilingual Knowledge Editing (MKE) is currently hindered by biased evaluation frameworks. We observe that existing MKE benchmarks are typically constructed by mechanically translating English-centric datasets into target languages (e.g., English-to-Chinese). This approach introduces translation artifacts and neglects culturally specific entities native to the target language, failing to reflect the true knowledge distribution of LLMs. To address this, we propose CLM-Bench, a culture-aware benchmark constructed using a native Chinese-first methodology. We curate 1,010 high-quality CounterFact pairs rooted in Chinese cultural contexts and align them with English counterparts. Using CLM-Bench, we conduct extensive experiments on representative LLMs (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen2) and reveal a significant Cross-lingual Misalignment: edits in one language function independently and fail to propagate to the other. We further provide a geometric explanation via layer-wise representation analysis, demonstrating that edit vectors for Chinese and English are nearly orthogonal -- residing in disjoint subspaces -- while mixed-lingual editing exhibits linear additivity of these vectors. Our findings challenge the effectiveness of current methods in cross-lingual transfer and underscore the importance of culturally native benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17397v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReLE: A Scalable System and Structured Benchmark for Diagnosing Capability Anisotropy in Chinese LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17399</link><description>arXiv:2601.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved rapid progress in Chinese language understanding, yet accurately evaluating their capabilities remains challenged by benchmark saturation and prohibitive computational costs. While static leaderboards provide snapshot rankings, they often mask the structural trade-offs between capabilities. In this work, we present ReLE (Robust Efficient Live Evaluation), a scalable system designed to diagnose Capability Anisotropy, the non-uniformity of model performance across domains. Using ReLE, we evaluate 304 models (189 commercial, 115 open-source) across a Domain $\times$ Capability orthogonal matrix comprising 207,843 samples. We introduce two methodological contributions to address current evaluation pitfalls: (1) A Symbolic-Grounded Hybrid Scoring Mechanism that eliminates embedding-based false positives in reasoning tasks; (2) A Dynamic Variance-Aware Scheduler based on Neyman allocation with noise correction, which reduces compute costs by 70\% compared to full-pass evaluations while maintaining a ranking correlation of $\rho=0.96$. Our analysis reveals that aggregate rankings are highly sensitive to weighting schemes: models exhibit a Rank Stability Amplitude (RSA) of 11.4 in ReLE versus $\sim$5.0 in traditional benchmarks, confirming that modern models are highly specialized rather than generally superior. We position ReLE not as a replacement for comprehensive static benchmarks, but as a high-frequency diagnostic monitor for the evolving model landscape.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17399v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Eye-Tracking-Driven Control in Daily Task Assistance for Assistive Robotic Arms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17404</link><description>arXiv:2601.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared control improves Human-Robot Interaction by reducing the user's workload and increasing the robot's autonomy. It allows robots to perform tasks under the user's supervision. Current eye-tracking-driven approaches face several challenges. These include accuracy issues in 3D gaze estimation and difficulty interpreting gaze when differentiating between multiple tasks. We present an eye-tracking-driven control framework, aimed at enabling individuals with severe physical disabilities to perform daily tasks independently. Our system uses task pictograms as fiducial markers combined with a feature matching approach that transmits data of the selected object to accomplish necessary task related measurements with an eye-in-hand configuration. This eye-tracking control does not require knowledge of the user's position in relation to the object. The framework correctly interpreted object and task selection in up to 97.9% of measurements. Issues were found in the evaluation, that were improved and shared as lessons learned. The open-source framework can be adapted to new tasks and objects due to the integration of state-of-the-art object detection models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17404v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HAAF: Hierarchical Adaptation and Alignment of Foundation Models for Few-Shot Pathology Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17405</link><description>arXiv:2601.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision pathology relies on detecting fine-grained morphological abnormalities within specific Regions of Interest (ROIs), as these local, texture-rich cues - rather than global slide contexts - drive expert diagnostic reasoning. While Vision-Language (V-L) models promise data efficiency by leveraging semantic priors, adapting them faces a critical Granularity Mismatch, where generic representations fail to resolve such subtle defects. Current adaptation methods often treat modalities as independent streams, failing to ground semantic prompts in ROI-specific visual contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptation and Alignment Framework (HAAF). At its core is a novel Cross-Level Scaled Alignment (CLSA) mechanism that enforces a sequential calibration order: visual features first inject context into text prompts to generate content-adaptive descriptors, which then spatially guide the visual encoder to spotlight anomalies. Additionally, a dual-branch inference strategy integrates semantic scores with geometric prototypes to ensure stability in few-shot settings. Experiments on four benchmarks show HAAF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and effectively scales with domain-specific backbones (e.g., CONCH) in low-resource scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17405v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fingerprinting AI Coding Agents on GitHub</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17406</link><description>arXiv:2601.17406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI coding agents are reshaping software development through both autonomous and human-mediated pull requests (PRs). When developers use AI agents to generate code under their own accounts, code authorship attribution becomes critical for repository governance, research validity, and understanding modern development practices. We present the first study on fingerprinting AI coding agents, analyzing 33,580 PRs from five major agents (OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Devin, Cursor, Claude Code) to identify behavioral signatures. With 41 features spanning commit messages, PR structure, and code characteristics, we achieve 97.2% F1-score in multi-class agent identification. We uncover distinct fingerprints: Codex shows unique multiline commit patterns (67.5% feature importance), and Claude Code exhibits distinctive code structure (27.2% importance of conditional statements). These signatures reveal that AI coding tools produce detectable behavioral patterns, suggesting potential for identifying AI contributions in software repositories.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17406v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Dilated Squeeze and Excitation Neural Operator for Differential Equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17407</link><description>arXiv:2601.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate surrogates for physics-driven partial differential equations (PDEs) are essential in fields such as aerodynamics, porous media design, and flow control. However, many transformer-based models and existing neural operators remain parameter-heavy, resulting in costly training and sluggish deployment. We propose D-SENO (Dilated Squeeze-Excitation Neural Operator), a lightweight operator learning framework for efficiently solving a wide range of PDEs, including airfoil potential flow, Darcy flow in porous media, pipe Poiseuille flow, and incompressible Navier Stokes vortical fields. D-SENO combines dilated convolution (DC) blocks with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) modules to jointly capture wide receptive fields and dynamics alongside channel-wise attention, enabling both accurate and efficient PDE inference. Carefully chosen dilation rates allow the receptive field to focus on critical regions, effectively modeling long-range physical dependencies. Meanwhile, the SE modules adaptively recalibrate feature channels to emphasize dynamically relevant scales. Our model achieves training speed of up to approximately $20\times$ faster than standard transformer-based models and neural operators, while also surpassing (or matching) them in accuracy across multiple PDE benchmarks. Ablation studies show that removing the SE modules leads to a slight drop in performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Source-Free Domain Adaptation by Optimizing Batch-Wise Cosine Similarity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17408</link><description>arXiv:2601.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is an emerging area of research that aims to adapt a model trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without accessing the source data. Most of the successful methods in this area rely on the concept of neighborhood consistency but are prone to errors due to misleading neighborhood information. In this paper, we explore this approach from the point of view of learning more informative clusters and mitigating the effect of noisy neighbors using a concept called neighborhood signature, and demonstrate that adaptation can be achieved using just a single loss term tailored to optimize the similarity and dissimilarity of predictions of samples in the target domain. In particular, our proposed method outperforms existing methods in the challenging VisDA dataset while also yielding competitive results on other benchmark datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17408v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiffusionCinema: Text-to-Aerial Cinematography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17412</link><description>arXiv:2601.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) assisted creative capture system that leverages diffusion models to interpret high-level natural language prompts and automatically generate optimal flight trajectories for cinematic video recording. Instead of manually piloting the drone, the user simply describes the desired shot (e.g., "orbit around me slowly from the right and reveal the background waterfall"). Our system encodes the prompt along with an initial visual snapshot from the onboard camera, and a diffusion model samples plausible spatio-temporal motion plans that satisfy both the scene geometry and shot semantics. The generated flight trajectory is then executed autonomously by the UAV to record smooth, repeatable video clips that match the prompt. User evaluation using NASA-TLX showed a significantly lower overall workload with our interface (M = 21.6) compared to a traditional remote controller (M = 58.1), demonstrating a substantial reduction in perceived effort. Mental demand (M = 11.5 vs. 60.5) and frustration (M = 14.0 vs. 54.5) were also markedly lower for our system, confirming clear usability advantages in autonomous text-driven flight control. This project demonstrates a new interaction paradigm: text-to-cinema flight, where diffusion models act as the "creative operator" converting story intentions directly into aerial motion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17412v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When AI Agents Touch CI/CD Configurations: Frequency and Success</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17413</link><description>arXiv:2601.17413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in software development, yet their interaction with CI/CD configurations is not well studied. We analyze 8,031 agentic pull requests (PRs) from 1,605 GitHub repositories where AI agents touch YAML configurations. CI/CD configuration files account for 3.25% of agent changes, varying by agent (Devin: 4.83%, Codex: 2.01%, p &lt; 0.001). When agents modify CI/CD, 96.77% target GitHub Actions. Agentic PRs with CI/CD changes merge slightly less often than others (67.77% vs. 71.80%), except for Copilot, whose CI/CD changes merge 15.63 percentage points more often. Across 99,930 workflow runs, build success rates are comparable for CI/CD and non-CI/CD changes (75.59% vs. 74.87%), though three agents show significantly higher success when modifying CI/CD. These results show that AI agents rarely modify CI/CD and focus mostly on GitHub Actions, yet their configuration changes are as reliable as regular code. Copilot's strong CI/CD performance despite lower acceptance suggests emerging configuration specialization, with implications for agent training and DevOps automation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17413v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cloud-Enabled IoT System for Real-Time Environmental Monitoring and Remote Device Control Using Firebase</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17414</link><description>arXiv:2601.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has created unprecedented opportunities for remote monitoring and control applications across various domains. Traditional monitoring systems often suffer from limitations in real-time data accessibility, remote controllability, and cloud integration. This paper presents a cloud-enabled IoT system that leverages Google's Firebase Realtime Database for synchronized environmental monitoring and device control. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to interface with a DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, while enabling remote control of two LED indicators through a cloud-based interface. Real-time sensor data is transmitted to Firebase, providing a synchronized platform accessible from multiple devices simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate reliable data transmission with 99.2\% success rate, real-time control latency under 1.5 seconds, and persistent data storage for historical analysis. The system architecture offers a scalable framework for various IoT applications, from smart home automation to industrial monitoring, with a total implementation cost of \$32.50. The integration of Firebase provides robust cloud capabilities without requiring complex server infrastructure, making advanced IoT applications accessible to developers and researchers with limited resources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17414v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Using psychological theory to ground guidelines for the annotation of misogynistic language</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17417</link><description>arXiv:2601.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting misogynistic hate speech is a difficult algorithmic task. The task is made more difficult when decision criteria for what constitutes misogynistic speech are ungrounded in established literatures in psychology and philosophy, both of which have described in great detail the forms explicit and subtle misogynistic attitudes can take. In particular, the literature on algorithmic detection of misogynistic speech often rely on guidelines that are insufficiently robust or inappropriately justified -- they often fail to include various misogynistic phenomena or misrepresent their importance when they do. As a result, current misogyny detection coding schemes and datasets fail to capture the ways women experience misogyny online. This is of pressing importance: misogyny is on the rise both online and offline. Thus, the scientific community needs to have a systematic, theory informed coding scheme of misogyny detection and a corresponding dataset to train and test models of misogyny detection. To this end, we developed (1) a misogyny annotation guideline scheme informed by theoretical and empirical psychological research, (2) annotated a new dataset achieving substantial inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.68) and (3) present a case study using Large Language Models (LLMs) to compare our coding scheme to a self-described "expert" misogyny annotation scheme in the literature. Our findings indicate that our guideline scheme surpasses the other coding scheme in the classification of misogynistic texts across 3 datasets. Additionally, we find that LLMs struggle to replicate our human annotator labels, attributable in large part to how LLMs reflect mainstream views of misogyny. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs for the purposes of misogyny detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17417v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GraphPilot: GUI Task Automation with One-Step LLM Reasoning Powered by Knowledge Graph</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17418</link><description>arXiv:2601.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile graphical user interface (GUI) agents are designed to automate everyday tasks on smartphones. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of mobile GUI agents. However, most LLM-powered mobile GUI agents operate in stepwise query-act loops, which incur high latency due to repeated LLM queries. We present GraphPilot, a mobile GUI agent that leverages knowledge graphs of the target apps to complete user tasks in almost one LLM query. GraphPilot operates in two complementary phases to enable efficient and reliable LLM-powered GUI task automation. In the offline phase, it explores target apps, records and analyzes interaction history, and constructs an app-specific knowledge graph that encodes functions of pages and elements as well as transition rules for each app. In the online phase, given an app and a user task, it leverages the knowledge graph of the given app to guide the reasoning process of LLM. When the reasoning process encounters uncertainty, GraphPilot dynamically requests the HTML representation of the current interface to refine subsequent reasoning. Finally, a validator checks the generated sequence of actions against the transition rules in the knowledge graph, performing iterative corrections to ensure it is valid. The structured, informative information in the knowledge graph allows the LLM to plan the complete sequence of actions required to complete the user task. On the DroidTask benchmark, GraphPilot improves task completion rate over Mind2Web and AutoDroid, while substantially reducing latency and the number of LLM queries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17418v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoT-Seg: Rethinking Segmentation with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Self-Correction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17420</link><description>arXiv:2601.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing works of reasoning segmentation often fall short in complex cases, particularly when addressing complicated queries and out-of-domain images. Inspired by the chain-of-thought reasoning, where harder problems require longer thinking steps/time, this paper aims to explore a system that can think step-by-step, look up information if needed, generate results, self-evaluate its own results, and refine the results, in the same way humans approach harder questions. We introduce CoT-Seg, a training-free framework that rethinks reasoning segmentation by combining chain-of-thought reasoning with self-correction. Instead of fine-tuning, CoT-Seg leverages the inherent reasoning ability of pre-trained MLLMs (GPT-4o) to decompose queries into meta-instructions, extract fine-grained semantics from images, and identify target objects even under implicit or complex prompts. Moreover, CoT-Seg incorporates a self-correction stage: the model evaluates its own segmentation against the original query and reasoning trace, identifies mismatches, and iteratively refines the mask. This tight integration of reasoning and correction significantly improves reliability and robustness, especially in ambiguous or error-prone cases. Furthermore, our CoT-Seg framework allows easy incorporation of retrieval-augmented reasoning, enabling the system to access external knowledge when the input lacks sufficient information. To showcase CoT-Seg's ability to handle very challenging cases ,we introduce a new dataset ReasonSeg-Hard. Our results highlight that combining chain-of-thought reasoning, self-correction, offers a powerful paradigm for vision-language integration driven segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17420v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Oops, Wait: Token-Level Signals as a Lens into LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17421</link><description>arXiv:2601.17421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of discourse-like tokens such as "wait" and "therefore" in large language models (LLMs) has offered a unique window into their reasoning processes. However, systematic analyses of how such signals vary across training strategies and model scales remain lacking. In this paper, we analyze token-level signals through token probabilities across various models. We find that specific tokens strongly correlate with reasoning correctness, varying with training strategies while remaining stable across model scales. A closer look at the "wait" token in relation to answer probability demonstrates that models fine-tuned on small-scale datasets acquire reasoning ability through such signals but exploit them only partially. This work provides a systematic lens to observe and understand the dynamics of LLM reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17421v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Faster modular composition using two relation matrices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17422</link><description>arXiv:2601.17422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular composition is the problem of computing the composition of two univariate polynomials modulo a third one. For a long time, the fastest algebraic algorithm for this problem was that of Brent and Kung (1978). Recently, we improved Brent and Kung's algorithm by computing and using a polynomial matrix that encodes a certain basis of algebraic relations between the polynomials. This is further improved here by making use of two polynomial matrices of smaller dimension. Under genericity assumptions on the input, this results in an algorithm using $\tilde{O}(n^{(\omega+3)/4})$ arithmetic operations in the base field, where $\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. With naive matrix multiplication, this is $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$, while with the best currently known exponent $\omega$ this is $O(n^{1.343})$, improving upon the previously most efficient algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17422v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Joint Uplink-Downlink Fronthaul Bit Allocation in Fronthaul-Limited Massive MU-MIMO Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17423</link><description>arXiv:2601.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper optimizes the fronthaul bit allocation in massive multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems operating with limited-capacity fronthaul links. We consider an advanced antenna system (AAS) controlled by a centralized baseband unit (BBU). In the AAS, multiple antenna elements together with their radio units are integrated into a single unit. In this setup, a key challenge is allocating fronthaul bits between uplink channel state information (CSI) quantization and downlink precoding matrix quantization. We formulate the problem of maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE) for a given fronthaul capacity. We develop an SE expression for this scenario based on the hardening bound. We compute the expression in closed form for maximum ratio transmission, which reveals the relative impact of the two types of quantization distortion. We then formulate a bit split optimization problem and propose an algorithm that exactly solves it.
  Numerical results demonstrate how the relative importance of assigning bits to CSI and precoding varies depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17423v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Syllogistic Probe: Tracing the Evolution of Logic Reasoning in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17426</link><description>arXiv:2601.17426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human logic has gradually shifted from intuition-driven inference to rigorous formal systems. Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we explore whether LLMs exhibit a similar evolution in the underlying logical framework. Using existential import as a probe, we for evaluate syllogism under traditional and modern logic. Through extensive experiments of testing SOTA LLMs on a new syllogism dataset, we have some interesting findings: (i) Model size scaling promotes the shift toward modern logic; (ii) Thinking serves as an efficient accelerator beyond parameter scaling; (iii) the Base model plays a crucial role in determining how easily and stably this shift can emerge. Beyond these core factors, we conduct additional experiments for in-depth analysis of properties of current LLMs on syllogistic reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17426v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Rough Terrain Locomotion with Automatic Curriculum Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17428</link><description>arXiv:2601.17428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curriculum learning has demonstrated substantial effectiveness in robot learning. However, it still faces limitations when scaling to complex, wide-ranging task spaces. Such task spaces often lack a well-defined difficulty structure, making the difficulty ordering required by previous methods challenging to define. We propose a Learning Progress-based Automatic Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (LP-ACRL) framework, which estimates the agent's learning progress online and adaptively adjusts the task-sampling distribution, thereby enabling automatic curriculum generation without prior knowledge of the difficulty distribution over the task space. Policies trained with LP-ACRL enable the ANYmal D quadruped to achieve and maintain stable, high-speed locomotion at 2.5 m/s linear velocity and 3.0 rad/s angular velocity across diverse terrains, including stairs, slopes, gravel, and low-friction flat surfaces--whereas previous methods have generally been limited to high speeds on flat terrain or low speeds on complex terrain. Experimental results demonstrate that LP-ACRL exhibits strong scalability and real-world applicability, providing a robust baseline for future research on curriculum generation in complex, wide-ranging robotic learning task spaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Coronary Artery Segmentation and Vessel-Type Classification in X-Ray Angiography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17429</link><description>arXiv:2601.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray coronary angiography (XCA) is the clinical reference standard for assessing coronary artery disease, yet quantitative analysis is limited by the difficulty of robust vessel segmentation in routine data. Low contrast, motion, foreshortening, overlap, and catheter confounding degrade segmentation and contribute to domain shift across centers. Reliable segmentation, together with vessel-type labeling, enables vessel-specific coronary analytics and downstream measurements that depend on anatomical localization. From 670 cine sequences (407 subjects), we select a best frame near peak opacification using a low-intensity histogram criterion and apply joint super-resolution and enhancement. We benchmark classical Meijering, Frangi, and Sato vesselness filters under per-image oracle tuning, a single global mean setting, and per-image parameter prediction via Support Vector Regression (SVR). Neural baselines include U-Net, FPN, and a Swin Transformer, trained with coronary-only and merged coronary+catheter supervision. A second stage assigns vessel identity (LAD, LCX, RCA). External evaluation uses the public DCA1 cohort. SVR per-image tuning improves Dice over global means for all classical filters (e.g., Frangi: 0.759 vs. 0.741). Among deep models, FPN attains 0.914+/-0.007 Dice (coronary-only), and merged coronary+catheter labels further improve to 0.931+/-0.006. On DCA1 as a strict external test, Dice drops to 0.798 (coronary-only) and 0.814 (merged), while light in-domain fine-tuning recovers to 0.881+/-0.014 and 0.882+/-0.015. Vessel-type labeling achieves 98.5% accuracy (Dice 0.844) for RCA, 95.4% (0.786) for LAD, and 96.2% (0.794) for LCX. Learned per-image tuning strengthens classical pipelines, while high-resolution FPN models and merged-label supervision improve stability and external transfer with modest adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17429v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Active Hypothesis Testing for Correlated Combinatorial Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17430</link><description>arXiv:2601.17430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of identifying an anomalous subset of streams under correlated noise, motivated by monitoring and security in cyber-physical systems. This problem can be viewed as a form of combinatorial pure exploration, where each stream plays the role of an arm and measurements must be allocated sequentially under uncertainty. Existing combinatorial bandit and hypothesis testing methods typically assume independent observations and fail to exploit correlation for efficient measurement design. We propose ECC-AHT, an adaptive algorithm that selects continuous, constrained measurements to maximize Chernoff information between competing hypotheses, enabling active noise cancellation through differential sensing. ECC-AHT achieves optimal sample complexity guarantees and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both synthetic and real-world correlated environments.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific writing promises efficiency but risks introducing informational entropy. While "hallucinated papers" are a known artifact, the systematic degradation of valid citation chains remains unquantified. We conducted a forensic audit of 50 recent survey papers in Artificial Intelligence (N=5,514 citations) published between September 2024 and January 2026. We utilized a hybrid verification pipeline combining DOI resolution, Crossref metadata analysis, Semantic Scholar queries, and fuzzy text matching to distinguish between formatting errors ("Sloppiness") and verifiable non-existence ("Phantoms). We detect a persistent 17.0% Phantom Rate -- citations that cannot be resolved to any digital object despite aggressive forensic recovery. Diagnostic categorization reveals three distinct failure modes: pure hallucinations (5.1%), hallucinated identifiers with valid titles (16.4%), and parsing-induced matching failures (78.5%). Longitudinal analysis reveals a flat trend (+0.07 pp/month), suggesting that high-entropy citation practices have stabilized as an endemic feature of the field. The scientific citation graph in AI survey literature exhibits "link rot" at scale. This suggests a mechanism where AI tools act as "lazy research assistants," retrieving correct titles but hallucinating metadata, thereby severing the digital chain of custody required for reproducible science.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17431v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Co-Designing Digital Humans for Online Learning: A Framework for Human-AI Pedagogical Integration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17434</link><description>arXiv:2601.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) are reshaping education, with virtual avatars emerging as digital teachers capable of enhancing engagement, sustaining attention, and addressing instructor shortages. Aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for equitable quality education, these technologies hold promise yet lack clear guidelines for effective design and implementation in online learning. To fill this gap, we introduce a framework specifying when, what, and how digital teachers should be integrated. Our study combines (1) a design space analysis of 87 works across AI, educational technology, design, and HCI, (2) a survey of 132 learners' practices and preferences, and (3) three co-design workshops with 18 experts from pedagogy, design, and AI. It provides actionable guidance for educators, designers, and HCI researchers, advancing opportunities to build more engaging, equitable, and effective online learning environments powered by digital teachers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17434v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards a Declarative Agentic Layer for Intelligent Agents in MCP-Based Server Ecosystems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17435</link><description>arXiv:2601.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of increasingly complex agentic and multi-agent systems capable of planning, tool use and task decomposition. However, empirical evidence shows that many of these systems suffer from fundamental reliability issues, including hallucinated actions, unexecutable plans and brittle coordination. Crucially, these failures do not stem from limitations of the underlying models themselves, but from the absence of explicit architectural structure linking goals, capabilities and execution. This paper presents a declarative, model-independent architectural layer for grounded agentic workflows that addresses this gap. The proposed layer, referred to as DALIA (Declarative Agentic Layer for Intelligent Agents), formalises executable capabilities, exposes tasks through a declarative discovery protocol, maintains a federated directory of agents and their execution resources, and constructs deterministic task graphs grounded exclusively in declared operations. By enforcing a clear separation between discovery, planning and execution, the architecture constrains agent behaviour to a verifiable operational space, reducing reliance on speculative reasoning and free-form coordination. We present the architecture and design principles of the proposed layer and illustrate its operation through a representative task-oriented scenario, demonstrating how declarative grounding enables reproducible and verifiable agentic workflows across heterogeneous environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17435v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniGRec: Unified Generative Recommendation with Soft Identifiers for End-to-End Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17438</link><description>arXiv:2601.17438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a transformative paradigm that directly generates target items, surpassing traditional cascaded approaches. It typically involves two components: a tokenizer that learns item identifiers and a recommender trained on them. Existing methods often decouple tokenization from recommendation or rely on asynchronous alternating optimization, limiting full end-to-end alignment. To address this, we unify the tokenizer and recommender under the ultimate recommendation objective via differentiable soft item identifiers, enabling joint end-to-end training. However, this introduces three challenges: training-inference discrepancy due to soft-to-hard mismatch, item identifier collapse from codeword usage imbalance, and collaborative signal deficiency due to an overemphasis on fine-grained token-level semantics.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose UniGRec, a unified generative recommendation framework that addresses them from three perspectives. UniGRec employs Annealed Inference Alignment during tokenization to smoothly bridge soft training and hard inference, a Codeword Uniformity Regularization to prevent identifier collapse and encourage codebook diversity, and a Dual Collaborative Distillation mechanism that distills collaborative priors from a lightweight teacher model to jointly guide both the tokenizer and the recommender. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniGRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold great potential for diverse interactions and daily service tasks within human-centered environments, necessitating controllers that seamlessly integrate precise locomotion with dexterous manipulation. However, most existing whole-body controllers lack exteroceptive awareness of the surrounding environment, rendering them insufficient for stable task execution in complex, unstructured scenarios.To address this challenge, we propose PILOT, a unified single-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for perceptive loco-manipulation, which synergizes perceptive locomotion and expansive whole-body control within a single policy. To enhance terrain awareness and ensure precise foot placement, we design a cross-modal context encoder that fuses prediction-based proprioceptive features with attention-based perceptive representations. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) policy architecture to coordinate diverse motor skills, facilitating better specialization across distinct motion patterns. Extensive experiments in both simulation and on the physical Unitree G1 humanoid robot validate the efficacy of our framework. PILOT demonstrates superior stability, command tracking precision, and terrain traversability compared to existing baselines. These results highlight its potential to serve as a robust, foundational low-level controller for loco-manipulation in unstructured scenes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17440v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-driven Clustering and Merging of Adapters for On-device Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17441</link><description>arXiv:2601.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-device large language models commonly employ task-specific adapters (e.g., LoRAs) to deliver strong performance on downstream tasks. While storing all available adapters is impractical due to memory constraints, mobile devices typically have sufficient capacity to store a limited number of these parameters. This raises a critical challenge: how to select representative adapters that generalize well across multiple tasks - a problem that remains unexplored in existing literature. We propose a novel method D2C for adapter clustering that leverages minimal task-specific examples (e.g., 10 per task) and employs an iterative optimization process to refine cluster assignments. The adapters within each cluster are merged, creating multi-task adapters deployable on resource-constrained devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively boosts performance for considered storage budgets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17441v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A new approach for combined model class selection and parameters learning for auto-regressive neural models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17442</link><description>arXiv:2601.17442v1 Announce Type: new

The results show the effectiveness of the approach in identifying parsimonious yet accurate models suitable for control applications. Moreover, the proposed framework enables a robust training strategy that explicitly accounts for bounded measurement noise and enhances model robustness by allowing data-consistent evaluation of simulation performance during parameter learning, a process generally NP-hard for models with autoregressive components.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Clustering-driven Memory Compression for On-device Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17443</link><description>arXiv:2601.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often rely on user-specific memories distilled from past interactions to enable personalized generation. A common practice is to concatenate these memories with the input prompt, but this approach quickly exhausts the limited context available in on-device LLMs. Compressing memories by averaging can mitigate context growth, yet it frequently harms performance due to semantic conflicts across heterogeneous memories. In this work, we introduce a clustering-based memory compression strategy that balances context efficiency and personalization quality. Our method groups memories by similarity and merges them within clusters prior to concatenation, thereby preserving coherence while reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers the number of memory tokens while outperforming baseline strategies such as naive averaging or direct concatenation. Furthermore, for a fixed context budget, clustering-driven merging yields more compact memory representations and consistently enhances generation quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17443v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DREAM: Dual-Standard Semantic Homogeneity with Dynamic Optimization for Graph Learning with Label Noise</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17449</link><description>arXiv:2601.17449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various graph machine learning scenarios. Existing literature primarily assumes well-annotated training graphs, while the reliability of labels is not guaranteed in real-world scenarios. Recently, efforts have been made to address the problem of graph learning with label noise. However, existing methods often (i) struggle to distinguish between reliable and unreliable nodes, and (ii) overlook the relational information embedded in the graph topology. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel method, Dual-Standard Semantic Homogeneity with Dynamic Optimization (DREAM), for reliable, relation-informed optimization on graphs with label noise. Specifically, we design a relation-informed dynamic optimization framework that iteratively reevaluates the reliability of each labeled node in the graph during the optimization process according to the relation of the target node and other nodes. To measure this relation comprehensively, we propose a dual-standard selection strategy that selects a set of anchor nodes based on both node proximity and graph topology. Subsequently, we compute the semantic homogeneity between the target node and the anchor nodes, which serves as guidance for optimization. We also provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to justify the design of DREAM. Extensive experiments are performed on six graph datasets across various domains under three types of graph label noise against competing baselines, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DREAM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17449v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-driven Test Generation for Fuzzing AI Compiler</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17450</link><description>arXiv:2601.17450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) compilers are critical for efficiently deploying AI models across diverse hardware platforms. However, they remain prone to bugs that can compromise both compiler reliability and model correctness. Thus, ensuring the quality of AI compilers is crucial. In this work, we present a unified data-driven testing framework that systematically addresses stage-specific challenges in AI compilers. Specifically, OPERA migrates tests for AI libraries to test various operator conversion logic in the model loading stage. OATest synthesizes diverse optimization-aware computational graphs for testing high-level optimizations. HARMONY generates and mutates diverse low-level IR seeds to generate hardware-optimization-aware tests for testing low-level optimizations. Together, these techniques provide a comprehensive, stage-aware framework that enhances testing coverage and effectiveness, detecting 266 previously unknown bugs in four widely used AI compilers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17450v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Numerical Study of Dissipative Weak Solutions for the Euler Equations of Gas Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17452</link><description>arXiv:2601.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dissipative weak (DW) solutions of the Euler equations of gas dynamics using the first-, second-, third-, fifth-, seventh-, and ninth-order local characteristic decomposition-based central-upwind (LCDCU), low-dissipation central-upwind (LDCU), and viscous finite volume (VFV) methods, whose higher-order extensions are obtained via the framework of the alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) schemes. These methods are applied to several benchmark problems, including several two-dimensional Riemann problems and a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability test. The numerical results demonstrate that for methods converging only weakly in space and time, the limiting solutions are generalized DW solutions, approximated in the sense of ${\cal K}$-convergence and dependent on the numerical scheme. For all of the studied methods, we compute the associated Young measures and compare the DW solutions using entropy production and energy defect criteria.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17452v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Embodiment-Induced Coordination Regimes in Tabular Multi-Agent Q-Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17454</link><description>arXiv:2601.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centralized value learning is often assumed to improve coordination and stability in multi-agent reinforcement learning, yet this assumption is rarely tested under controlled conditions. We directly evaluate it in a fully tabular predator-prey gridworld by comparing independent and centralized Q-learning under explicit embodiment constraints on agent speed and stamina. Across multiple kinematic regimes and asymmetric agent roles, centralized learning fails to provide a consistent advantage and is frequently outperformed by fully independent learning, even under full observability and exact value estimation. Moreover, asymmetric centralized-independent configurations induce persistent coordination breakdowns rather than transient learning instability. By eliminating confounding effects from function approximation and representation learning, our tabular analysis isolates coordination structure as the primary driver of these effects. The results show that increased coordination can become a liability under embodiment constraints, and that the effectiveness of centralized learning is fundamentally regime and role dependent rather than universal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17454v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Seconds Count: Designing Real-Time VR Interventions for Stress Inoculation Training in Novice Physicians</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17458</link><description>arXiv:2601.17458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical emergencies often trigger acute cognitive overload in novice physicians, impairing their decision-making under pressure. Although Virtual Reality-based Stress Inoculation Training (VR-SIT) shows promise, current systems fall short in delivering real-time, effective support during moments of peak stress. To bridge this gap, we first conducted a formative study (N=12) to uncover the core needs of novice physicians for immediate assistance under acute stress and identified three key intervention strategies: self-regulation aids, procedure guidance, and emotional/sensory support. Building on these insights, we designed and implemented a novel VR-SIT system that incorporates a just-in-time adaptive intervention framework, dynamically tailoring support to learners' cognitive and emotional states. We then validated these strategies in a user study (N=26). Our findings provide empirical evidence and design implications for next-generation VR medical training systems, supporting physicians in sustaining cognitive clarity and accurate decision-making in critical situations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17458v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Output Regulation of Uncertain Linear Time-Varying Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17464</link><description>arXiv:2601.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust output regulation for linear time-varying systems has remained an open problem for decades. To address this, we propose intrinsic system immersion by reformulating the regulator equation in a more insightful form, indicating that finding an internal model is equivalent to reproducing the output trajectory of a forced system by constructing an unforced system. This perspective reveals the influence of parametric uncertainties, demonstrating that an infinite-dimensional controller is generally unavoidable for robustness against plant uncertainty. Consequently, a general robust design is proposed without explicitly solving the regulator equation. It ensures robustness against uncertainties in the exosystem interaction, and achieves approximate output regulation when an infinite-dimensional controller is necessary for regulation. Additionally, we study the regulator equation in a coordinate-free framework, extend the time-varying non-resonance condition, and provide a method to minimize the dimension of an internal model. Overall, these results provide a general systematic framework for constructing robust internal model-based controllers, and simplify the control implementation process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17464v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Harnessing Reasoning Trajectories for Hallucination Detection via Answer-agreement Representation Shaping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17467</link><description>arXiv:2601.17467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often generate long, seemingly coherent reasoning traces yet still produce incorrect answers, making hallucination detection challenging. Although trajectories contain useful signals, directly using trace text or vanilla hidden states for detection is brittle: traces vary in form and detectors can overfit to superficial patterns rather than answer validity. We introduce Answer-agreement Representation Shaping (ARS), which learns detection-friendly trace-conditioned representations by explicitly encoding answer stability. ARS generates counterfactual answers through small latent interventions, specifically, perturbing the trace-boundary embedding, and labels each perturbation by whether the resulting answer agrees with the original. It then learns representations that bring answer-agreeing states together and separate answer-disagreeing ones, exposing latent instability indicative of hallucination risk. The shaped embeddings are plug-and-play with existing embedding-based detectors and require no human annotations during training. Experiments demonstrate that ARS consistently improves detection and achieves substantial gains over strong baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17467v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReflexSplit: Single Image Reflection Separation via Layer Fusion-Separation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17468</link><description>arXiv:2601.17468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single Image Reflection Separation (SIRS) disentangles mixed images into transmission and reflection layers. Existing methods suffer from transmission-reflection confusion under nonlinear mixing, particularly in deep decoder layers, due to implicit fusion mechanisms and inadequate multi-scale coordination. We propose ReflexSplit, a dual-stream framework with three key innovations. (1) Cross-scale Gated Fusion (CrGF) adaptively aggregates semantic priors, texture details, and decoder context across hierarchical depths, stabilizing gradient flow and maintaining feature consistency. (2) Layer Fusion-Separation Blocks (LFSB) alternate between fusion for shared structure extraction and differential separation for layer-specific disentanglement. Inspired by Differential Transformer, we extend attention cancellation to dual-stream separation via cross-stream subtraction. (3) Curriculum training progressively strengthens differential separation through depth-dependent initialization and epoch-wise warmup. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with superior perceptual quality and robust generalization.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable capabilities in learning from graph-structured data with various applications such as social analysis and bioinformatics. However, the presence of label noise in real scenarios poses a significant challenge in learning robust GNNs, and their effectiveness can be severely impacted when dealing with noisy labels on graphs, often stemming from annotation errors or inconsistencies. To address this, in this paper we propose a novel approach called ICGNN that harnesses the structure information of the graph to effectively alleviate the challenges posed by noisy labels. Specifically, we first design a novel noise indicator that measures the influence contradiction score (ICS) based on the graph diffusion matrix to quantify the credibility of nodes with clean labels, such that nodes with higher ICS values are more likely to be detected as having noisy labels. Then we leverage the Gaussian mixture model to precisely detect whether the label of a node is noisy or not. Additionally, we develop a soft strategy to combine the predictions from neighboring nodes on the graph to correct the detected noisy labels. At last, pseudo-labeling for abundant unlabeled nodes is incorporated to provide auxiliary supervision signals and guide the model optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of our proposed approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17469v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PhaSR: Generalized Image Shadow Removal with Physically Aligned Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17470</link><description>arXiv:2601.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shadow removal under diverse lighting conditions requires disentangling illumination from intrinsic reflectance, a challenge compounded when physical priors are not properly aligned. We propose PhaSR (Physically Aligned Shadow Removal), addressing this through dual-level prior alignment to enable robust performance from single-light shadows to multi-source ambient lighting. First, Physically Aligned Normalization (PAN) performs closed-form illumination correction via Gray-world normalization, log-domain Retinex decomposition, and dynamic range recombination, suppressing chromatic bias. Second, Geometric-Semantic Rectification Attention (GSRA) extends differential attention to cross-modal alignment, harmonizing depth-derived geometry with DINO-v2 semantic embeddings to resolve modal conflicts under varying illumination. Experiments show competitive performance in shadow removal with lower complexity and generalization to ambient lighting where traditional methods fail under multi-source illumination.

Abstract: Continuous fuzzing platforms such as OSS-Fuzz uncover large numbers of vulnerabilities, yet the subsequent repair process remains largely manual. Unfortunately, existing Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) techniques -- including recent LLM-based systems -- are not directly applicable to continuous fuzzing. This is because these systems are designed and evaluated on a static, single-run benchmark setting, making them ill-suited for the diverse, noisy, and failure-prone environments in continuous fuzzing.
  To address these issues, we introduce PatchIsland, a system for Continuous Vulnerability Repair (CVR) that tightly integrates with continuous fuzzing pipelines. PatchIsland employs an ensemble of diverse LLM agents. By leveraging multiple LLM agents, PatchIsland can cover a wider range of settings (e.g., different projects, bug types, and programming languages) and also improve operational robustness. In addition, PatchIsland utilizes a two-phase patch-based deduplication to mitigate duplicate crashes and patches, which can be problematic in continuous fuzzing.
  In our internal evaluation, PatchIsland repaired 84 of 92 vulnerabilities, demonstrating strong repair capability. In the official AIxCC competition, the system operated with no human intervention in a fully autonomous environment and successfully patched 31 out of 43 vulnerabilities, achieving a repair rate of 72.1\%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17471v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Alignment and Disentanglement for Cross-Domain CTR Prediction with Domain-Encompassing Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17472</link><description>arXiv:2601.17472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been increasingly explored to address data sparsity and cold-start issues. However, recent approaches typically disentangle domain-invariant features shared between source and target domains, as well as domain-specific features for each domain. However, they often rely solely on domain-invariant features combined with target domain-specific features, which can lead to suboptimal performance. To overcome the limitations, this paper presents the Adversarial Alignment and Disentanglement Cross-Domain Recommendation ($A^2DCDR$ ) model, an innovative approach designed to capture a comprehensive range of cross-domain information, including both domain-invariant and valuable non-aligned features. The $A^2DCDR$ model enhances cross-domain recommendation through three key components: refining MMD with adversarial training for better generalization, employing a feature disentangler and reconstruction mechanism for intra-domain disentanglement, and introducing a novel fused representation combining domain-invariant, non-aligned features with original contextual data. Experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B testing show that $A^2DCDR$ outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Theorem provers such as Lean allow for provable-correctness, but these are hard for students to learn. We present a proof-of-concept system (LeanTutor) by combining the complementary strengths of LLMs and theorem provers. LeanTutor is composed of three modules: (i) an autoformalizer/proof-checker, (ii) a next-step generator, and (iii) a natural language feedback generator. To evaluate the system, we introduce PeanoBench, a dataset of 371 Peano Arithmetic proofs in human-written natural language and formal language, derived from the Natural Numbers Game.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17473v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unintended Memorization of Sensitive Information in Fine-Tuned Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17480</link><description>arXiv:2601.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on sensitive datasets carries a substantial risk of unintended memorization and leakage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which can violate privacy regulations and compromise individual safety. In this work, we systematically investigate a critical and underexplored vulnerability: the exposure of PII that appears only in model inputs, not in training targets. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we design controlled extraction probes to quantify unintended PII memorization and study how factors such as language, PII frequency, task type, and model size influence memorization behavior. We further benchmark four privacy-preserving approaches including differential privacy, machine unlearning, regularization, and preference alignment, evaluating their trade-offs between privacy and task performance. Our results show that post-training methods generally provide more consistent privacy-utility trade-offs, while differential privacy achieves strong reduction in leakage in specific settings, although it can introduce training instability. These findings highlight the persistent challenge of memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and emphasize the need for robust, scalable privacy-preserving techniques.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17480v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lattice: Generative Guardrails for Conversational Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17481</link><description>arXiv:2601.17481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational AI systems require guardrails to prevent harmful outputs, yet existing approaches use static rules that cannot adapt to new threats or deployment contexts. We introduce Lattice, a framework for self-constructing and continuously improving guardrails. Lattice operates in two stages: construction builds initial guardrails from labeled examples through iterative simulation and optimization; continuous improvement autonomously adapts deployed guardrails through risk assessment, adversarial testing, and consolidation. Evaluated on the ProsocialDialog dataset, Lattice achieves 91% F1 on held-out data, outperforming keyword baselines by 43pp, LlamaGuard by 25pp, and NeMo by 4pp. The continuous improvement stage achieves 7pp F1 improvement on cross-domain data through closed-loop optimization. Our framework shows that effective guardrails can be self-constructed through iterative optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17481v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LogPrism: Unifying Structure and Variable Encoding for Effective Log Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17482</link><description>arXiv:2601.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing "parse-then-compress" paradigm in log compression fundamentally limits effectiveness by treating log parsing and compression as isolated objectives. While parsers prioritize semantic accuracy (i.e., event identification), they often obscure deep correlations between static templates and dynamic variables that are critical for storage efficiency. In this paper, we investigate this misalignment through a comprehensive empirical study and propose LogPrism, a framework that bridges the gap via unified redundancy encoding. Rather than relying on a rigid pre-parsing step, LogPrism dynamically integrates structural extraction with variable encoding by constructing a Unified Redundancy Tree (URT). This hierarchical approach effectively mines "structure+variable" co-occurrence patterns, capturing deep contextual redundancies while accelerating processing through pre-emptive pattern encoding. Extensive experiments on 16 benchmark datasets confirm that LogPrism establishes a new state-of-the-art. It achieves the highest compression ratio on 13 datasets, surpassing leading baselines by margins of 4.7% to 80.9%, while delivering superior throughput at 29.87 MB/s (1.68$\times$~43.04$\times$ faster than competitors). Moreover, when configured in single-archive mode to maximize global pattern discovery, LogPrism outperforms the best baseline by 19.39% in compression ratio while maintaining a 2.62$\times$ speed advantage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17482v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automatic Stability and Recovery for Neural Network Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17483</link><description>arXiv:2601.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training modern neural networks is increasingly fragile, with rare but severe destabilizing updates often causing irreversible divergence or silent performance degradation. Existing optimization methods primarily rely on preventive mechanisms embedded within the optimizer, offering limited ability to detect and recover from instability once it occurs. We introduce a supervisory runtime stability framework that treats optimization as a controlled stochastic process. By isolating an innovation signal derived from secondary measurements, such as validation probes, the framework enables automatic detection and recovery from destabilizing updates without modifying the underlying optimizer. We provide theoretical runtime safety guarantees that formalize bounded degradation and recovery. Our implementation incurs minimal overhead and is compatible with memory-constrained training settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17483v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EquiForm: Noise-Robust SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning from 3D Point Clouds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17486</link><description>arXiv:2601.17486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual imitation learning with 3D point clouds has advanced robotic manipulation by providing geometry-aware, appearance-invariant observations. However, point cloud-based policies remain highly sensitive to sensor noise, pose perturbations, and occlusion-induced artifacts, which distort geometric structure and break the equivariance assumptions required for robust generalization. Existing equivariant approaches primarily encode symmetry constraints into neural architectures, but do not explicitly correct noise-induced geometric deviations or enforce equivariant consistency in learned representations. We introduce EquiForm, a noise-robust SE(3)-equivariant policy learning framework for point cloud-based manipulation. EquiForm formalizes how noise-induced geometric distortions lead to equivariance deviations in observation-to-action mappings, and introduces a geometric denoising module to restore consistent 3D structure under noisy or incomplete observations. In addition, we propose a contrastive equivariant alignment objective that enforces representation consistency under both rigid transformations and noise perturbations. Built upon these components, EquiForm forms a flexible policy learning pipeline that integrates noise-robust geometric reasoning with modern generative models. We evaluate EquiForm on 16 simulated tasks and 4 real-world manipulation tasks across diverse objects and scene layouts. Compared to state-of-the-art point cloud imitation learning methods, EquiForm achieves an average improvement of 17.2% in simulation and 28.1% in real-world experiments, demonstrating strong noise robustness and spatial generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17486v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SpatialMath: Spatial Comprehension-Infused Symbolic Reasoning for Mathematical Problem-Solving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17489</link><description>arXiv:2601.17489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Small-to-Medium sized Language Models (MSLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in integrating visual and textual information but still face significant limitations in visual comprehension and mathematical reasoning, particularly in geometric problems with diverse levels of visual infusion. Current models struggle to accurately decompose intricate visual inputs and connect perception with structured reasoning, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose SpatialMath, a novel Spatial Comprehension-Infused Symbolic Reasoning Framework designed to integrate spatial representations into structured symbolic reasoning chains. SpatialMath employs a specialized perception module to extract spatially-grounded representations from visual diagrams, capturing critical geometric structures and spatial relationships. These representations are then methodically infused into symbolic reasoning chains, facilitating visual comprehension-aware structured reasoning. To this end, we introduce MATHVERSE-PLUS, a novel dataset containing structured visual interpretations and step-by-step reasoning paths for vision-intensive mathematical problems. SpatialMath significantly outperforms strong multimodal baselines, achieving up to 10 percentage points improvement over supervised fine-tuning with data augmentation in vision-intensive settings. Robustness analysis reveals that enhanced spatial representations directly improve reasoning accuracy, reinforcing the need for structured perception-to-reasoning pipelines in MSLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17489v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Fair Large Language Model-based Recommender Systems without Costly Retraining</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17492</link><description>arXiv:2601.17492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Recommender Systems (RS) through advanced generative user modeling. However, LLM-based RS (LLM-RS) often inadvertently perpetuates bias present in the training data, leading to severe fairness issues. Addressing these fairness problems in LLM-RS faces two significant challenges. 1) Existing debiasing methods, designed for specific bias types, lack the generality to handle diverse or emerging biases in real-world applications. 2) Debiasing methods relying on retraining are computationally infeasible given the massive parameter scale of LLMs. To overcome these challenges, we propose FUDLR (Fast Unified Debiasing for LLM-RS). The core idea is to reformulate the debiasing problem as an efficient machine unlearning task with two stages. First, FUDLR identifies bias-inducing samples to unlearn through a novel bias-agnostic mask, optimized to balance fairness improvement with accuracy preservation. Its bias-agnostic design allows adaptability to various or co-existing biases simply by incorporating different fairness metrics.

Abstract: In many deployed systems, new text inputs are handled by retrieving similar past cases, for example when routing and responding to citizen messages in digital governance platforms. When these systems fail, the problem is often not the language model itself, but that the nearest neighbors in the embedding space correspond to the wrong cases. Modern machine learning systems increasingly rely on fixed, high-dimensional embeddings produced by large pretrained models and sentence encoders. In real-world deployments, labels are scarce, domains shift over time, and retraining the base encoder is expensive or infeasible. As a result, downstream performance depends heavily on embedding geometry. Yet raw embeddings are often poorly aligned with the local neighborhood structure required by nearest-neighbor retrieval, similarity search, and lightweight classifiers that operate directly on embeddings. We propose PEARL (Prototype-Enhanced Aligned Representation Learning), a label-efficient approach that uses limited supervision to softly align embeddings toward class prototypes. The method reshapes local neighborhood geometry while preserving dimensionality and avoiding aggressive projection or collapse. Its aim is to bridge the gap between purely unsupervised post-processing, which offers limited and inconsistent gains, and fully supervised projections that require substantial labeled data. We evaluate PEARL under controlled label regimes ranging from extreme label scarcity to higher-label settings. In the label-scarce condition, PEARL substantially improves local neighborhood quality, yielding 25.7% gains over raw embeddings and more than 21.1% gains relative to strong unsupervised post-processing, precisely in the regime where similarity-based systems are most brittle.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17495v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Impossibility of Simulation Security for Quantum Functional Encryption</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17497</link><description>arXiv:2601.17497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional encryption is a powerful cryptographic primitive that enables fine-grained access to encrypted data and underlies numerous applications. Although the ideal security notion for FE (simulation security) has been shown to be impossible in the classical setting, those impossibility results rely on inherently classical arguments. This leaves open the question of whether simulation-secure functional encryption can be achieved in the quantum regime.
  In this work, we rule out this possibility by showing that the classical impossibility results largely extend to the quantum world. In particular, when the adversary can issue an unbounded number of challenge messages, we prove an unconditional impossibility, matching the classical barrier. In the case where the adversary may obtain many functional keys, classical arguments only yield impossibility under the assumption of pseudorandom functions; we strengthen this by proving impossibility under the potentially weaker assumption of pseudorandom quantum states. In the same setting, we also establish an alternative impossibility based on public-key encryption. Since public-key encryption is not known to imply pseudorandom quantum states, this provides independent evidence of the barrier. As part of our proofs, we show a novel incompressibility property for pseudorandom states, which may be of independent interest.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17497v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] To Case or Not to Case: An Empirical Study in Learned Sparse Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17500</link><description>arXiv:2601.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) methods construct sparse lexical representations of queries and documents that can be efficiently searched using inverted indexes. Existing LSR approaches have relied almost exclusively on uncased backbone models, whose vocabularies exclude case-sensitive distinctions, thereby reducing vocabulary mismatch. However, the most recent state-of-the-art language models are only available in cased versions. Despite this shift, the impact of backbone model casing on LSR has not been studied, potentially posing a risk to the viability of the method going forward. To fill this gap, we systematically evaluate paired cased and uncased versions of the same backbone models across multiple datasets to assess their suitability for LSR. Our findings show that LSR models with cased backbone models by default perform substantially worse than their uncased counterparts; however, this gap can be eliminated by pre-processing the text to lowercase. Moreover, our token-level analysis reveals that, under lowercasing, cased models almost entirely suppress cased vocabulary items and behave effectively as uncased models, explaining their restored performance. This result broadens the applicability of recent cased models to the LSR setting and facilitates the integration of stronger backbone architectures into sparse retrieval.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prerequisite for precise radiotherapy planning and surgical navigation. While recent Transformer-based models such as Swin UNETR have achieved impressive benchmark performance, their clinical utility is often compromised by two critical issues: sensitivity to missing modalities (common in clinical practice) and a lack of confidence calibration. Merely chasing higher Dice scores on idealized data fails to meet the safety requirements of real-world medical deployment. In this work, we propose BMDS-Net, a unified framework that prioritizes clinical robustness and trustworthiness over simple metric maximization. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we construct a robust deterministic backbone by integrating a Zero-Init Multimodal Contextual Fusion (MMCF) module and a Residual-Gated Deep Decoder Supervision (DDS) mechanism, enabling stable feature learning and precise boundary delineation with significantly reduced Hausdorff Distance, even under modality corruption. Second, and most importantly, we introduce a memory-efficient Bayesian fine-tuning strategy that transforms the network into a probabilistic predictor, providing voxel-wise uncertainty maps to highlight potential errors for clinicians. Third, comprehensive experiments on the BraTS 2021 dataset demonstrate that BMDS-Net not only maintains competitive accuracy but, more importantly, exhibits superior stability in missing-modality scenarios where baseline models fail.

Abstract: Humanoid robot loco-manipulation remains constrained by the semantic-physical gap. Current methods face three limitations: Low sample efficiency in reinforcement learning, poor generalization in imitation learning, and physical inconsistency in VLMs. We propose MetaWorld, a hierarchical world model that integrates semantic planning and physical control via expert policy transfer. The framework decouples tasks into a VLM-driven semantic layer and a latent dynamics model operating in a compact state space. Our dynamic expert selection and motion prior fusion mechanism leverages a pre-trained multi-expert policy library as transferable knowledge, enabling efficient online adaptation via a two-stage framework. VLMs serve as semantic interfaces, mapping instructions to executable skills and bypassing symbol grounding. Experiments on Humanoid-Bench show MetaWorld outperforms world model-based RL in task completion and motion coherence.

Abstract: We consider the permanent of a square matrix with non-negative entries. A tractable approximation is given by the so-called Bethe permanent that can be efficiently computed by running the sum-product algorithm on a suitable factor graph. While the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent is, in the worst case, upper and lower bounded by expressions that are exponentially far apart in the matrix size, in practice it is observed for many ensembles of matrices of interest that this ratio is strongly concentrated around some value that depends only on the matrix size. In this paper, for an ensemble of block-structured matrices where entries in a block take the same value, we numerically study the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent. It is observed that also for this ensemble the ratio is strongly concentrated around some value depending only on a few key parameters of the ensemble. We use graph-cover-based approaches to explain the reasons for this behavior and to quantify the observed value.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17508v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One-Shot Federated Clustering of Non-Independent Completely Distributed Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17512</link><description>arXiv:2601.17512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) that extracts data knowledge while protecting the privacy of multiple clients has achieved remarkable results in distributed privacy-preserving IoT systems, including smart traffic flow monitoring, smart grid load balancing, and so on. Since most data collected from edge devices are unlabeled, unsupervised Federated Clustering (FC) is becoming increasingly popular for exploring pattern knowledge from complex distributed data. However, due to the lack of label guidance, the common Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) issue of clients have greatly challenged FC by posing the following problems: How to fuse pattern knowledge (i.e., cluster distribution) from Non-IID clients; How are the cluster distributions among clients related; and How does this relationship connect with the global knowledge fusion? In this paper, a more tricky but overlooked phenomenon in Non-IID is revealed, which bottlenecks the clustering performance of the existing FC approaches. That is, different clients could fragment a cluster, and accordingly, a more generalized Non-IID concept, i.e., Non-ICD (Non-Independent Completely Distributed), is derived. To tackle the above FC challenges, a new framework named GOLD (Global Oriented Local Distribution Learning) is proposed. GOLD first finely explores the potential incomplete local cluster distributions of clients, then uploads the distribution summarization to the server for global fusion, and finally performs local cluster enhancement under the guidance of the global distribution. Extensive experiments, including significance tests, ablation studies, scalability evaluations, qualitative results, etc., have been conducted to show the superiority of GOLD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17512v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EuleroDec: A Complex-Valued RVQ-VAE for Efficient and Robust Audio Coding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17517</link><description>arXiv:2601.17517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio codecs power discrete music generative modelling, music streaming, and immersive media by shrinking PCM audio to bandwidth-friendly bitrates. Recent works have gravitated towards processing in the spectral domain; however, spectrogram domains typically struggle with phase modeling, which is naturally complex-valued. Most frequency-domain neural codecs either disregard phase information or encode it as two separate real-valued channels, limiting spatial fidelity. This entails the need to introduce adversarial discriminators at the expense of convergence speed and training stability to compensate for the inadequate representation power of the audio signal. In this work we introduce an end-to-end complex-valued RVQ-VAE audio codec that preserves magnitude-phase coupling across the entire analysis-quantization-synthesis pipeline and removes adversarial discriminators and diffusion post-filters. Without GANs or diffusion, we match or surpass much longer-trained baselines in-domain and reach SOTA out-of-domain performance on phase coherence and waveform fidelity. Compared to standard baselines that train for hundreds of thousands of steps, our model, which reduces the training budget by an order of magnitude, is markedly more compute-efficient while preserving high perceptual quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17517v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Invited: Toward Sustainable and Transparent Benchmarking for Academic Physical Design Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17520</link><description>arXiv:2601.17520v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical image registration by achieving unprecedented speeds, yet its clinical application is hindered by a limited ability to generalize beyond the training domain, a critical weakness given the typically small scale of medical datasets. In this paper, we introduce FMIR, a foundation model-based registration framework that overcomes this limitation.Combining a foundation model-based feature encoder for extracting anatomical structures with a general registration head, and trained with a channel regularization strategy on just a single dataset, FMIR achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) in-domain performance while maintaining robust registration on out-of-domain images.Our approach demonstrates a viable path toward building generalizable medical imaging foundation models with limited resources.

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology poses a severe threat to social and political stability by enabling hyper-realistic synthetic media capable of manipulating public perception. However, existing detection methods struggle with two core limitations: (1) modality fragmentation, which leads to poor generalization across diverse and adversarial deepfake modalities; and (2) shallow inter-modal reasoning, resulting in limited detection of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. To address these, we propose ConLLM (Contrastive Learning with Large Language Models), a hybrid framework for robust multimodal deepfake detection. ConLLM employs a two-stage architecture: stage 1 uses Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) to extract modality-specific embeddings; stage 2 aligns these embeddings via contrastive learning to mitigate modality fragmentation, and refines them using LLM-based reasoning to address shallow inter-modal reasoning by capturing semantic inconsistencies. ConLLM demonstrates strong performance across audio, video, and audio-visual modalities. It reduces audio deepfake EER by up to 50%, improves video accuracy by up to 8%, and achieves approximately 9% accuracy gains in audio-visual tasks. Ablation studies confirm that PTM-based embeddings contribute 9%-10% consistent improvements across modalities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17530v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Less is More for RAG: Information Gain Pruning for Generator-Aligned Reranking and Evidence Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17532</link><description>arXiv:2601.17532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds large language models with external evidence, but under a limited context budget, the key challenge is deciding which retrieved passages should be injected. We show that retrieval relevance metrics (e.g., NDCG) correlate weakly with end-to-end QA quality and can even become negatively correlated under multi-passage injection, where redundancy and mild conflicts destabilize generation. We propose \textbf{Information Gain Pruning (IGP)}, a deployment-friendly reranking-and-pruning module that selects evidence using a generator-aligned utility signal and filters weak or harmful passages before truncation, without changing existing budget interfaces. Across five open-domain QA benchmarks and multiple retrievers and generators, IGP consistently improves the quality--cost trade-off. In a representative multi-evidence setting, IGP delivers about +12--20% relative improvement in average F1 while reducing final-stage input tokens by roughly 76--79% compared to retriever-only baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17532v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reconstructing Training Data from Adapter-based Federated Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17533</link><description>arXiv:2601.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapter-based Federated Large Language Models (FedLLMs) are widely adopted to reduce the computational, storage, and communication overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning for web-scale applications while preserving user privacy. By freezing the backbone and training only compact low-rank adapters, these methods appear to limit gradient leakage and thwart existing Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs).
  Contrary to this assumption, we show that low-rank adapters create new, exploitable leakage channels. We propose the Unordered-word-bag-based Text Reconstruction (UTR) attack, a novel GIA tailored to the unique structure of adapter-based FedLLMs. UTR overcomes three core challenges: low-dimensional gradients, frozen backbones, and combinatorially large reconstruction spaces by: (i) inferring token presence from attention patterns in frozen layers, (ii) performing sentence-level inversion within the low-rank subspace of adapter gradients, and (iii) enforcing semantic coherence through constrained greedy decoding guided by language priors. Extensive experiments across diverse models (GPT2-Large, BERT, Qwen2.5-7B) and datasets (CoLA, SST-2, Rotten Tomatoes) demonstrate that UTR achieves near-perfect reconstruction accuracy (ROUGE-1/2 &gt; 99), even with large batch size settings where prior GIAs fail completely. Our results reveal a fundamental tension between parameter efficiency and privacy in FedLLMs, challenging the prevailing belief that lightweight adaptation inherently enhances security.

Abstract: The AI-native vision of 6G requires Radio Access Networks to train, deploy, and continuously refine thousands of machine learning (ML) models that drive real-time radio network optimization. Although the Open RAN (O-RAN) architecture provides open interfaces and an intelligent control plane, it leaves the life-cycle management of these models unspecified. Consequently, operators still rely on ad-hoc, manual update practices that can neither scale across the heterogeneous, multi-layer stack of Cell-Site, Edge-, Regional-, and Central-Cloud domains, nor across the three O-RAN control loops (real-, near-real-, and non-real-time). We present a self-learning framework that provides an efficient closed-loop version management for an AI-native O-RAN edge. In this framework, training pipelines in the Central/Regional Cloud continuously generate new models, which are cataloged along with their resource footprints, security scores, and accuracy metrics in a shared version repository. An Update Manager consults this repository and applies a self-learning policy to decide when and where each new model version should be promoted into operation. A container orchestrator then realizes these decisions across heterogeneous worker nodes, enabling multiple services (rApps, xApps, and dApps) to obtain improved inference with minimal disruption. Simulation results show that an efficient RL-driven decision-making can guarantee quality of service, bounded latencies while balancing model accuracy, system stability, and resilience.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17534v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Will It Zero-Shot?: Will It Zero-Shot?: Predicting Zero-Shot Classification Performance For Arbitrary Queries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17535</link><description>arXiv:2601.17535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models like CLIP create aligned embedding spaces for text and images, making it possible for anyone to build a visual classifier by simply naming the classes they want to distinguish. However, a model that works well in one domain may fail in another, and non-expert users have no straightforward way to assess whether their chosen VLM will work on their problem. We build on prior work using text-only comparisons to evaluate how well a model works for a given natural language task, and explore approaches that also generate synthetic images relevant to that task to evaluate and refine the prediction of zero-shot accuracy. We show that generated imagery to the baseline text-only scores substantially improves the quality of these predictions. Additionally, it gives a user feedback on the kinds of images that were used to make the assessment. Experiments on standard CLIP benchmark datasets demonstrate that the image-based approach helps users predict, without any labeled examples, whether a VLM will be effective for their application.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OTI: A Model-free and Visually Interpretable Measure of Image Attackability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17536</link><description>arXiv:2601.17536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous success of neural networks, benign images can be corrupted by adversarial perturbations to deceive these models. Intriguingly, images differ in their attackability. Specifically, given an attack configuration, some images are easily corrupted, whereas others are more resistant. Evaluating image attackability has important applications in active learning, adversarial training, and attack enhancement. This prompts a growing interest in developing attackability measures. However, existing methods are scarce and suffer from two major limitations: (1) They rely on a model proxy to provide prior knowledge (e.g., gradients or minimal perturbation) to extract model-dependent image features. Unfortunately, in practice, many task-specific models are not readily accessible. (2) Extracted features characterizing image attackability lack visual interpretability, obscuring their direct relationship with the images. To address these, we propose a novel Object Texture Intensity (OTI), a model-free and visually interpretable measure of image attackability, which measures image attackability as the texture intensity of the image's semantic object. Theoretically, we describe the principles of OTI from the perspectives of decision boundaries as well as the mid- and high-frequency characteristics of adversarial perturbations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OTI is effective and computationally efficient. In addition, our OTI provides the adversarial machine learning community with a visual understanding of attackability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17536v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ethical Risk Assessment of the Data Harnessing Process of LLM supported on Consensus of Well-known Multi-Ethical Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17540</link><description>arXiv:2601.17540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, unlocking unprecedented capabilities in communication, automation, and knowledge generation. However, the ethical implications of LLM development, particularly in data harnessing, remain a critical challenge. Despite widespread discussion about the ethical compliance of LLMs -- especially concerning their data harnessing processes, there remains a notable absence of concrete frameworks to systematically guide or measure the ethical risks involved. In this paper we discuss a potential pathway for building an Ethical Risk Scoring (ERS) system to quantitatively assess the ethical integrity of the data harnessing process for AI systems. This system is based on a set of assessment questions grounded in core ethical principles, which are, in turn, supported by commanding ethical theories. By integrating measurable scoring mechanisms, this approach aims to foster responsible LLM development, balancing technological innovation with ethical accountability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17540v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cognitive Platform Engineering for Autonomous Cloud Operations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17542</link><description>arXiv:2601.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern DevOps practices have accelerated software delivery through automation, CI/CD pipelines, and observability tooling,but these approaches struggle to keep pace with the scale and dynamism of cloud-native systems. As telemetry volume grows and configuration drift increases, traditional, rule-driven automation often results in reactive operations, delayed remediation, and dependency on manual expertise. This paper introduces Cognitive Platform Engineering, a next-generation paradigm that integrates sensing, reasoning, and autonomous action directly into the platform lifecycle. This paper propose a four-plane reference architecture that unifies data collection, intelligent inference, policy-driven orchestration, and human experience layers within a continuous feedback loop. A prototype implementation built with Kubernetes, Terraform, Open Policy Agent, and ML-based anomaly detection demonstrates improvements in mean time to resolution, resource efficiency, and compliance. The results show that embedding intelligence into platform operations enables resilient, self-adjusting, and intent-aligned cloud environments. The paper concludes with research opportunities in reinforcement learning, explainable governance, and sustainable self-managing cloud ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17542v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Push Down Optimization for Distributed Multi Cloud Data Integration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17546</link><description>arXiv:2601.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprises increasingly adopt multi cloud architectures to take advantage of diverse database engines, regional availability, and cost models. In these environments, ETL pipelines must process large, distributed datasets while minimizing latency and transfer cost. Push down optimization, which executes transformation logic within database engines rather than within the ETL tool, has proven highly effective in single cloud systems. However, when applied across multiple clouds, it faces challenges related to data movement, heterogeneous SQL engines, orchestration complexity, and fragmented security controls. This paper examines the feasibility of push down optimization in multi cloud ETL pipelines and analyzes its benefits and limitations. It evaluates localized push down, hybrid models, and data federation techniques that reduce cross cloud traffic while improving performance. A case study across Redshift and BigQuery demonstrates measurable gains, including lower end to end runtime, reduced transfer volume, and improved cost efficiency. The study highlights practical strategies that organizations can adopt to improve ETL scalability and reliability in distributed cloud environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17546v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prompt Injection Attacks on Agentic Coding Assistants: A Systematic Analysis of Vulnerabilities in Skills, Tools, and Protocol Ecosystems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17548</link><description>arXiv:2601.17548v1 Announce Type: new

In this \textbf{Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)} paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of prompt injection attacks targeting agentic coding assistants. We propose a novel three-dimensional taxonomy categorizing attacks across \textit{delivery vectors}, \textit{attack modalities}, and \textit{propagation behaviors}. Our meta-analysis synthesizes findings from 78 recent studies (2021--2026), consolidating evidence that attack success rates against state-of-the-art defenses exceed 85\% when adaptive attack strategies are employed. We systematically catalog 42 distinct attack techniques spanning input manipulation, tool poisoning, protocol exploitation, multimodal injection, and cross-origin context poisoning. Through critical analysis of 18 defense mechanisms reported in prior work, we identify that most achieve less than 50\% mitigation against sophisticated adaptive attacks. We contribute: (1) a unified taxonomy bridging disparate attack classifications, (2) the first systematic analysis of skill-based architecture vulnerabilities with concrete exploit chains, and (3) a defense-in-depth framework grounded in the limitations we identify. Our findings indicate that the security community must treat prompt injection as a first-class vulnerability class requiring architectural-level mitigations rather than ad-hoc filtering approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17548v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking the Protocol: Security Analysis of the Model Context Protocol Specification and Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities in Tool-Integrated LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17549</link><description>arXiv:2601.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a de facto standard for integrating Large Language Models with external tools, yet no formal security analysis of the protocol specification exists. We present the first rigorous security analysis of MCP's architectural design, identifying three fundamental protocol-level vulnerabilities: (1) absence of capability attestation allowing servers to claim arbitrary permissions, (2) bidirectional sampling without origin authentication enabling server-side prompt injection, and (3) implicit trust propagation in multi-server configurations. We implement \textsc{MCPBench}, a novel framework bridging existing agent security benchmarks to MCP-compliant infrastructure, enabling direct measurement of protocol-specific attack surfaces. Through controlled experiments on 847 attack scenarios across five MCP server implementations, we demonstrate that MCP's architectural choices amplify attack success rates by 23--41\% compared to equivalent non-MCP integrations. We propose \textsc{MCPSec}, a backward-compatible protocol extension adding capability attestation and message authentication, reducing attack success rates from 52.8\% to 12.4\% with median latency overhead of 8.3ms per message. Our findings establish that MCP's security weaknesses are architectural rather than implementation-specific, requiring protocol-level remediation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17549v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AsterNav: Autonomous Aerial Robot Navigation In Darkness Using Passive Computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17550</link><description>arXiv:2601.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial navigation in absolute darkness is crucial for post-disaster search and rescue operations, which often occur from disaster-zone power outages. Yet, due to resource constraints, tiny aerial robots, perfectly suited for these operations, are unable to navigate in the darkness to find survivors safely. In this paper, we present an autonomous aerial robot for navigation in the dark by combining an Infra-Red (IR) monocular camera with a large-aperture coded lens and structured light without external infrastructure like GPS or motion-capture. Our approach obtains depth-dependent defocus cues (each structured light point appears as a pattern that is depth dependent), which acts as a strong prior for our AsterNet deep depth estimation model. The model is trained in simulation by generating data using a simple optical model and transfers directly to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining. AsterNet runs onboard the robot at 20 Hz on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin$^\text{TM}$ Nano. Furthermore, our network is robust to changes in the structured light pattern and relative placement of the pattern emitter and IR camera, leading to simplified and cost-effective construction. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate our proposed depth navigation approach AsterNav using depth from AsterNet in many real-world experiments using only onboard sensing and computation, including dark matte obstacles and thin ropes (diameter 6.25mm), achieving an overall success rate of 95.5% with unknown object shapes, locations and materials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on monocular, structured-light-based quadrotor navigation in absolute darkness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17550v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GreenServ: Energy-Efficient Context-Aware Dynamic Routing for Multi-Model LLM Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17551</link><description>arXiv:2601.17551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, but their broad deployment is limited by significant computational resource demands, particularly energy consumption during inference. Static, one-model-fits-all inference strategies are often inefficient, as they do not exploit the diverse range of available models or adapt to varying query requirements.
  This paper presents GreenServ, a dynamic, context-aware routing framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference accuracy and energy efficiency. GreenServ extracts lightweight contextual features from each query, including task type, semantic cluster, and text complexity, and routes queries to the most suitable model from a heterogeneous pool, based on observed accuracy and energy usage. We employ a multi-armed bandit approach to learn adaptive routing policies online. This approach operates under partial feedback, eliminates the need for extensive offline calibration, and streamlines the integration of new models into the inference pipeline.
  We evaluated GreenServ across five benchmark tasks and a pool of 16 contemporary open-access LLMs. Experimental results show that GreenServ consistently outperforms static (single-model) and random baselines. In particular, compared to random routing, GreenServ achieved a 22% increase in accuracy while reducing cumulative energy consumption by 31%. Finally, we evaluated GreenServ with RouterBench, achieving an average accuracy of 71.7% with a peak accuracy of 75.7%.

Abstract: The compression of satellite imagery remains an important research area as hundreds of terabytes of images are collected every day, which drives up storage and bandwidth costs. Although progress has been made in increasing the resolution of these satellite images, many downstream tasks are only interested in small regions of any given image. These areas of interest vary by task but, once known, can be used to optimize how information within the image is encoded. Whereas standard image encoding methods, even those optimized for remote sensing, work on the whole image equally, there are emerging methods that can be guided by saliency maps to focus on important areas. In this work we show how imagery preprocessing techniques driven by saliency maps can be used with traditional lossy compression coding standards to create variable rate image compression within a single large satellite image. Specifically, we use variable sized smoothing kernels that map to different quantized saliency levels to process imagery pixels in order to optimize downstream compression and encoding schemes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17555v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Correct-by-Construction Vision-based Pose Estimation using Geometric Generative Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17556</link><description>arXiv:2601.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based pose estimation for autonomous systems. While deep neural networks have been successfully used for vision-based tasks, they inherently lack provable guarantees on the correctness of their output, which is crucial for safety-critical applications. We present a framework for designing certifiable neural networks (NNs) for perception-based pose estimation that integrates physics-driven modeling with learning-based estimation. The proposed framework begins by leveraging the known geometry of planar objects commonly found in the environment, such as traffic signs and runway markings, referred to as target objects. At its core, it introduces a geometric generative model (GGM), a neural-network-like model whose parameters are derived from the image formation process of a target object observed by a camera. Once designed, the GGM can be used to train NN-based pose estimators with certified guarantees in terms of their estimation errors. We first demonstrate this framework in uncluttered environments, where the target object is the only object present in the camera's field of view. We extend this using ideas from NN reachability analysis to design certified object NN that can detect the presence of the target object in cluttered environments. Subsequently, the framework consolidates the certified object detector with the certified pose estimator to design a multi-stage perception pipeline that generalizes the proposed approach to cluttered environments, while maintaining its certified guarantees. We evaluate the proposed framework using both synthetic and real images of various planar objects commonly encountered by autonomous vehicles. Using images captured by an event-based camera, we show that the trained encoder can effectively estimate the pose of a traffic sign in accordance with the certified bound provided by the framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17556v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Measuring Braking Behavior Using Vehicle Tracking and Camera-to-Satellite Homography Rectification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17558</link><description>arXiv:2601.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an open-source software application for analyzing traffic camera footage, focusing on vehicle behavior and braking events at signalized urban highways. The core innovation is a robust ground-plane homography estimation that links fixed traffic camera views to satellite orthoimagery. This process rectifies the camera's oblique perspective, ensuring that pixel distances accurately represent real-world distances. This enables the acquisition of features such as vehicle trajectory, speed, deceleration, and braking severity without the need for camera calibration. The pipeline employs the MAGSAC++ estimator to build the homography, converting YOLO11 object detections into a rectified top-down coordinate system. All detection and trajectory data are stored in a ClickHouse database for subsequent analysis. A real-world case study at two signalized intersections in Key West, Florida, showcased the system's capabilities. Across two days of daytime footage, braking activity at the higher-volume intersection peaked around 4 PM at approximately 57.5 events per hour, while the second intersection peaked around 10 AM at roughly 15.5 events per hour. The spatial analysis revealed that most braking events initiated upstream, with mild and moderate braking mostly occurring 30 to 45+ meters away from the stop bar and severe braking distributed throughout, but particularly concentrated in lanes with higher interaction and merging activity. The findings highlight the significant potential of this centralized safety information system to support connected vehicles, facilitating proactive traffic management, crash mitigation, and data-driven roadway design and safety analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17558v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Private Iris Recognition with High-Performance FHE</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17561</link><description>arXiv:2601.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among biometric verification systems, irises stand out because they offer high accuracy even in large-scale databases. For example, the World ID project aims to provide authentication to all humans via iris recognition, with millions already registered. Storing such biometric data raises privacy concerns, which can be addressed using privacy-enhancing techniques.
  Bloemen et al. describe a solution based on 2-out-of-3 Secret-Sharing Multiparty Computation (SS-MPC), for the World ID setup. In terms of security, unless an adversary corrupts 2~servers, the iris codes remain confidential and nothing leaks beyond the result of the computation. Their solution is able to match~$32$ users against a database of~$2^{22}$ iris codes in~$\approx 2$s , using~24 H100 GPUs, more than 40~communication rounds and $81$GB/party of data transferred (the timing assumes a network speed above~3Tb/s).
  In the present work, we explore the use of Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (ThFHE) for the same task. The ThFHE solution brings a number of security advantages: no trusted setup, the encrypted database and queries can be public, the secret can be distributed among many parties, and active security can be added without significant performance degradation.
  Our proof-of-concept implementation of the computation phase handles $32$~eyes against a database of $7\cdot 2^{14}$ iris codes in~$\approx 1.8$s ($\approx 0.33s$ for 4 eyes against the same database), using 8 RTX-5090 GPUs. To this, one should add~2 to 3 rounds of communication (depending on deployment choice). We perform the matching using the CKKS (Th)FHE scheme. Our main technical ingredients are the use of recent progress on FHE-based linear algebra boosted using int8 GPU operations, and the introduction of a technique reducing the number of ciphertexts to be processed as early as possible.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17561v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparse RBF Networks for PDEs and nonlocal equations: function space theory, operator calculus, and training algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17562</link><description>arXiv:2601.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a systematic analysis and extension of the sparse radial basis function network (SparseRBFnet) previously introduced for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Based on its adaptive-width shallow kernel network formulation, we further investigate its function-space characterization, operator evaluation, and computational algorithm. We provide a unified description of the solution space for a broad class of radial basis functions (RBFs). Under mild assumptions, this space admits a characterization as a Besov space, independent of the specific kernel choice. We further demonstrate how the explicit kernel-based structure enables quasi-analytical evaluation of both differential and nonlocal operators, including fractional Laplacians. On the computational end, we study the adaptive-width network and related three-phase training strategy through a comparison with variants concerning the modeling and algorithmic details. In particular, we assess the roles of second-order optimization, inner-weight training, network adaptivity, and anisotropic kernel parameterizations. Numerical experiments on high-order, fractional, and anisotropic PDE benchmarks illustrate the empirical insensitivity to kernel choice, as well as the resulting trade-offs between accuracy, sparsity, and computational cost. Collectively, these results consolidate and generalize the theoretical and computational framework of SparseRBFnet, supporting accurate sparse representations with efficient operator evaluation and offering theory-grounded guidance for algorithmic and modeling choices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17562v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Generalisable Imitation Learning Through Conditioned Transition Estimation and Online Behaviour Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17563</link><description>arXiv:2601.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art imitation learning from observation methods (ILfO) have recently made significant progress, but they still have some limitations: they need action-based supervised optimisation, assume that states have a single optimal action, and tend to apply teacher actions without full consideration of the actual environment state. While the truth may be out there in observed trajectories, existing methods struggle to extract it without supervision. In this work, we propose Unsupervised Imitation Learning from Observation (UfO) that addresses all of these limitations. UfO learns a policy through a two-stage process, in which the agent first obtains an approximation of the teacher's true actions in the observed state transitions, and then refines the learned policy further by adjusting agent trajectories to closely align them with the teacher's. Experiments we conducted in five widely used environments show that UfO not only outperforms the teacher and all other ILfO methods but also displays the smallest standard deviation. This reduction in standard deviation indicates better generalisation in unseen scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17563v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] JaxARC: A High-Performance JAX-based Environment for Abstraction and Reasoning Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17564</link><description>arXiv:2601.17564v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve complex reasoning tasks is a key step toward artificial general intelligence. Recent work augments LLMs with external tools to enable agentic reasoning, achieving high utility and efficiency in a plug-and-play manner. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of such methods to malicious manipulation of the tool-calling process remain largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a tool-specific attack surface and propose Sponge Tool Attack (STA), which disrupts agentic reasoning solely by rewriting the input prompt under a strict query-only access assumption. Without any modification on the underlying model or the external tools, STA converts originally concise and efficient reasoning trajectories into unnecessarily verbose and convoluted ones before arriving at the final answer. This results in substantial computational overhead while remaining stealthy by preserving the original task semantics and user intent. To achieve this, we design STA as an iterative, multi-agent collaborative framework with explicit rewritten policy control, and generates benign-looking prompt rewrites from the original one with high semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across 6 models (including both open-source models and closed-source APIs), 12 tools, 4 agentic frameworks, and 13 datasets spanning 5 domains validate the effectiveness of STA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17566v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time Trend Prediction via Continually-Aligned LLM Query Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17567</link><description>arXiv:2601.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trending news detection in low-traffic search environments faces a fundamental cold-start problem, where a lack of query volume prevents systems from identifying emerging or long-tail trends. Existing methods relying on keyword frequency or query spikes are inherently slow and ineffective in these sparse settings, lagging behind real-world shifts in attention. We introduce RTTP, a novel Real-Time Trending Prediction framework that generates search queries directly from news content instead of waiting for users to issue them. RTTP leverages a continual learning LLM (CL-LLM) that converts posts into search-style queries and scores them using engagement strength + creator authority, enabling early trend surfacing before search volume forms. To ensure adaptation without degrading reasoning, we propose Mix-Policy DPO, a new preference-based continual learning approach that combines on-policy stability with off-policy novelty to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during model upgrades. Deployed at production scale on Facebook and Meta AI products, RTTP delivers +91.4% improvement in tail-trend detection precision@500 and +19% query generation accuracy over industry baselines, while sustaining stable performance after multi-week online training. This work demonstrates that LLM-generated synthetic search signals, when aligned and continually updated, unlock timely trend understanding in low-traffic search environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17567v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving User Privacy in Personalized Generation: Client-Side Retrieval-Augmented Modification of Server-Side Generated Speculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17569</link><description>arXiv:2601.17569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalization is crucial for aligning Large Language Model (LLM) outputs with individual user preferences and background knowledge. State-of-the-art solutions are based on retrieval augmentation, where relevant context from a user profile is retrieved for LLM consumption. These methods deal with a trade-off between exposing retrieved private data to cloud providers and relying on less capable local models. We introduce $P^3$, an interactive framework for high-quality personalization without revealing private profiles to server-side LLMs. In $P^3$, a large server-side model generates a sequence of $k$ draft tokens based solely on the user query, while a small client-side model, with retrieval access to the user's private profile, evaluates and modifies these drafts to better reflect user preferences. This process repeats until an end token is generated. Experiments on LaMP-QA, a recent benchmark consisting of three personalized question answering datasets, show that $P^3$ consistently outperforms both non-personalized server-side and personalized client-side baselines, achieving statistically significant improvements of $7.4%$ to $9%$ on average. Importantly, $P^3$ recovers $90.3%$ to $95.7%$ of the utility of a ``leaky'' upper-bound scenario in which the full profile is exposed to the large server-side model. Privacy analyses, including linkability and attribute inference attacks, indicate that $P^3$ preserves the privacy of a non-personalized server-side model, introducing only marginal additional leakage ($1.5%$--$3.5%$) compared to submitting a query without any personal context. Additionally, the framework is efficient for edge deployment, with the client-side model generating only $9.2%$ of the total tokens. These results demonstrate that $P^3$ provides a practical, effective solution for personalized generation with improved privacy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17569v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum-Inspired Episode Selection for Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning via QUBO Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17570</link><description>arXiv:2601.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) reinforcement learning suffers from high sample complexity, especially in environments with sparse rewards, large state spaces, and correlated trajectories. We address these limitations by reformulating episode selection as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and solving it with quantum-inspired samplers. Our method, MC+QUBO, integrates a combinatorial filtering step into standard MC policy evaluation: from each batch of trajectories, we select a subset that maximizes cumulative reward while promoting state-space coverage. This selection is encoded as a QUBO, where linear terms favor high-reward episodes and quadratic terms penalize redundancy. We explore both Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) and Simulated Bifurcation (SB) as black-box solvers within this framework. Experiments in a finite-horizon GridWorld demonstrate that MC+QUBO outperforms vanilla MC in convergence speed and final policy quality, highlighting the potential of quantum-inspired optimization as a decision-making subroutine in reinforcement learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17570v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Split Algorithm in Linear Time for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery and Time Windows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17572</link><description>arXiv:2601.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many kinds of vehicle routing problems (VRPs), a popular heuristic approach involves constructing a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution, referred to as a long tour, then partitioning segments of the solution into routes for different vehicles with respect to problem constraints. Previously, a Split algorithm with a worst-case runtime of $\Theta(n)$ was proposed for the capacitated VRP (CVRP) that finds the most cost-efficient partition of customers, given a long tour. This was an improvement over the previously fastest-known Split algorithm with a worst-case runtime of $\Theta(n^2)$ that was based on Bellman's shortest path algorithm. While this linear Split has been an integral part of modern state-of-the-art CVRP approaches, little progress has been made in extending this algorithm to handle additional VRP variants, limiting the general applicability of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an extension of the linear Split that handles two cardinal VRP variants simultaneously: (i) simultaneous pickups and deliveries (VRPSPD) and (ii) time windows (VRPTW). The resulting $\Theta(n)$ algorithm is guaranteed to be optimal, assuming travel times between nodes satisfy the triangle inequality. Additionally, we extend the linear Split to handle a capacity penalty for the VRPSPD. For the VRPTW, we extend the linear Split to handle the CVRP capacity penalty in conjunction with the popular time warp penalty function. Computational experiments are performed to empirically validate the speed gains of these linear Splits against their $\Theta$($n^2$) counterparts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17572v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Status Hierarchies in Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17577</link><description>arXiv:2601.17577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From school playgrounds to corporate boardrooms, status hierarchies -- rank orderings based on respect and perceived competence -- are universal features of human social organization. Language models trained on human-generated text inevitably encounter these hierarchical patterns embedded in language, raising the question of whether they might reproduce such dynamics in multi-agent settings. This thesis investigates when and how language models form status hierarchies by adapting Berger et al.'s (1972) expectation states framework. I create multi-agent scenarios where separate language model instances complete sentiment classification tasks, are introduced with varying status characteristics (e.g., credentials, expertise), then have opportunities to revise their initial judgments after observing their partner's responses. The dependent variable is deference, the rate at which models shift their ratings toward their partner's position based on status cues rather than task information. Results show that language models form significant status hierarchies when capability is equal (35 percentage point asymmetry, p &lt; .001), but capability differences dominate status cues, with the most striking effect being that high-status assignments reduce higher-capability models' deference rather than increasing lower-capability models' deference. The implications for AI safety are significant: status-seeking behavior could introduce deceptive strategies, amplify discriminatory biases, and scale across distributed deployments far faster than human hierarchies form organically. This work identifies emergent social behaviors in AI systems and highlights a previously underexplored dimension of the alignment challenge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17577v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Approach to Concurrent, Parallel Map-Reduce in R using Futures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17578</link><description>arXiv:2601.17578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R ecosystem offers a rich variety of map-reduce application programming interfaces (APIs) for iterative computations, yet parallelizing code across these diverse frameworks requires learning multiple, often incompatible, parallel APIs. The futurize package addresses this challenge by providing a single function, futurize(), which transpiles sequential map-reduce expressions into their parallel equivalents in the future ecosystem, which performs all the heavy lifting. By leveraging R's native pipe operator, users can parallelize existing code with minimal refactoring -- often by simply appending `|&gt; futurize()' to an expression. The package supports classical map-reduce functions from base R, purrr, crossmap, foreach, plyr, BiocParallel, e.g., lapply(xs, fcn) |&gt; futurize() and map(xs, fcn) |&gt; futurize(), as well as a growing set of domain-specific packages, e.g., boot, caret, glmnet, lme4, mgcv, and tm. By abstracting away the underlying parallel machinery, and unifying handling of future options, the package enables developers to declare what to parallelize via futurize(), and end-users to choose how via plan(). This article describes the philosophy, design, and implementation of futurize, demonstrates its usage across various map-reduce paradigms, and discusses its role in simplifying parallel computing in R.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17578v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How AI Coding Agents Modify Code: A Large-Scale Study of GitHub Pull Requests</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17581</link><description>arXiv:2601.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI coding agents are increasingly acting as autonomous contributors by generating and submitting pull requests (PRs).

Understanding these differences is essential for assessing their reliability and impact on development workflows. Using the MSR 2026 Mining Challenge version of the AIDev dataset, we analyze 24,014 merged Agentic PRs (440,295 commits) and 5,081 merged Human PRs (23,242 commits). We examine additions, deletions, commits, and files touched, and evaluate the consistency between PR descriptions and their diffs using lexical and semantic similarity. Agentic PRs differ substantially from Human PRs in commit count (Cliff's $\delta = 0.5429$) and show moderate differences in files touched and deleted lines. They also exhibit slightly higher description-to-diff similarity across all measures. These findings provide a large-scale empirical characterization of how AI coding agents contribute to open source development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17581v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prompt Driven Development with Claude Code: Building a Complete TUI Framework for the Ring Programming Language</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17584</link><description>arXiv:2601.17584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in software development, yet their ability to generate and maintain large, multi module systems through natural language interaction remains insufficiently characterized. This study presents an empirical analysis of developing a 7420 line Terminal User Interface framework for the Ring programming language, completed in roughly ten hours of active work spread across three days using a purely prompt driven workflow with Claude Code, Opus 4.5. The system was produced through 107 prompts: 21 feature requests, 72 bug fix prompts, 9 prompts sharing information from Ring documentation, 4 prompts providing architectural guidance, and 1 prompt dedicated to generating documentation. Development progressed across five phases, with the Window Manager phase requiring the most interaction, followed by complex UI systems and controls expansion. Bug related prompts covered redraw issues, event handling faults, runtime errors, and layout inconsistencies, while feature requests focused primarily on new widgets, window manager capabilities, and advanced UI components. Most prompts were short, reflecting a highly iterative workflow in which the human role was limited to specifying requirements, validating behaviour, and issuing corrective prompts without writing any code manually. The resulting framework includes a complete windowing subsystem, event driven architecture, interactive widgets, hierarchical menus, grid and tree components, tab controls, and a multi window desktop environment. By combining quantitative prompt analysis with qualitative assessment of model behaviour, this study provides empirical evidence that modern LLMs can sustain architectural coherence and support the construction of production grade tooling for emerging programming languages, highlighting prompt driven development as a viable methodology within software engineering practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17584v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sequence Repetition Enhances Token Embeddings and Improves Sequence Labeling with Decoder-only Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17585</link><description>arXiv:2601.17585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) are trained in an autoregressive manner, conditioned only on the prefix. In contrast, sequence labeling (SL) tasks assign labels to each individual input token, naturally benefiting from bidirectional context. This discrepancy has historically led SL to rely on inherently bidirectional encoder-only models. However, the rapid development of decoder-only models has raised the question of whether they can be adapted to SL. While causal mask removal has emerged as a viable technique for adapting decoder-only models to leverage the full context for SL, it requires considerable changes to the base model functionality. In this work, we explore sequence repetition (SR) as a less invasive alternative for enabling bidirectionality in decoder-only models. Through fine-tuning experiments, we show that SR inherently makes decoders bidirectional, improving the quality of token-level embeddings and surpassing encoders and unmasked decoders. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that increasing the number of repetitions does not degrade SL performance. Finally, we demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers are highly effective for SR, comparable to those from final layers, while being significantly more efficient to compute. Our findings underscore that SR alleviates the structural limitations of decoders, enabling more efficient and adaptable LMs and broadening their applicability to other token-level tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17585v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stylizing ViT: Anatomy-Preserving Instance Style Transfer for Domain Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17586</link><description>arXiv:2601.17586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models in medical image analysis often struggle with generalizability across domains and demographic groups due to data heterogeneity and scarcity. Traditional augmentation improves robustness, but fails under substantial domain shifts. Recent advances in stylistic augmentation enhance domain generalization by varying image styles but fall short in terms of style diversity or by introducing artifacts into the generated images. To address these limitations, we propose Stylizing ViT, a novel Vision Transformer encoder that utilizes weight-shared attention blocks for both self- and cross-attention. This design allows the same attention block to maintain anatomical consistency through self-attention while performing style transfer via cross-attention. We assess the effectiveness of our method for domain generalization by employing it for data augmentation on three distinct image classification tasks in the context of histopathology and dermatology. Results demonstrate an improved robustness (up to +13% accuracy) over the state of the art while generating perceptually convincing images without artifacts. Additionally, we show that Stylizing ViT is effective beyond training, achieving a 17% performance improvement during inference when used for test-time augmentation.

Abstract: Configuring the parameters of additive manufacturing processes for metal alloys is a challenging problem due to complex relationships between input parameters (e.g., laser power, scan speed) and quality of printed outputs. The standard trial-and-error approach to find feasible parameter configurations is highly inefficient because validating each configuration is expensive in terms of resources (physical and human labor) and the configuration space is very large. This paper combines the general principles of AI-driven adaptive experimental design with domain knowledge to address the challenging problem of discovering feasible configurations. The key idea is to build a surrogate model from past experiments to intelligently select a small batch of input configurations for validation in each iteration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, we deploy it for Directed Energy Deposition process to print GRCop--42, a high-performance copper--chromium--niobium alloy developed by NASA for aerospace applications. Within three months, our approach yielded multiple defect-free outputs across a range of laser powers dramatically reducing time to result and resource expenditure compared to several months of manual experimentation by domain scientists with no success. By enabling high-quality GRCop--42 fabrication on readily available infrared laser platforms for the first time, we democratize access to this critical alloy, paving the way for cost-effective, decentralized production for aerospace applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17587v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Intelligence Requires Grounding But Not Embodiment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17588</link><description>arXiv:2601.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have reignited scientific debate over whether embodiment is necessary for intelligence. We present the argument that intelligence requires grounding, a phenomenon entailed by embodiment, but not embodiment itself. We define intelligence as the possession of four properties -- motivation, predictive ability, understanding of causality, and learning from experience -- and argue that each can be achieved by a non-embodied, grounded agent. We use this to conclude that grounding, not embodiment, is necessary for intelligence. We then present a thought experiment of an intelligent LLM agent in a digital environment and address potential counterarguments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17588v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lightspeed Data Compute for the Space Era</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17589</link><description>arXiv:2601.17589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While thousands of satellites photograph Earth every day, most of that data never makes it to the ground because downlink bandwidth simply cannot keep up. Processing data in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) zone offers promising capabilities to overcome this limitation. We propose SpaceCoMP, a MapReduce-inspired processing model for LEO satellite mesh networks. Ground stations submit queries over an area of interest; satellites collect sensor data, process it cooperatively at light-speed using inter-satellite laser links, and return only the results. Our compute model leverages space physics to accelerate computations on LEO megaconstellations. Our distance-aware routing protocol exploits orbital geometry. In addition, our bipartite match scheduling strategy places map and reduce tasks within orbital regions while minimizing aggregation costs. We have simulated constellations of 1,000-10,000 satellites showcasing 61-79% improvement in map placement efficiency over baselines, 18-28% over greedy allocation, and 67-72% reduction in aggregation cost. SpaceCoMP demonstrates that the orbital mesh is not merely useful as a communication relay, as seen today, but can provide the foundations for faster data processing above the skies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Chains to DAGs: Probing the Graph Structure of Reasoning in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17593</link><description>arXiv:2601.17593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models has renewed interest in mechanistically characterizing how multi-step reasoning is represented and computed. While much prior work treats reasoning as a linear chain of steps, many reasoning problems are more naturally structured as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where intermediate conclusions may depend on multiple premises, branch into parallel sub-derivations, and later merge or be reused. Understanding whether such graph-structured reasoning is reflected in model internals remains an open question.
  In this work, we introduce Reasoning DAG Probing, a framework that directly asks whether LLM hidden states encode the geometry of a reasoning DAG in a linearly accessible form, and where this structure emerges across layers. Within this framework, we associate each reasoning node with a textual realization and train lightweight probes to predict two graph-theoretic properties from hidden states: node depth and pairwise node distance. We use these probes to analyze the layerwise emergence of DAG structure and evaluate controls that disrupt reasoning-relevant structure while preserving superficial textual properties. Our results provide evidence that reasoning DAG geometry is meaningfully encoded in intermediate layers, with recoverability varying systematically by node depth and model scale, suggesting that LLM reasoning is not only sequential but exhibits measurable internal graph structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17593v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Ideate for Machine Learning Engineering Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17596</link><description>arXiv:2601.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing machine learning engineering (MLE) agents struggle to iteratively optimize their implemented algorithms for effectiveness. To address this, we introduce MLE-Ideator, a dual-agent framework that separates ideation from implementation. In our system, an implementation agent can request strategic help from a dedicated Ideator. We show this approach is effective in two ways. First, in a training-free setup, our framework significantly outperforms implementation-only agent baselines on MLE-Bench. Second, we demonstrate that the Ideator can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate more effective ideas. With only 1K training samples from 10 MLE tasks, our RL-trained Qwen3-8B Ideator achieves an 11.5% relative improvement compared to its untrained counterpart and surpasses Claude Sonnet 3.5. These results highlights a promising path toward training strategic AI systems for scientific discovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17596v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Intrinsic Surprise-Regularized Control (DISRC): A Biologically Inspired Mechanism for Efficient Deep Q-Learning in Sparse Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17598</link><description>arXiv:2601.17598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has driven major advances in autonomous control. Still, standard Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents tend to rely on fixed learning rates and uniform update scaling, even as updates are modulated by temporal-difference (TD) error. This rigidity destabilizes convergence, especially in sparse-reward settings where feedback is infrequent. We introduce Deep Intrinsic Surprise-Regularized Control (DISRC), a biologically inspired augmentation to DQN that dynamically scales Q-updates based on latent-space surprise. DISRC encodes states via a LayerNorm-based encoder and computes a deviation-based surprise score relative to a moving latent setpoint. Each update is then scaled in proportion to both TD error and surprise intensity, promoting plasticity during early exploration and stability as familiarity increases. We evaluate DISRC on two sparse-reward MiniGrid environments, which included MiniGrid-DoorKey-8x8 and MiniGrid-LavaCrossingS9N1, under identical settings as a vanilla DQN baseline. In DoorKey, DISRC reached the first successful episode (reward &gt; 0.8) 33% faster than the vanilla DQN baseline (79 vs. 118 episodes), with lower reward standard deviation (0.25 vs. 0.34) and higher reward area under the curve (AUC: 596.42 vs. 534.90). These metrics reflect faster, more consistent learning - critical for sparse, delayed reward settings. In LavaCrossing, DISRC achieved a higher final reward (0.95 vs. 0.93) and the highest AUC of all agents (957.04), though it converged more gradually. These preliminary results establish DISRC as a novel mechanism for regulating learning intensity in off-policy agents, improving both efficiency and stability in sparse-reward domains. By treating surprise as an intrinsic learning signal, DISRC enables agents to modulate updates based on expectation violations, enhancing decision quality when conventional value-based methods fall short.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17598v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why They Link: An Intent Taxonomy for Including Hyperlinks in Social Posts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17601</link><description>arXiv:2601.17601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: URLs serve as bridges between social media platforms and the broader web, linking user-generated content to external information resources. On Twitter (X), approximately one in five tweets contains at least one URL, underscoring their central role in information dissemination. While prior studies have examined the motivations of authors who share URLs, such author-centered intentions are difficult to observe in practice. To enable broader downstream use, this work investigates reader-centered interpretations, i.e., how users perceive the intentions behind hyperlinks included in posts. We develop an intent taxonomy for including hyperlinks in social posts through a hybrid approach that begins with a bottom-up, data-driven process using large-scale crowdsourced annotations, and is then refined using large language model assistance to generate descriptive category names and precise definitions. The final taxonomy comprises 6 top-level categories and 26 fine-grained intention classes, capturing diverse communicative purposes. Applying this taxonomy, we annotate and analyze 1000 user posts, revealing that advertising, arguing, and sharing are the most prevalent intentions. This resulting taxonomy provides a foundation for intent-aware information retrieval and NLP applications, enabling more accurate retrieval, recommendation, and understanding of social media content.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17601v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Transformer Encoder-Decoder Representations through Bernoulli Dropout</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17602</link><description>arXiv:2601.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Transformer overparameterization through the lens of angular similarity in high-dimensional encoder-decoder embeddings. We apply Bernoulli dropout between the encoder and the decoder, varying the keep probability $p$ to identify a sparsity-dependent threshold above which the Top-1 prediction is preserved. Theoretically, we prove that, if the effective sparsity embeddings is sufficiently large, and thus decoder performance, remain stable under moderate coordinate dropout. Empirically, we implement the Bernoulli dropout by constructing a new Transformer model augmented with Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and test its performance on an English-French translation task. Experimental results visualize the trends for validation accuracies and BLEU scores, both decline sharply at some threshold.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17602v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human-Aligned Enhancement of Programming Answers with LLMs Guided by User Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17604</link><description>arXiv:2601.17604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support software developers in tasks such as code generation, optimization, and documentation. However, their ability to improve existing programming answers in a human-like manner remains underexplored. On technical question-and-answer platforms such as Stack Overflow (SO), contributors often revise answers based on user comments that identify errors, inefficiencies, or missing explanations. Yet roughly one-third of this feedback is never addressed due to limited time, expertise, or visibility, leaving many answers incomplete or outdated. This study investigates whether LLMs can enhance programming answers by interpreting and incorporating comment-based feedback. We make four main contributions. First, we introduce ReSOlve, a benchmark consisting of 790 SO answers with associated comment threads, annotated for improvement-related and general feedback. Second, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to identify actionable concerns, finding that DeepSeek achieves the best balance between precision and recall. Third, we present AUTOCOMBAT, an LLM-powered tool that improves programming answers by jointly leveraging user comments and question context. Compared to human revised references, AUTOCOMBAT produces near-human quality improvements while preserving the original intent and significantly outperforming the baseline. Finally, a user study with 58 practitioners shows strong practical value, with 84.5 percent indicating they would adopt or recommend the tool. Overall, AUTOCOMBAT demonstrates the potential of scalable, feedback-driven answer refinement to improve the reliability and trustworthiness of technical knowledge platforms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17604v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Thermodynamic Theory of Learning I: Irreversible Ensemble Transport and Epistemic Costs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17607</link><description>arXiv:2601.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning systems acquire structured internal representations from data, yet classical information-theoretic results state that deterministic transformations do not increase information. This raises a fundamental question: how can learning produce abstraction and insight without violating information-theoretic limits?
  We argue that learning is inherently an irreversible process when performed over finite time, and that the realization of epistemic structure necessarily incurs entropy production. To formalize this perspective, we model learning as a transport process in the space of probability distributions over model configurations and introduce an epistemic free-energy framework.
  Within this framework, we define the free-energy drop as a bookkeeping quantity that records the total reduction of epistemic free energy along a learning trajectory. This reduction decomposes into a reversible component associated with potential improvement and an irreversible component corresponding to entropy production.
  We then derive the Epistemic Speed Limit (ESL), a finite-time inequality that lower-bounds the minimal entropy production required by any learning process to realize a given distributional transformation. This bound depends only on the Wasserstein distance between initial and final ensemble distributions and is independent of the specific learning algorithm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17607v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Home Health System Deployment Experience for Geriatric Care Remote Monitoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17608</link><description>arXiv:2601.17608v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: In domains like medicine and finance, large-scale labeled data is costly and often unavailable, leading to models trained on small datasets that struggle to generalize to real-world populations. Large language models contain extensive knowledge from years of research across these domains. We propose LoID (Logit-Informed Distributions), a deterministic method for extracting informative prior distributions for Bayesian logistic regression by directly accessing their token-level predictions. Rather than relying on generated text, we probe the model's confidence in opposing semantic directions (positive vs. negative impact) through carefully constructed sentences. By measuring how consistently the LLM favors one direction across diverse phrasings, we extract the strength and reliability of the model's belief about each feature's influence. We evaluate LoID on ten real-world tabular datasets under synthetic out-of-distribution (OOD) settings characterized by covariate shift, where the training data represents only a subset of the population. We compare our approach against (1) standard uninformative priors, (2) AutoElicit, a recent method that prompts LLMs to generate priors via text completions, (3) LLMProcesses, a method that uses LLMs to generate numerical predictions through in-context learning and (4) an oracle-style upper bound derived from fitting logistic regression on the full dataset. We assess performance using Area Under the Curve (AUC). Across datasets, LoID significantly improves performance over logistic regression trained on OOD data, recovering up to \textbf{59\%} of the performance gap relative to the oracle model. LoID outperforms AutoElicit and LLMProcessesc on 8 out of 10 datasets, while providing a reproducible and computationally efficient mechanism for integrating LLM knowledge into Bayesian inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17609v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AlignUI: A Method for Designing LLM-Generated UIs Aligned with User Preferences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17614</link><description>arXiv:2601.17614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing user interfaces that align with user preferences is a time-consuming process, which requires iterative cycles of prototyping, user testing, and refinement. Recent advancements in LLM-based UI generation have enabled efficient UI generation to assist the UI design process. We introduce AlignUI, a method that aligns LLM-generated UIs with user tasks and preferences by using a user preference dataset to guide the LLM's reasoning process. The dataset was crowdsourced from 50 general users (the target users of generated UIs) and contained 720 UI control preferences on eight image-editing tasks. We evaluated AlignUI by generating UIs for six unseen tasks and conducting a user study with 72 additional general users. The results showed that the generated UIs closely align with multiple dimensions of user preferences. We conclude by discussing the applicability of our method to support user-aligned UI design for multiple task domains and user groups, as well as personalized user needs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17614v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Athena: Synergizing Data Prefetching and Off-Chip Prediction via Online Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17615</link><description>arXiv:2601.17615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prefetching and off-chip prediction are two techniques proposed to hide long memory access latencies in high-performance processors. In this work, we demonstrate that: (1) prefetching and off-chip prediction often provide complementary performance benefits, yet (2) naively combining them often fails to realize their full performance potential, and (3) existing prefetcher control policies leave significant room for performance improvement behind.
  Our goal is to design a holistic framework that can autonomously learn to coordinate an off-chip predictor with multiple prefetchers employed at various cache levels. To this end, we propose a new technique called Athena, which models the coordination between prefetchers and off-chip predictor (OCP) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Athena acts as the RL agent that observes multiple system-level features (e.g., prefetcher/OCP accuracy, bandwidth usage) over an epoch of program execution, and uses them as state information to select a coordination action (i.e., enabling the prefetcher and/or OCP, and adjusting prefetcher aggressiveness). At the end of every epoch, Athena receives a numerical reward that measures the change in multiple system-level metrics (e.g., number of cycles taken to execute an epoch). Athena uses this reward to autonomously and continuously learn a policy to coordinate prefetchers with OCP.
  Our extensive evaluation using a diverse set of memory-intensive workloads shows that Athena consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art coordination policies across a wide range of system configurations with various combinations of underlying prefetchers, OCPs, and main memory bandwidths, while incurring only modest storage overhead.

Abstract: Continual learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by the plasticity-stability dilemma, where acquiring new capabilities often leads to catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. Existing methods typically treat parameters uniformly, failing to distinguish between specific task knowledge and shared capabilities. We introduce Mixture of Sparse Experts for Task-Agnostic Continual Learning, referred to as SETA, a framework that resolves the plasticity-stability conflict by decomposing the model into modular subspaces. Unlike standard updates, where tasks compete for the same parameters, SETA separates knowledge into unique experts, designed to isolate task-specific patterns, and shared experts, responsible for capturing common features. This structure is maintained through elastic weight anchoring, which protects critical shared knowledge and enables a unified gating network to automatically retrieve the correct expert combination for each task during inference. Extensive experiments across diverse domain-specific and general benchmarks demonstrate that SETA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning-based continual learning methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17616v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Search in the Wild: Intents and Trajectory Dynamics from 14M+ Real Search Requests</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17617</link><description>arXiv:2601.17617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-powered search agents are increasingly being used for multi-step information seeking tasks, yet the IR community lacks empirical understanding of how agentic search sessions unfold and how retrieved evidence is used. This paper presents a large-scale log analysis of agentic search based on 14.44M search requests (3.97M sessions) collected from DeepResearchGym, i.e. an open-source search API accessed by external agentic clients. We sessionize the logs, assign session-level intents and step-wise query-reformulation labels using LLM-based annotation, and propose Context-driven Term Adoption Rate (CTAR) to quantify whether newly introduced query terms are traceable to previously retrieved evidence. Our analyses reveal distinctive behavioral patterns. First, over 90% of multi-turn sessions contain at most ten steps, and 89% of inter-step intervals fall under one minute. Second, behavior varies by intent. Fact-seeking sessions exhibit high repetition that increases over time, while sessions requiring reasoning sustain broader exploration. Third, agents reuse evidence across steps. On average, 54% of newly introduced query terms appear in the accumulated evidence context, with contributions from earlier steps beyond the most recent retrieval. The findings suggest that agentic search may benefit from repetition-aware early stopping, intent-adaptive retrieval budgets, and explicit cross-step context tracking. We plan to release the anonymized logs to support future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17617v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reconstructing Protected Biometric Templates from Binary Authentication Results</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17620</link><description>arXiv:2601.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biometric data is considered to be very private and highly sensitive. As such, many methods for biometric template protection were considered over the years -- from biohashing and specially crafted feature extraction procedures, to the use of cryptographic solutions such as Fuzzy Commitments or the use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).
  A key question that arises is how much protection these solutions can offer when the adversary can inject samples, and observe the outputs of the system. While for systems that return the similarity score, one can use attacks such as hill-climbing, for systems where the adversary can only learn whether the authentication attempt was successful, this question remained open.
  In this paper, we show that it is indeed possible to reconstruct the biometric template by just observing the success/failure of the authentication attempt (given the ability to inject a sufficient amount of templates). Our attack achieves negligible template reconstruction loss and enables full recovery of facial images through a generative inversion method, forming a pipeline from binary scores to high-resolution facial images that successfully pass the system more than 98\% of the time. Our results, of course, are applicable for any protection mechanism that maintains the accuracy of the recognition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17620v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Memento: Towards Proactive Visualization of Everyday Memories with Personal Wearable AR Assistant</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17622</link><description>arXiv:2601.17622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Memento, a conversational AR assistant that permanently captures and memorizes user's verbal queries alongside their spatiotemporal and activity contexts. By storing these "memories," Memento discovers connections between users' recurring interests and the contexts that trigger them. Upon detection of similar or identical spatiotemporal activity, Memento proactively recalls user interests and delivers up-to-date responses through AR, seamlessly integrating AR experience into their daily routine. Unlike prior work, each interaction in Memento is not a transient event, but a connected series of interactions with coherent long--term perspective, tailored to the user's broader multimodal (visual, spatial, temporal, and embodied) context. We conduct preliminary evaluation through user feedbacks with participants of diverse expertise in immersive apps, and explore the value of proactive context-aware AR assistant in everyday settings. We share our findings and challenges in designing a proactive, context-aware AR system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17622v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BrainDistill: Implantable Motor Decoding with Task-Specific Knowledge Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17625</link><description>arXiv:2601.17625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based neural decoders with large parameter counts, pre-trained on large-scale datasets, have recently outperformed classical machine learning models and small neural networks on brain-computer interface (BCI) tasks. However, their large parameter counts and high computational demands hinder deployment in power-constrained implantable systems. To address this challenge, we introduce BrainDistill, a novel implantable motor decoding pipeline that integrates an implantable neural decoder (IND) with a task-specific knowledge distillation (TSKD) framework. Unlike standard feature distillation methods that attempt to preserve teacher representations in full, TSKD explicitly prioritizes features critical for decoding through supervised projection. Across multiple neural datasets, IND consistently outperforms prior neural decoders on motor decoding tasks, while its TSKD-distilled variant further surpasses alternative distillation methods in few-shot calibration settings. Finally, we present a quantization-aware training scheme that enables integer-only inference with activation clipping ranges learned during training. The quantized IND enables deployment under the strict power constraints of implantable BCIs with minimal performance loss.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17625v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Code Change Characteristics and Description Alignment: A Comparative Study of Agentic versus Human Pull Requests</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17627</link><description>arXiv:2601.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI coding agents can autonomously generate pull requests (PRs), yet little is known about how their contributions compare to those of humans. We analyze 33,596 agent-generated PRs (APRs) and 6,618 human PRs (HPRs) to compare code-change characteristics and message quality. We observe that APR-introduced symbols (functions and classes) are removed much sooner than those in HPRs (median time to removal 3 vs. 34 days) and are also removed more often (symbol churn 7.33% vs. 4.10%), reflecting a focus on other tasks like documentation and test updates. Agents generate stronger commit-level messages (semantic similarity 0.72 vs. 0.68) but lag humans at PR-level summarization (PR-commit similarity 0.86 vs. 0.88). Commit message length is the best predictor of description quality, indicating reliance on individual commits over full-PR reasoning. These findings highlight a gap between agents' micro-level precision and macro-level communication, suggesting opportunities to improve agent-driven development workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17627v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Representative Litigation Settlement Agreements in Artificial Intelligence Copyright Infringement Disputes: A Comparative Reflection Based on the U.S</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17631</link><description>arXiv:2601.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-density, decentralized copyright conflicts triggered by generative AI training require more than ad hoc solutions; they demand structural governance tools. This article argues that representative litigation settlement agreements offer a distinct institutional advantage. Beyond reducing the transaction costs associated with the "tragedy of the anticommons," these agreements generate market-visible evidence, specifically pricing signals and licensing practices, that validate the "potential market" under the fourth factor of fair use. This phenomenon constitutes procedural market-making. Through a comparative analysis of the U.S. Bartz class action settlement, this study reveals a dual motivation: a surface-level drive for risk aversion and remedy locking, and a deeper logic of constructing a training-licensing market. In the context of Chinese law, the feasibility of such agreements depends not on replicating foreign models, but on establishing three interpretive mechanisms: expanding the functional definition of "same category" claims; adopting a hybrid registration/confirmation system for indeterminate class membership; and converting the "consent" requirement under Article 57, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Procedure Law into a workable opt-out right subject to judicial scrutiny.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17631v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conduit: Programmer-Transparent Near-Data Processing Using Multiple Compute-Capable Resources in Solid State Drives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17633</link><description>arXiv:2601.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state drives (SSDs) are well suited for near-data processing (NDP) because they: (1) store large application datasets, and (2) support three NDP paradigms: in-storage processing (ISP), processing using DRAM in the SSD (PuD-SSD), and in-flash processing (IFP). A large body of prior SSD-based NDP techniques operate in isolation, mapping computations to only one or two NDP paradigms (i.e., ISP, PuD-SSD, or IFP) within the SSD. These techniques (1) are tailored to specific workloads or kernels, (2) do not exploit the full computational potential of an SSD, and (3) lack programmer-transparency. While several prior works propose techniques to partition computation between the host and near-memory accelerators, adapting these techniques to SSDs has limited benefits because they (1) ignore the heterogeneity of the SSD resources, and (2) make offloading decisions based on limited factors such as bandwidth utilization, or data movement cost. We propose Conduit, a general-purpose, programmer-transparent NDP framework for SSDs that leverages multiple SSD computation resources. At compile time, Conduit executes a custom compiler (e.g., LLVM) pass that (i) vectorizes suitable application code segments into SIMD operations that align with the SSD's page layout, and (ii) embeds metadata (e.g., operation type, operand sizes) into the vectorized instructions to guide runtime offloading decisions. At runtime, within the SSD, Conduit performs instruction-granularity offloading by evaluating six key features, and uses a cost function to select the most suitable SSD resource. We evaluate Conduit and two prior NDP offloading techniques using an in-house event-driven SSD simulator on six data-intensive workloads. Conduit outperforms the best-performing prior offloading policy by 1.8x and reduces energy consumption by 46%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17633v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Laws for Moral Machine Judgment in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17637</link><description>arXiv:2601.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems increasingly require moral judgment capabilities, yet whether these capabilities scale predictably with model size remains unexplored. We systematically evaluate 75 large language model configurations (0.27B--1000B parameters) using the Moral Machine framework, measuring alignment with human preferences in life-death dilemmas. We observe a consistent power-law relationship with distance from human preferences ($D$) decreasing as $D \propto S^{-0.10\pm0.01}$ ($R^2=0.50$, $p&lt;0.001$) where $S$ is model size. Mixed-effects models confirm this relationship persists after controlling for model family and reasoning capabilities. Extended reasoning models show additional 16\% improvement beyond scale effects. The relationship holds across diverse architectures, while variance decreases at larger scales, indicating systematic emergence of more reliable moral judgment with computational scale. These findings extend scaling law research to value-based judgments and provide empirical foundations for artificial intelligence governance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17637v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FOCA: Multimodal Malware Classification via Hyperbolic Cross-Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17638</link><description>arXiv:2601.17638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce FOCA, a novel multimodal framework for malware classification that jointly leverages audio and visual modalities. Unlike conventional Euclidean-based fusion methods, FOCA is the first to exploit the intrinsic hierarchical relationships between audio and visual representations within hyperbolic space. To achieve this, raw binaries are transformed into both audio and visual representations, which are then processed through three key components: (i) a hyperbolic projection module that maps Euclidean embeddings into the Poincare ball, (ii) a hyperbolic cross-attention mechanism that aligns multimodal dependencies under curvature-aware constraints, and (iii) a Mobius addition-based fusion layer. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets-Mal-Net and CICMalDroid2020- show that FOCA consistently outperforms unimodal models, surpasses most Euclidean multimodal baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing works.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17638v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RPNT: Robust Pre-trained Neural Transformer -- A Pathway for Generalized Motor Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17641</link><description>arXiv:2601.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain decoding aims to interpret and translate neural activity into behaviors. As such, it is imperative that decoding models are able to generalize across variations, such as recordings from different brain sites, distinct sessions, different types of behavior, and a variety of subjects. Current models can only partially address these challenges and warrant the development of pretrained neural transformer models capable to adapt and generalize. In this work, we propose RPNT - Robust Pretrained Neural Transformer, designed to achieve robust generalization through pretraining, which in turn enables effective finetuning given a downstream task. In particular, RPNT unique components include 1) Multidimensional rotary positional embedding (MRoPE) to aggregate experimental metadata such as site coordinates, session name and behavior types; 2) Context-based attention mechanism via convolution kernels operating on global attention to learn local temporal structures for handling non-stationarity of neural population activity; 3) Robust self-supervised learning (SSL) objective with uniform causal masking strategies and contrastive representations. We pretrained two separate versions of RPNT on distinct datasets a) Multi-session, multi-task, and multi-subject microelectrode benchmark; b) Multi-site recordings using high-density Neuropixel 1.0 probes. The datasets include recordings from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and from the primary motor cortex (M1) regions of nonhuman primates (NHPs) as they performed reaching tasks. After pretraining, we evaluated the generalization of RPNT in cross-session, cross-type, cross-subject, and cross-site downstream behavior decoding tasks. Our results show that RPNT consistently achieves and surpasses the decoding performance of existing decoding models in all tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17641v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Health-ORSC-Bench: A Benchmark for Measuring Over-Refusal and Safety Completion in Health Context</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17642</link><description>arXiv:2601.17642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models is critical for healthcare; however, reliance on binary refusal boundaries often results in \emph{over-refusal} of benign queries or \emph{unsafe compliance} with harmful ones. While existing benchmarks measure these extremes, they fail to evaluate Safe Completion: the model's ability to maximise helpfulness on dual-use or borderline queries by providing safe, high-level guidance without crossing into actionable harm. We introduce \textbf{Health-ORSC-Bench}, the first large-scale benchmark designed to systematically measure \textbf{Over-Refusal} and \textbf{Safe Completion} quality in healthcare. Comprising 31,920 benign boundary prompts across seven health categories (e.g., self-harm, medical misinformation), our framework uses an automated pipeline with human validation to test models at varying levels of intent ambiguity. We evaluate 30 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5 and Claude-4, revealing a significant tension: safety-optimised models frequently refuse up to 80\% of "Hard" benign prompts, while domain-specific models often sacrifice safety for utility. Our findings demonstrate that model family and size significantly influence calibration: larger frontier models (e.g., GPT-5, Llama-4) exhibit "safety-pessimism" and higher over-refusal than smaller or MoE-based counterparts (e.g., Qwen-3-Next), highlighting that current LLMs struggle to balance refusal and compliance. Health-ORSC-Bench provides a rigorous standard for calibrating the next generation of medical AI assistants toward nuanced, safe, and helpful completions. The code and data will be released upon acceptance. \textcolor{red}{Warning: Some contents may include toxic or undesired contents.}</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17642v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Systemic Evaluation of Multimodal RAG Privacy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17644</link><description>arXiv:2601.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) pipelines for vision-centric tasks (e.g. visual QA) introduces important privacy challenges. In particular, while mRAG provides a practical capability to connect private datasets to improve model performance, it risks the leakage of private information from these datasets during inference. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to analyze the privacy risks inherent in the mRAG pipeline observed through standard model prompting. Specifically, we implement a case study that attempts to infer the inclusion of a visual asset, e.g. image, in the mRAG, and if present leak the metadata, e.g. caption, related to it. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms and motivate future research on mRAG privacy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17644v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AVMeme Exam: A Multimodal Multilingual Multicultural Benchmark for LLMs' Contextual and Cultural Knowledge and Thinking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17645</link><description>arXiv:2601.17645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet audio-visual clips convey meaning through time-varying sound and motion, which extend beyond what text alone can represent. To examine whether AI models can understand such signals in human cultural contexts, we introduce AVMeme Exam, a human-curated benchmark of over one thousand iconic Internet sounds and videos spanning speech, songs, music, and sound effects. Each meme is paired with a unique Q&amp;amp;A assessing levels of understanding from surface content to context and emotion to usage and world knowledge, along with metadata such as original year, transcript, summary, and sensitivity. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) alongside human participants using this benchmark. Our results reveal a consistent limitation: current models perform poorly on textless music and sound effects, and struggle to think in context and in culture compared to surface content. These findings highlight a key gap in human-aligned multimodal intelligence and call for models that can perceive contextually and culturally beyond the surface of what they hear and see.

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) stability is usually studied via single-valued outputs, while convex non-strict losses yield set-valued minimizers. We identify Painlev\'e-Kuratowski upper semicontinuity (PK-u.s.c.) as the intrinsic stability notion for the ERM solution correspondence (set-level Hadamard well-posedness) and a prerequisite to interpret stability of selections. We then characterize a minimal non-degenerate qualitative regime: Mosco-consistent perturbations and locally bounded minimizers imply PK-u.s.c., minimal-value continuity, and consistency of vanishing-gap near-minimizers.

Abstract: Quantifying the causal relationship between ice melt and freshwater distribution is critical, as these complex interactions manifest as regional fluctuations in sea surface height (SSH). Leveraging SSH as a proxy for sea ice dynamics enables improved understanding of the feedback mechanisms driving polar climate change and global sea-level rise. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle with reliable treatment effect estimation in spatiotemporal settings due to unobserved confounders and the absence of physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose the Knowledge-Guided Causal Model Variational Autoencoder (KGCM-VAE) to quantify causal mechanisms between sea ice thickness and SSH. The proposed framework integrates a velocity modulation scheme in which smoothed velocity signals are dynamically amplified via a sigmoid function governed by SSH transitions to generate physically grounded causal treatments. In addition, the model incorporates Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to balance treated and control covariate distributions in the latent space, along with a causal adjacency-constrained decoder to ensure alignment with established physical structures. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world Arctic datasets demonstrate that KGCM-VAE achieves superior PEHE compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the approach, showing that the joint application of MMD and causal adjacency constraints yields a 1.88\% reduction in estimation error.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17647v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Kareus: Joint Reduction of Dynamic and Static Energy in Large Model Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17654</link><description>arXiv:2601.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computing demand of AI is growing at an unprecedented rate, but energy supply is not keeping pace. As a result, energy has become an expensive, contended resource that requires explicit management and optimization. Although recent works have made significant progress in large model training optimization, they focus only on a single aspect of energy consumption: dynamic or static energy.
  We find that fine-grained kernel scheduling and frequency scaling jointly and interdependently impact both dynamic and static energy consumption. Based on this finding, we design Kareus, a training system that pushes the time--energy tradeoff frontier by optimizing both aspects. Kareus decomposes the intractable joint optimization problem into local, partition-based subproblems. It then uses a multi-pass multi-objective optimization algorithm to find execution schedules that push the time--energy tradeoff frontier. Compared to the state of the art, Kareus reduces training energy by up to 28.3% at the same training time, or reduces training time by up to 27.5% at the same energy consumption.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17654v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Battery-Free and Gateway-Free Cellular IoT Water Leak Detection System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17656</link><description>arXiv:2601.17656v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has accomplished extraordinary success for semantic understanding but inherently struggles to perceive geometric structure. Existing methods attempt to bridge this gap by querying CLIP with textual prompts, a process that is often indirect and inefficient. This paper introduces a fundamentally different approach using a dual-pathway decoder. We present SPACE-CLIP, an architecture that unlocks and interprets latent geometric knowledge directly from a frozen CLIP vision encoder, completely bypassing the text encoder and its associated textual prompts. A semantic pathway interprets high-level features, dynamically conditioned on global context using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). In addition, a structural pathway extracts fine-grained spatial details from early layers. These complementary streams are hierarchically fused, enabling a robust synthesis of semantic context and precise geometry. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that SPACE-CLIP dramatically outperforms previous CLIP-based methods. Our ablation studies validate that the synergistic fusion of our dual pathways is critical to this success. SPACE-CLIP offers a new, efficient, and architecturally elegant blueprint for repurposing large-scale vision models. The proposed method is not just a standalone depth estimator, but a readily integrable spatial perception module for the next generation of embodied AI systems, such as vision-language-action (VLA) models.

Abstract: The rise of conspiracy theories has created far-reaching societal harm in the public discourse by eroding trust and fueling polarization. Beyond this public impact lies a deeply personal toll on the friends and families of conspiracy believers, a dimension often overlooked in large-scale computational research. This study fills this gap by systematically mapping radicalization journeys and quantifying the associated emotional toll inflicted on loved ones. We use the prominent case of QAnon as a case study, analyzing 12747 narratives from the r/QAnonCasualties support community through a novel mixed-methods approach. First, we use topic modeling (BERTopic) to map the radicalization trajectories, identifying key pre-existing conditions, triggers, and post-radicalization characteristics. From this, we apply an LDA-based graphical model to uncover six recurring archetypes of QAnon adherents, which we term "radicalization personas." Finally, using LLM-assisted emotion detection and regression modeling, we link these personas to the specific emotional toll reported by narrators. Our findings reveal that these personas are not just descriptive; they are powerful predictors of the specific emotional harms experienced by narrators. Radicalization perceived as a deliberate ideological choice is associated with narrator anger and disgust, while those marked by personal and cognitive collapse are linked to fear and sadness. This work provides the first empirical framework for understanding radicalization as a relational phenomenon, offering a vital roadmap for researchers and practitioners to navigate its interpersonal fallout.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17658v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Battery-less Long-Range LTE-M Water Leak Detector</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17660</link><description>arXiv:2601.17660v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by 230 million people worldwide, lacks dedicated transformer-based language models and curated corpora. While multilingual models provide limited Urdu support, they suffer from poor performance, high computational costs, and cultural inaccuracies due to insufficient training data. To address these challenges, we present UrduLM, a pretrained Urdu monolingual language model trained in low-resource settings. We curate a 33GB Urdu corpus from diverse sources, develop a custom BPE tokenizer that reduces tokenization overhead by atleast 20-30% compared to multilingual alternatives, and pretrain a 100M-parameter decoder-only model. In few-shot evaluations, UrduLM achieves competitive performance with multilingual models up to 30x its size, reaching 66.6% accuracy on sentiment classification and BLEU scores exceeding 30 on grammar correction tasks.

Abstract: Real-world meal images often contain multiple food items, making reliable compositional food image generation important for applications such as image-based dietary assessment, where multi-food data augmentation is needed, and recipe visualization. However, modern text-to-image diffusion models struggle to generate accurate multi-food images due to object entanglement, where adjacent foods (e.g., rice and soup) fuse together because many foods do not have clear boundaries. To address this challenge, we introduce Prompt Grafting (PG), a training-free framework that combines explicit spatial cues in text with implicit layout guidance during sampling. PG runs a two-stage process where a layout prompt first establishes distinct regions and the target prompt is grafted once layout formation stabilizes. The framework enables food entanglement control: users can specify which food items should remain separated or be intentionally mixed by editing the arrangement of layouts. Across two food datasets, our method significantly improves the presence of target objects and provides qualitative evidence of controllable separation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17666v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast KVzip: Efficient and Accurate LLM Inference with Gated KV Eviction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17668</link><description>arXiv:2601.17668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient key-value (KV) cache management is crucial for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs), yet existing compression techniques often incur a trade-off between performance degradation and computational overhead. We propose a novel gating-based KV cache eviction method for frozen-weight LLMs that achieves high compression ratios with negligible computational cost. Our approach introduces lightweight sink-attention gating modules to identify and retain critical KV pairs, and integrates seamlessly into both the prefill and decoding stages. The proposed gate training algorithm relies on forward passes of an LLM, avoiding expensive backpropagation, while achieving strong task generalization through a task-agnostic reconstruction objective. Extensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-1M, Qwen3, and Gemma3 families show that our method maintains near-lossless performance while evicting up to 70% of the KV cache. The results are consistent across a wide range of tasks, including long-context understanding, code comprehension, and mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the generality of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17668v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Grammar-Aware Literate Generative Mathematical Programming with Compiler-in-the-Loop</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17670</link><description>arXiv:2601.17670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates generative mathematical programming through the lens of Algebraic Modelling Languages (AMLs) and compiler-guided model synthesis. By leveraging PyOPL, an OPL-like AML compiler that provides detailed syntax diagnostics, we introduce SyntAGM, an end-to-end system that translates natural language problem descriptions into PyOPL models via a generate--compile--assess--revise loop. SyntAGM is grammar-aware thanks to in-context exposure to the PyOPL BNF grammar, and benefits from few-shot retrieval of literate PyOPL model exemplars. To obtain a valid PyOPL model that matches the problem description, SyntAGM mobilises compiler feedback and an LLM-based alignment judge. In a comparative study against established prompting baselines SyntAGM achieves competitive accuracy with superior token, cost, and latency profiles.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17670v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Align to the Pivot: Dual Alignment with Self-Feedback for Multilingual Math Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17671</link><description>arXiv:2601.17671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive reasoning abilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), empirical evidence indicates that they are not language agnostic as expected, leading to performance declines in multilingual settings, especially for low-resource languages. We attribute the decline to the model's inconsistent multilingual understanding and reasoning alignment. To address this, we present Pivot-Aligned Self-Feedback Multilingual Reasoning (PASMR), aiming to improve the alignment of multilingual math reasoning abilities in LLMs. This approach designates the model's primary language as the pivot language. During training, the model first translates questions into the pivot language to facilitate better alignment of reasoning patterns. The reasoning process in the target language is then supervised by the pivot language's reasoning answers, thereby establishing a cross-lingual self-feedback mechanism without relying on external correct answers or reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances both the model's understanding of questions and its reasoning capabilities, leading to notable task improvements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17671v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uni-RS: A Spatially Faithful Unified Understanding and Generation Model for Remote Sensing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17673</link><description>arXiv:2601.17673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified remote sensing multimodal models exhibit a pronounced spatial reversal curse: Although they can accurately recognize and describe object locations in images, they often fail to faithfully execute the same spatial relations during text-to-image generation, where such relations constitute core semantic information in remote sensing. Motivated by this observation, we propose Uni-RS, the first unified multimodal model tailored for remote sensing, to explicitly address the spatial asymmetry between understanding and generation. Specifically, we first introduce explicit Spatial-Layout Planning to transform textual instructions into spatial layout plans, decoupling geometric planning from visual synthesis. We then impose Spatial-Aware Query Supervision to bias learnable queries toward spatial relations explicitly specified in the instruction. Finally, we develop Image-Caption Spatial Layout Variation to expose the model to systematic geometry-consistent spatial transformations. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our approach substantially improves spatial faithfulness in text-to-image generation, while maintaining strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks like image captioning, visual grounding, and VQA tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17673v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GazeSummary: Exploring Gaze as an Implicit Prompt for Personalization in Text-based LLM Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17676</link><description>arXiv:2601.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart glasses are accelerating progress toward more seamless and personalized LLM-based assistance by integrating multimodal inputs. Yet, these inputs rely on obtrusive explicit prompts.

This paper investigates whether LLMs can interpret user gaze for text-based tasks. We evaluate different gaze representations for personalization and validate their effectiveness in realistic reading tasks. Results show that LLMs can leverage gaze to generate high-quality personalized summaries and support users in downstream tasks, highlighting the feasibility and value of gaze-driven personalization for future mobile and wearable LLM applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17676v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DIML: Differentiable Inverse Mechanism Learning from Behaviors of Multi-Agent Learning Trajectories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17678</link><description>arXiv:2601.17678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inverse mechanism learning: recovering an unknown incentive-generating mechanism from observed strategic interaction traces of self-interested learning agents. Unlike inverse game theory and multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning, which typically infer utility/reward parameters inside a structured mechanism, our target includes unstructured mechanism -- a (possibly neural) mapping from joint actions to per-agent payoffs. Unlike differentiable mechanism design, which optimizes mechanisms forward, we infer mechanisms from behavior in an observational setting. We propose DIML, a likelihood-based framework that differentiates through a model of multi-agent learning dynamics and uses the candidate mechanism to generate counterfactual payoffs needed to predict observed actions. We establish identifiability of payoff differences under a conditional logit response model and prove statistical consistency of maximum likelihood estimation under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate DIML with simulated interactions of learning agents across unstructured neural mechanisms, congestion tolling, public goods subsidies, and large-scale anonymous games. DIML reliably recovers identifiable incentive differences and supports counterfactual prediction, where its performance rivals tabular enumeration oracle in small environments and its convergence scales to large, hundred-participant environments. Code to reproduce our experiments is open-sourced.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17678v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BanglaRobustNet: A Hybrid Denoising-Attention Architecture for Robust Bangla Speech Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17679</link><description>arXiv:2601.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bangla, one of the most widely spoken languages, remains underrepresented in state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) research, particularly under noisy and speaker-diverse conditions. This paper presents BanglaRobustNet, a hybrid denoising-attention framework built on Wav2Vec-BERT, designed to address these challenges. The architecture integrates a diffusion-based denoising module to suppress environmental noise while preserving Bangla-specific phonetic cues, and a contextual cross-attention module that conditions recognition on speaker embeddings for robustness across gender, age, and dialects. Trained end-to-end with a composite objective combining CTC loss, phonetic consistency, and speaker alignment, BanglaRobustNet achieves substantial reductions in word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) compared to Wav2Vec-BERT and Whisper baselines. Evaluations on Mozilla Common Voice Bangla and augmented noisy speech confirm the effectiveness of our approach, establishing BanglaRobustNet as a robust ASR system tailored to low-resource, noise-prone linguistic settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17679v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] $\infty$-MoE: Generalizing Mixture of Experts to Infinite Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17680</link><description>arXiv:2601.17680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) selects a few feed-forward networks (FFNs) per token, achieving an effective trade-off between computational cost and performance. In conventional MoE, each expert is treated as entirely independent, and experts are combined in a discrete space. As a result, when the number of experts increases, it becomes difficult to train each expert effectively. To stabilize training while increasing the number of experts, we propose $\infty$-MoE that selects a portion of the parameters of large FFNs based on continuous values sampled for each token. By considering experts in a continuous space, this approach allows for an infinite number of experts while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that a GPT-2 Small-based $\infty$-MoE model, with 129M active and 186M total parameters, achieves comparable performance to a dense GPT-2 Medium with 350M parameters. Adjusting the number of sampled experts at inference time allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and speed, with an improvement of up to 2.5\% in accuracy over conventional MoE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Composite Adaptive Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Systems with Parametric Uncertainty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17683</link><description>arXiv:2601.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions guarantee safety but typically require accurate system models. Parametric uncertainty invalidates these guarantees. Existing robust methods maintain safety via worst-case bounds, limiting performance, while modular learning schemes decouple estimation from safety, permitting state violations during training. This paper presents the composite adaptive control barrier function (CaCBF) algorithm for nonlinear control-affine systems subject to linear parametric uncertainty. We derive adaptation laws from a composite energy function comprising a logarithmic safety barrier, a control Lyapunov function, and a parameter error term. We prove that CaCBF guarantees the forward invariance of the safe set and the uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system. This safety guarantee holds without requiring parameter convergence. Simulations of adaptive cruise control, an omnidirectional robot, and a planar drone demonstrate the efficacy of the CaCBF algorithm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17683v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Model-Driven Lossless Compression Algorithm Resistant to Mismatch</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17684</link><description>arXiv:2601.17684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the fundamental connection between next-symbol prediction and compression, modern predictive models, such as large language models (LLMs), can be combined with entropy coding to achieve compression rates that surpass those of standard compression algorithms. However, this approach relies on the assumption that the predictive model produces identical output distributions at both the encoder and decoder, since even small mismatches can cause the decoding to fail. This assumption often fails with complex predictive models, particularly those based on neural networks, a phenomenon referred to as non-determinism.
  In this work, we propose a new compression algorithm based on next-token prediction that is robust to arbitrarily large, but structured, prediction mismatches. We prove the correctness of the proposed scheme under a formal mismatch certification, characterize its theoretical performance, and validate it experimentally on real datasets. Our results demonstrate reliable operation within the certified mismatch regime while achieving compression ratios that exceed those of commonly used compression methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17684v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sinh regularized Lagrangian nonuniform sampling series</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17685</link><description>arXiv:2601.17685v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Language models are revolutionizing the biochemistry domain, assisting scientists in drug design and chemical synthesis with high efficiency. Yet current approaches struggle between small language models prone to hallucination and limited knowledge retention, and large cloud-based language models plagued by privacy risks and high inference costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChemCRAFT, a novel framework leveraging agentic reinforcement learning to decouple chemical reasoning from knowledge storage. Instead of forcing the model to memorize vast chemical data, our approach empowers the language model to interact with a sandbox for precise information retrieval. This externalization of knowledge allows a locally deployable small model to achieve superior performance with minimal inference costs. To enable small language models for agent-calling ability, we build an agentic trajectory construction pipeline and a comprehensive chemical-agent sandbox. Based on sandbox interactions, we constructed ChemToolDataset, the first large-scale chemical tool trajectory dataset. Simultaneously, we propose SMILES-GRPO to build a dense chemical reward function, promoting the model's ability to call chemical agents. Evaluations across diverse aspects of drug design show that ChemCRAFT outperforms current cloud-based LLMs in molecular structure analysis, molecular optimization, and synthesis pathway prediction, demonstrating that scientific reasoning is not solely an emergent ability of model scale, but a learnable policy of tool orchestration. This work establishes a cost-effective and privacy-preserving paradigm for AI-aided chemistry, opening new avenues for accelerating molecular discovery with locally deployable agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17687v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] REV-INR: Regularized Evidential Implicit Neural Representation for Uncertainty-Aware Volume Visualization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17689</link><description>arXiv:2601.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising deep learning approach for compactly representing large volumetric datasets. These models can act as surrogates for volume data, enabling efficient storage and on-demand reconstruction via model predictions. However, conventional deterministic INRs only provide value predictions without insights into the model's prediction uncertainty or the impact of inherent noisiness in the data. This limitation can lead to unreliable data interpretation and visualization due to prediction inaccuracies in the reconstructed volume. Identifying erroneous results extracted from model-predicted data may be infeasible, as raw data may be unavailable due to its large size. To address this challenge, we introduce REV-INR, Regularized Evidential Implicit Neural Representation, which learns to predict data values accurately along with the associated coordinate-level data uncertainty and model uncertainty using only a single forward pass of the trained REV-INR during inference. By comprehensively comparing and contrasting REV-INR with existing well-established deep uncertainty estimation methods, we show that REV-INR achieves the best volume reconstruction quality with robust data (aleatoric) and model (epistemic) uncertainty estimates using the fastest inference time. Consequently, we demonstrate that REV-INR facilitates assessment of the reliability and trustworthiness of the extracted isosurfaces and volume visualization results, enabling analyses to be solely driven by model-predicted data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17689v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Segment Length Matters: A Study of Segment Lengths on Audio Fingerprinting Performance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17690</link><description>arXiv:2601.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio fingerprinting provides an identifiable representation of acoustic signals, which can be later used for identification and retrieval systems. To obtain a discriminative representation, the input audio is usually segmented into shorter time intervals, allowing local acoustic features to be extracted and analyzed. Modern neural approaches typically operate on short, fixed-duration audio segments, yet the choice of segment duration is often made heuristically and rarely examined in depth. In this paper, we study how segment length affects audio fingerprinting performance. We extend an existing neural fingerprinting architecture to adopt various segment lengths and evaluate retrieval accuracy across different segment lengths and query durations. Our results show that short segment lengths (0.5-second) generally achieve better performance. Moreover, we evaluate LLM capacity in recommending the best segment length, which shows that GPT-5-mini consistently gives the best suggestions across five considerations among three studied LLMs. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting segment duration in large-scale neural audio retrieval systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17690v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LegalMALR:Multi-Agent Query Understanding and LLM-Based Reranking for Chinese Statute Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17692</link><description>arXiv:2601.17692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statute retrieval is essential for legal assistance and judicial decision support, yet real-world legal queries are often implicit, multi-issue, and expressed in colloquial or underspecified forms. These characteristics make it difficult for conventional retrieval-augmented generation pipelines to recover the statutory elements required for accurate retrieval. Dense retrievers focus primarily on the literal surface form of the query, whereas lightweight rerankers lack the legal-reasoning capacity needed to assess statutory applicability. We present LegalMALR, a retrieval framework that integrates a Multi-Agent Query Understanding System (MAS) with a zero-shot large-language-model-based reranking module (LLM Reranker). MAS generates diverse, legally grounded reformulations and conducts iterative dense retrieval to broaden candidate coverage. To stabilise the stochastic behaviour of LLM-generated rewrites, we optimise a unified MAS policy using Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization(GRPO). The accumulated candidate set is subsequently evaluated by the LLM Reranker, which performs natural-language legal reasoning to produce the final ranking. We further construct CSAID, a dataset of 118 difficult Chinese legal queries annotated with multiple statutory labels, and evaluate LegalMALR on both CSAID and the public STARD benchmark. Experiments show that LegalMALR substantially outperforms strong Retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multi-perspective query interpretation, reinforcement-based policy optimisation, and large-model reranking for statute retrieval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17692v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StyleDecoupler: Generalizable Artistic Style Disentanglement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17697</link><description>arXiv:2601.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing artistic style is challenging due to its deep entanglement with semantic content.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved Text-to-SQL generation, a pronounced gap remains between AI systems and human experts on challenging benchmarks such as BIRD-SQL. We argue this gap stems largely from the prevailing single-pass paradigm, which lacks the iterative reasoning, schema exploration, and error-correction behaviors that humans naturally employ. To address this limitation, we introduce SQL-Trail, a multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) agentic framework for Text-to-SQL. Rather than producing a query in one shot, SQL-Trail interacts with the database environment and uses execution feedback to iteratively refine its predictions. Our approach centers on two key ideas: (i) an adaptive turn-budget allocation mechanism that scales the agent's interaction depth to match question difficulty, and (ii) a composite reward panel that jointly incentivizes SQL correctness and efficient exploration. Across benchmarks, SQL-Trail sets a new state of the art and delivers strong data efficiency--up to 18x higher than prior single-pass RL state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our 7B and 14B models outperform substantially larger proprietary systems by 5% on average, underscoring the effectiveness of interactive, agentic workflows for robust Text-to-SQL generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17699v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] S$^3$-Attention:Attention-Aligned Endogenous Retrieval for Memory-Bounded Long-Context Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17702</link><description>arXiv:2601.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to multi-document and long-form inputs, yet long-context inference remains memory- and noise-inefficient. Key-value (KV) caching scales linearly with context length, while external retrieval methods often return lexically similar but causally irrelevant passages.
  We present S3-Attention, a memory-first inference-time framework that treats long-context processing as attention-aligned endogenous retrieval. S3-Attention decodes transient key and query projections into top-k sparse feature identifiers using lightweight sparse autoencoders, and constructs a CPU-based inverted index mapping features to token positions or spans during a single streaming scan. This design allows the KV cache to be discarded entirely and bounds GPU memory usage by the scan chunk size.
  At generation time, feature co-activation is used to retrieve compact evidence spans, optionally fused with BM25 for exact lexical matching. Under a unified LongBench evaluation protocol with fixed prompting, decoding, and matched token budgets, S3-Hybrid closely matches full-context inference across multiple model families and improves robustness in several information-dense settings. We also report an engineering limitation of the current prototype, which incurs higher wall-clock latency than optimized full-KV baselines, motivating future kernel-level optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17702v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An AI-enabled tool for quantifying overlapping red blood cell sickling dynamics in microfluidic assays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17703</link><description>arXiv:2601.17703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding sickle cell dynamics requires accurate identification of morphological transitions under diverse biophysical conditions, particularly in densely packed and overlapping cell populations. Here, we present an automated deep learning framework that integrates AI-assisted annotation, segmentation, classification, and instance counting to quantify red blood cell (RBC) populations across varying density regimes in time-lapse microscopy data. Experimental images were annotated using the Roboflow platform to generate labeled dataset for training an nnU-Net segmentation model. The trained network enables prediction of the temporal evolution of the sickle cell fraction, while a watershed algorithm resolves overlapping cells to enhance quantification accuracy. Despite requiring only a limited amount of labeled data for training, the framework achieves high segmentation performance, effectively addressing challenges associated with scarce manual annotations and cell overlap. By quantitatively tracking dynamic changes in RBC morphology, this approach can more than double the experimental throughput via densely packed cell suspensions, capture drug-dependent sickling behavior, and reveal distinct mechanobiological signatures of cellular morphological evolution. Overall, this AI-driven framework establishes a scalable and reproducible computational platform for investigating cellular biomechanics and assessing therapeutic efficacy in microphysiological systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17703v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distance-to-Distance Ratio: A Similarity Measure for Sentences Based on Rate of Change in LLM Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17705</link><description>arXiv:2601.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A measure of similarity between text embeddings can be considered adequate only if it adheres to the human perception of similarity between texts. In this paper, we introduce the distance-to-distance ratio (DDR), a novel measure of similarity between LLM sentence embeddings. Inspired by Lipschitz continuity, DDR measures the rate of change in similarity between the pre-context word embeddings and the similarity between post-context LLM embeddings, thus measuring the semantic influence of context. We evaluate the performance of DDR in experiments designed as a series of perturbations applied to sentences drawn from a sentence dataset. For each sentence, we generate variants by replacing one, two, or three words with either synonyms, which constitute semantically similar text, or randomly chosen words, which constitute semantically dissimilar text. We compare the performance of DDR with other prevailing similarity metrics and demonstrate that DDR consistently provides finer discrimination between semantically similar and dissimilar texts, even under minimal, controlled edits.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17705v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Computational Approach to Visual Metonymy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17706</link><description>arXiv:2601.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images often communicate more than they literally depict: a set of tools can suggest an occupation and a cultural artifact can suggest a tradition. This kind of indirect visual reference, known as visual metonymy, invites viewers to recover a target concept via associated cues rather than explicit depiction. In this work, we present the first computational investigation of visual metonymy. We introduce a novel pipeline grounded in semiotic theory that leverages large language models and text-to-image models to generate metonymic visual representations. Using this framework, we construct ViMET, the first visual metonymy dataset comprising 2,000 multiple-choice questions to evaluate the cognitive reasoning abilities in multimodal language models. Experimental results on our dataset reveal a significant gap between human performance (86.9%) and state-of-the-art vision-language models (65.9%), highlighting limitations in machines' ability to interpret indirect visual references. Our dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/cincynlp/ViMET.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17706v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-core &amp; GPU-based Balanced Butterfly Counting in Signed Bipartite Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17707</link><description>arXiv:2601.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balanced butterfly counting, corresponding to counting balanced (2, 2)-bicliques, is a fundamental primitive in the analysis of signed bipartite graphs and provides a basis for studying higher-order structural properties such as clustering coefficients and community structure. Although prior work has proposed an efficient CPU-based serial method for counting balanced (2, k)-bicliques. The computational cost of balanced butterfly counting remains a major bottleneck on large-scale graphs. In this work, we present the highly parallel implementations for balanced butterfly counting for both multicore CPUs and GPUs. The proposed multi-core algorithm (M-BBC) employs fine-grained vertex-level parallelism to accelerate wedge-based counting while eliminating the generation of unbalanced substructures. To improve scalability, we develop a GPU-based method (G-BBC) that uses a tile-based parallel approach to effectively leverage shared memory while handling large vertex sets. We then present an improved variation, G-BBC++, which integrates dynamic scheduling to mitigate workload imbalance and maximize throughput. We conduct an experimental assessment of the proposed methods across 15 real-world datasets. Experimental results exhibit that M-BBC achieves speedups of up to 71.13x (average 38.13x) over the sequential baseline BB2K. The GPU-based algorithms deliver even greater improvements, achieving up to 13,320x speedup (average 2,600x) over BB2K and outperforming M-BBC by up to 186x (average 50x). These results indicate the substantial scalability and efficiency of our parallel algorithms and establish a robust foundation for high-performance signed motif analysis on massive bipartite graphs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17707v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-Order Mesh r-Adaptivity with Tangential Relaxation and Guaranteed Mesh Validity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17708</link><description>arXiv:2601.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order meshes are crucial for achieving optimal convergence rates in curvilinear domains, preserving symmetry, and aligning with key flow features in moving mesh simulations, but their quality is challenging to control. In prior work, we have developed techniques based on Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm (TMOP) to adapt a given high-order mesh to the geometry and solution of the partial differential equation (PDE). Here, we extend this framework to address two key gaps in the literature for high-order mesh r-adaptivity. First, we introduce tangential relaxation on curved surfaces using solely the discrete mesh representation, eliminating the need for access to underlying geometry (e.g., CAD model). Second, we ensure a continuously positive Jacobian determinant throughout the domain. This determinant positivity is essential for using the high-order mesh resulting from r-adaptivity with arbitrary quadrature schemes in simulations. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be robust using a variety of numerical experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17708v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CaSNet: Compress-and-Send Network Based Multi-Device Speech Enhancement Model for Distributed Microphone Arrays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17711</link><description>arXiv:2601.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed microphone array (DMA) is a promising next-generation platform for speech interaction, where speech enhancement (SE) is still required to improve the speech quality in noisy cases. Existing SE methods usually first gather raw waveforms at a fusion center (FC) from all devices and then design a multi-microphone model, causing high bandwidth and energy costs. In this work, we propose a \emph{Compress-and-Send Network (CaSNet)} for resource-constrained DMAs, where one microphone serves as the FC and reference. Each of other devices encodes the measured raw data into a feature matrix, which is then compressed by singular value decomposition (SVD) to produce a more compact representation. The received features at the FC are aligned via cross window query with respect to the reference, followed by neural decoding to yield spatially coherent enhanced speech. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed CaSNet can save the data amount with a negligible impact on the performance compared to the uncompressed case. The reproducible code is available at https://github.com/Jokejiangv/CaSNet.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17711v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Reasoning Models Ask Better Questions? A Formal Information-Theoretic Analysis on Multi-Turn LLM Games</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17716</link><description>arXiv:2601.17716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but still struggle with a critical ability for LLM-based agents: asking good questions for resolving ambiguity in user requests. While prior work has explored information-seeking behavior through word games, existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that provide both final and intermediate signals based on Information Gain (IG). Moreover, they rarely provide systematic comparisons between models that use chain-of-thought reasoning and those that do not. We propose a multi-turn dialogue framework that quantitatively measures how effectively LLMs gather information through yes/no questions in a hierarchical knowledge graph environment. Our framework employs a triad of interacting LLM agents that ask questions, answer them, and update the hypothesis space. We adopt IG as the main metric, grounded in Shannon entropy, to assess query effectiveness at each turn and cumulatively. We instantiate our framework in a geographical Guess My City game setting organized in a five-level taxonomy and evaluate multiple LLM variants under fully and partially observable conditions, with and without Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that, among the evaluated models, the ones with explicit reasoning capabilities achieve higher IG per turn and reach solutions in fewer steps, particularly in partially observable settings. Analysis of reasoning traces reveals that smaller models compensate for limited capacity through more aggressive exploration of candidate questions, while larger models exhibit higher assertiveness in selecting optimal queries, generating candidates with greater potential IG.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17716v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The LLM Data Auditor: A Metric-oriented Survey on Quality and Trustworthiness in Evaluating Synthetic Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17717</link><description>arXiv:2601.17717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating data across various modalities. By transforming data from a scarce resource into a controllable asset, LLMs mitigate the bottlenecks imposed by the acquisition costs of real-world data for model training, evaluation, and system iteration. However, ensuring the high quality of LLM-generated synthetic data remains a critical challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on generation methodologies, with limited direct attention to the quality of the resulting data. Furthermore, most studies are restricted to single modalities, lacking a unified perspective across different data types. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{LLM Data Auditor framework}. In this framework, we first describe how LLMs are utilized to generate data across six distinct modalities. More importantly, we systematically categorize intrinsic metrics for evaluating synthetic data from two dimensions: quality and trustworthiness. This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations for the community to improve the evaluation of data generation. Finally, the framework outlines methodologies for the practical application of synthetic data across different modalities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17717v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EntWorld: A Holistic Environment and Benchmark for Verifiable Enterprise GUI Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17722</link><description>arXiv:2601.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled agents to operate in open-ended web and operating system environments. However, existing benchmarks predominantly target consumer-oriented scenarios (e.g., e-commerce and travel booking), failing to capture the complexity and rigor of professional enterprise workflows. Enterprise systems pose distinct challenges, including high-density user interfaces, strict business logic constraints, and a strong reliance on precise, state-consistent information retrieval-settings in which current generalist agents often struggle. To address this gap, we introduce EntWorld, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 1,756 tasks across six representative enterprise domains, including customer relationship management (CRM), information technology infrastructure library (ITIL), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Unlike previous datasets that depend on fragile execution traces or extensive manual annotation, EntWorld adopts a schema-grounded task generation framework that directly reverse-engineers business logic from underlying database schemas, enabling the synthesis of realistic, long-horizon workflows. Moreover, we propose a SQL-based deterministic verification mechanism in building datasets that replaces ambiguous visual matching with rigorous state-transition validation. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4.1) achieve 47.61% success rate on EntWorld, substantially lower than the human performance, highlighting a pronounced enterprise gap in current agentic capabilities and the necessity of developing domain-specific agents. We release EntWorld as a rigorous testbed to facilitate the development and evaluation of the next generation of enterprise-ready digital agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17722v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Implicit Neural Representation-Based Continuous Single Image Super Resolution: An Empirical Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17723</link><description>arXiv:2601.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) has become the standard approach for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASSR). To date, no empirical study has systematically examined the effectiveness of existing methods, nor investigated the effects of different training recipes, such as scaling laws, objective design, and optimization strategies. A rigorous empirical analysis is essential not only for benchmarking performance and revealing true gains but also for establishing the current state of ASSR, identifying saturation limits, and highlighting promising directions. We fill this gap by comparing existing techniques across diverse settings and presenting aggregated performance results on multiple image quality metrics. We contribute a unified framework and code repository to facilitate reproducible comparisons. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of carefully controlled training configurations on perceptual image quality and examine a new loss function that penalizes intensity variations while preserving edges, textures, and finer details during training. We conclude the following key insights that have been previously overlooked: (1) Recent, more complex INR methods provide only marginal improvements over earlier methods. (2) Model performance is strongly correlated to training configurations, a factor overlooked in prior works. (3) The proposed loss enhances texture fidelity across architectures, emphasizing the role of objective design for targeted perceptual gains. (4) Scaling laws apply to INR-based ASSR, confirming predictable gains with increased model complexity and data diversity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17723v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised Elicitation of Moral Values from Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17728</link><description>arXiv:2601.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems become pervasive, grounding their behavior in human values is critical. Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) exhibit limited inherent moral reasoning, leading to calls for explicit moral teaching. However, constructing ground truth data for moral evaluation is difficult given plural frameworks and pervasive biases. We investigate unsupervised elicitation as an alternative, asking whether pretrained (base) LMs possess intrinsic moral reasoning capability that can be surfaced without human supervision. Using the Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) algorithm across three benchmark datasets and four LMs, we test whether ICM can reliably label moral judgments, generalize across moral frameworks, and mitigate social bias. Results show that ICM outperforms all pre-trained and chatbot baselines on the Norm Bank and ETHICS benchmarks, while fine-tuning on ICM labels performs on par with or surpasses those of human labels. Across theoretically motivated moral frameworks, ICM yields its largest relative gains on Justice and Commonsense morality. Furthermore, although chatbot LMs exhibit social bias failure rates comparable to their pretrained ones, ICM reduces such errors by more than half, with the largest improvements in race, socioeconomic status, and politics. These findings suggest that pretrained LMs possess latent moral reasoning capacities that can be elicited through unsupervised methods like ICM, providing a scalable path for AI alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17728v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Flatten The Complex: Joint B-Rep Generation via Compositional $k$-Cell Particles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17733</link><description>arXiv:2601.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary Representation (B-Rep) is the widely adopted standard
  in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and manufacturing. However, generative modeling of B-Reps remains a formidable challenge due to their inherent heterogeneity as geometric cell complexes, which entangles topology with geometry across cells of varying orders (i.e., $k$-cells such as vertices, edges, faces). Previous methods typically rely on cascaded sequences to handle this hierarchy, which fails to fully exploit the geometric relationships between cells, such as adjacency and sharing, limiting context awareness and error recovery. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm that reformulates B-Reps into sets of compositional $k$-cell particles. Our approach encodes each topological entity as a composition of particles, where adjacent cells share identical latents at their interfaces, thereby promoting geometric coupling along shared boundaries. By decoupling the rigid hierarchy, our representation unifies vertices, edges, and faces, enabling the joint generation of topology and geometry with global context awareness.
  We synthesize these particle sets using a multi-modal flow matching framework to handle unconditional generation as well as precise conditional tasks, such as 3D reconstruction from single-view or point cloud. Furthermore, the explicit and localized nature of our representation naturally extends to downstream tasks like local in-painting and enables the direct synthesis of non-manifold structures (e.g., wireframes). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-fidelity CAD models with superior validity and editability compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17733v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReFuGe: Feature Generation for Prediction Tasks on Relational Databases with LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17735</link><description>arXiv:2601.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) play a crucial role in many real-world web applications, supporting data management across multiple interconnected tables. Beyond typical retrieval-oriented tasks, prediction tasks on RDBs have recently gained attention. In this work, we address this problem by generating informative relational features that enhance predictive performance. However, generating such features is challenging: it requires reasoning over complex schemas and exploring a combinatorially large feature space, all without explicit supervision. To address these challenges, we propose ReFuGe, an agentic framework that leverages specialized large language model agents: (1) a schema selection agent identifies the tables and columns relevant to the task, (2) a feature generation agent produces diverse candidate features from the selected schema, and (3) a feature filtering agent evaluates and retains promising features through reasoning-based and validation-based filtering. It operates within an iterative feedback loop until performance converges. Experiments on RDB benchmarks demonstrate that ReFuGe substantially improves performance on various RDB prediction tasks.

Abstract: Interactivity is crucial for effective data visualizations. However, it is often challenging to implement interactions for existing static visualizations, since the underlying code and data for existing static visualizations are often not available, and it also takes significant time and effort to enable interactions for them even if the original code and data are available. To fill this gap, we propose Athanor, a novel approach to transform existing static visualizations into interactive ones using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and natural language instructions. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) an action-modification interaction design space that maps visualization interactions into user actions and corresponding adjustments, (2) a multi-agent requirement analyzer that translates natural language instructions into an actionable operational space, and (3) a visualization abstraction transformer that converts static visualizations into flexible and interactive representations regardless of their underlying implementation. Athanor allows users to effortlessly author interactions through natural language instructions, eliminating the need for programming. We conducted two case studies and in-depth interviews with target users to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach in allowing users to conveniently enable flexible interactions for static visualizations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17736v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Script is All You Need: An Agentic Framework for Long-Horizon Dialogue-to-Cinematic Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17737</link><description>arXiv:2601.17737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have produced models capable of synthesizing stunning visual content from simple text prompts. However, these models struggle to generate long-form, coherent narratives from high-level concepts like dialogue, revealing a ``semantic gap'' between a creative idea and its cinematic execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel, end-to-end agentic framework for dialogue-to-cinematic-video generation. Central to our framework is ScripterAgent, a model trained to translate coarse dialogue into a fine-grained, executable cinematic script. To enable this, we construct ScriptBench, a new large-scale benchmark with rich multimodal context, annotated via an expert-guided pipeline. The generated script then guides DirectorAgent, which orchestrates state-of-the-art video models using a cross-scene continuous generation strategy to ensure long-horizon coherence. Our comprehensive evaluation, featuring an AI-powered CriticAgent and a new Visual-Script Alignment (VSA) metric, shows our framework significantly improves script faithfulness and temporal fidelity across all tested video models. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a crucial trade-off in current SOTA models between visual spectacle and strict script adherence, providing valuable insights for the future of automated filmmaking.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17737v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Sewing Patterns via Latent Flow Matching of Implicit Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17740</link><description>arXiv:2601.17740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sewing patterns define the structural foundation of garments and are essential for applications such as fashion design, fabrication, and physical simulation. Despite progress in automated pattern generation, accurately modeling sewing patterns remains difficult due to the broad variability in panel geometry and seam arrangements. In this work, we introduce a sewing pattern modeling method based on an implicit representation. We represent each panel using a signed distance field that defines its boundary and an unsigned distance field that identifies seam endpoints, and encode these fields into a continuous latent space that enables differentiable meshing. A latent flow matching model learns distributions over panel combinations in this representation, and a stitching prediction module recovers seam relations from extracted edge segments. This formulation allows accurate modeling and generation of sewing patterns with complex structures. We further show that it can be used to estimate sewing patterns from images with improved accuracy relative to existing approaches, and supports applications such as pattern completion and refitting, providing a practical tool for digital fashion design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17740v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Frequency-aware Neural Representation for Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17741</link><description>arXiv:2601.17741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for video compression. However, existing INR-based frameworks typically suffer from inherent spectral bias, which favors low-frequency components and leads to over-smoothed reconstructions and suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In this paper, we propose FaNeRV, a Frequency-aware Neural Representation for videos, which explicitly decouples low- and high-frequency components to enable efficient and faithful video reconstruction. FaNeRV introduces a multi-resolution supervision strategy that guides the network to progressively capture global structures and fine-grained textures through staged supervision . To further enhance high-frequency reconstruction, we propose a dynamic high-frequency injection mechanism that adaptively emphasizes challenging regions. In addition, we design a frequency-decomposed network module to improve feature modeling across different spectral bands. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that FaNeRV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art INR methods and achieves competitive rate-distortion performance against traditional codecs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17741v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Video Compression with Hierarchical Temporal Neural Representation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17743</link><description>arXiv:2601.17743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video compression has recently benefited from implicit neural representations (INRs), which model videos as continuous functions. INRs offer compact storage and flexible reconstruction, providing a promising alternative to traditional codecs. However, most existing INR-based methods treat the temporal dimension as an independent input, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Temporal Neural Representation for Videos, TeNeRV. TeNeRV integrates short- and long-term dependencies through two key components. First, an Inter-Frame Feature Fusion (IFF) module aggregates features from adjacent frames, enforcing local temporal coherence and capturing fine-grained motion. Second, a GoP-Adaptive Modulation (GAM) mechanism partitions videos into Groups-of-Pictures and learns group-specific priors. The mechanism modulates network parameters, enabling adaptive representations across different GoPs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeNeRV consistently outperforms existing INR-based methods in rate-distortion performance, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17743v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Faramesh: A Protocol-Agnostic Execution Control Plane for Autonomous Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17744</link><description>arXiv:2601.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agent systems increasingly trigger real-world side effects: deploying infrastructure, modifying databases, moving money, and executing workflows. Yet most agent stacks provide no mandatory execution checkpoint where organizations can deterministically permit, deny, or defer an action before it changes reality. This paper introduces Faramesh, a protocol-agnostic execution control plane that enforces execution-time authorization for agent-driven actions via a non-bypassable Action Authorization Boundary (AAB). Faramesh canonicalizes agent intent into a Canonical Action Representation (CAR), evaluates actions deterministically against policy and state, and issues a decision artifact (PERMIT/DEFER/DENY) that executors must validate prior to execution. The system is designed to be framework- and model-agnostic, supports multi-agent and multi-tenant deployments, and remains independent of transport protocols (e.g., MCP). Faramesh further provides decision-centric, append-only provenance logging keyed by canonical action hashes, enabling auditability, verification, and deterministic replay without re-running agent reasoning. We show how these primitives yield enforceable, predictable governance for autonomous execution while avoiding hidden coupling to orchestration layers or observability-only approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17744v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Juror Predisposition Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Study of Human and Algorithmic Jury Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17745</link><description>arXiv:2601.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior studies on the effectiveness of professional jury consultants in predicting juror proclivities have yielded mixed results, and few have rigorously evaluated consultant performance against chance under controlled conditions. This study addresses that gap by empirically assessing whether jury consultants can reliably predict juror predispositions beyond chance levels and whether supervised machine-learning (ML) models can outperform consultant predictions. Using data from N mock jurors who completed pre-trial attitudinal questionnaires and rendered verdicts in a standardized wrongful-termination case, we compared predictions made by professional jury consultants with those generated by Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers. Model and consultant predictions were evaluated on a held-out test set using paired statistical tests and nonparametric bootstrap procedures. We find that supervised ML models significantly outperform professional jury consultants under identical informational constraints, while offering greater transparency, replicability, and auditability. These results provide an empirical benchmark for evaluating human judgment in jury selection and inform ongoing debates about the role of data-driven decision support in legal contexts. To support reproducibility and auditability, all code and data will be made publicly available upon publication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17745v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Supervision Gaps: A Unified Framework for Remote Sensing Change Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17747</link><description>arXiv:2601.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change detection (CD) aims to identify surface changes from multi-temporal remote sensing imagery. In real-world scenarios, Pixel-level change labels are expensive to acquire, and existing models struggle to adapt to scenarios with diverse annotation availability. To tackle this challenge, we propose a unified change detection framework (UniCD), which collaboratively handles supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised tasks through a coupled architecture. UniCD eliminates architectural barriers through a shared encoder and multi-branch collaborative learning mechanism, achieving deep coupling of heterogeneous supervision signals. Specifically, UniCD consists of three supervision-specific branches. In the supervision branch, UniCD introduces the spatial-temporal awareness module (STAM), achieving efficient synergistic fusion of bi-temporal features. In the weakly-supervised branch, we construct change representation regularization (CRR), which steers model convergence from coarse-grained activations toward coherent and separable change modeling. In the unsupervised branch, we propose semantic prior-driven change inference (SPCI), which transforms unsupervised tasks into controlled weakly-supervised path optimization. Experiments on mainstream datasets demonstrate that UniCD achieves optimal performance across three tasks. It exhibits significant accuracy improvements in weakly and unsupervised scenarios, surpassing current state-of-the-art by 12.72% and 12.37% on LEVIR-CD, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hylog: A Hybrid Approach to Logging Text Production in Non-alphabetic Scripts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17753</link><description>arXiv:2601.17753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research keyloggers are essential for cognitive studies of text production, yet most fail to capture the on-screen transformations performed by Input Method Editors (IMEs) for non-alphabetic scripts. To address this methodological gap, we present Hylog, a novel hybrid logging system that combines analytical keylogging with ecological text logging for a more complete and finer-grained analysis. Our modular, open-source system uses plug-ins for standard applications (Microsoft Word, Google Chrome) to capture both keyboard output and rendered text, which a hybridizer module then synchronizes into a dual trace. To validate the system's technical feasibility and demonstrate its analytical capabilities, we conducted a proof-of-concept study where two volunteers translated a text into simplified Chinese. Hylog successfully captured keypresses and temporal intervals between Latin letters, Chinese characters, and IME confirmations -- some measurements invisible to traditional keyloggers. The resulting data enable the formulation of new, testable hypotheses about the cognitive restrictions and affordances at different linguistic layers in IME-mediated typing.

Initially designed for AI, the WSE architecture is also well-suited for High Performance Computing (HPC). However, its distributed asynchronous programming model diverges significantly from the simple sequential or bulk-synchronous programs that one would typically derive for a given mathematical program description. Targeting the WSE requires a bespoke re-implementation when porting existing code. The absence of WSE support in compilers such as MLIR, meant that there was little hope for automating this process.
  Stencils are ubiquitous in HPC, and in this paper we explore the hypothesis that domain specific information about stencils can be leveraged by the compiler to automatically target the WSE without requiring application-level code changes. We present a compiler pipeline that transforms stencil-based kernels into highly optimized CSL code for the WSE, bridging the semantic gap between the mathematical representation of the problem and the WSE's asynchronous execution model. Based upon five benchmarks across three HPC programming technologies, running on both the Cerebras WSE2 and WSE3, our approach delivers comparable, if not slightly better, performance than manually optimized code. Furthermore, without requiring any application level code changes, performance on the WSE3 is around 14 times faster than 128 Nvidia A100 GPUs and 20 times faster than 128 nodes of a CPU-based Cray-EX supercomputer when using our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17754v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProGraph-R1: Progress-aware Reinforcement Learning for Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17755</link><description>arXiv:2601.17755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has been successfully applied in various knowledge-intensive question answering tasks by organizing external knowledge into structured graphs of entities and relations. It enables large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning beyond text-chunk retrieval. Recent works have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to train agentic GraphRAG frameworks that perform iterative interactions between LLMs and knowledge graphs. However, existing RL-based frameworks such as Graph-R1 suffer from two key limitations: (1) they primarily depend on semantic similarity for retrieval, often overlooking the underlying graph structure, and (2) they rely on sparse, outcome-level rewards, failing to capture the quality of intermediate retrieval steps and their dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose ProGraph-R1, a progress-aware agentic framework for graph-based retrieval and multi-step reasoning. ProGraph-R1 introduces a structure-aware hypergraph retrieval mechanism that jointly considers semantic relevance and graph connectivity, encouraging coherent traversal along multi-hop reasoning paths. We also design a progress-based step-wise policy optimization, which provides dense learning signals by modulating advantages according to intermediate reasoning progress within a graph, rather than relying solely on final outcomes. Experiments on multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate that ProGraph-R1 consistently improves reasoning accuracy and generation quality over existing GraphRAG methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17755v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MV-S2V: Multi-View Subject-Consistent Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17756</link><description>arXiv:2601.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Subject-to-Video Generation (S2V) methods have achieved high-fidelity and subject-consistent video generation, yet remain constrained to single-view subject references. This limitation renders the S2V task reducible to an S2I + I2V pipeline, failing to exploit the full potential of video subject control. In this work, we propose and address the challenging Multi-View S2V (MV-S2V) task, which synthesizes videos from multiple reference views to enforce 3D-level subject consistency. Regarding the scarcity of training data, we first develop a synthetic data curation pipeline to generate highly customized synthetic data, complemented by a small-scale real-world captured dataset to boost the training of MV-S2V. Another key issue lies in the potential confusion between cross-subject and cross-view references in conditional generation. To overcome this, we further introduce Temporally Shifted RoPE (TS-RoPE) to distinguish between different subjects and distinct views of the same subject in reference conditioning. Our framework achieves superior 3D subject consistency w.r.t. multi-view reference images and high-quality visual outputs, establishing a new meaningful direction for subject-driven video generation.

Abstract: Real-world perception and interaction are inherently multimodal, encompassing not only language but also vision and speech, which motivates the development of "Omni" MLLMs that support both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs. While a sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17761v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent End-to-End Vulnerability Management for Mitigating Recurring Vulnerabilities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17762</link><description>arXiv:2601.17762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software vulnerability management has become increasingly critical as modern systems scale in size and complexity. However, existing automated approaches remain insufficient. Traditional static analysis methods struggle to precisely capture contextual dependencies, especially when vulnerabilities span multiple functions or modules. Large language models (LLMs) often lack the ability to retrieve and exploit sufficient contextual information, resulting in incomplete reasoning and unreliable outcomes. Meanwhile, recurring vulnerabilities emerge repeatedly due to code reuse and shared logic, making historical vulnerability knowledge an indispensable foundation for effective vulnerability detection and repair. Nevertheless, prior approaches such as clone-based detection and patch porting, have not fully leveraged this knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MAVM, a multi-agent framework for end-to-end recurring vulnerability management. MAVM integrates five components, including a vulnerability knowledge base, detection, confirmation, repair, and validation, into a unified multi-agent pipeline. We construct a knowledge base from publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, thereby addressing the underuse of historical knowledge in prior work and mitigating the lack of domain-specific expertise in LLMs. Furthermore, we design context-retrieval tools that allow agents to extract and reason over repository-level information, overcoming the contextual limitations of previous methods. Based on agents, MAVM effectively simulates real-world security workflows. To evaluate the performance of MAVM, we construct a dataset containing 78 real-world patch-porting cases (covering 114 function-level migrations). On this dataset, MAVM successfully detects and repairs 51 real vulnerabilities, outperforming baselines by 31.9%-45.2% in repair accuracy, which demonstrates its effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17762v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Lingual Probing and Community-Grounded Analysis of Gender Bias in Low-Resource Bengali</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17764</link><description>arXiv:2601.17764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in recent years; yet, issues of intrinsic gender bias persist, especially in non-English languages. Although current research mostly emphasizes English, the linguistic and cultural biases inherent in Global South languages, like Bengali, are little examined. This research seeks to examine the characteristics and magnitude of gender bias in Bengali, evaluating the efficacy of current approaches in identifying and alleviating bias. We use several methods to extract gender-biased utterances, including lexicon-based mining, computational classification models, translation-based comparison analysis, and GPT-based bias creation. Our research indicates that the straight application of English-centric bias detection frameworks to Bengali is severely constrained by language disparities and socio-cultural factors that impact implicit biases. To tackle these difficulties, we executed two field investigations inside rural and low-income areas, gathering authentic insights on gender bias. The findings demonstrate that gender bias in Bengali presents distinct characteristics relative to English, requiring a more localized and context-sensitive methodology. Additionally, our research emphasizes the need of integrating community-driven research approaches to identify culturally relevant biases often neglected by automated systems. Our research enhances the ongoing discussion around gender bias in AI by illustrating the need to create linguistic tools specifically designed for underrepresented languages. This study establishes a foundation for further investigations into bias reduction in Bengali and other Indic languages, promoting the development of more inclusive and fair NLP systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17764v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HyCARD-Net: A Synergistic Hybrid Intelligence Framework for Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17767</link><description>arXiv:2601.17767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the foremost cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for intelligent and data-driven diagnostic tools. Traditional predictive models often struggle to generalize across heterogeneous datasets and complex physiological patterns. To address this, we propose a hybrid ensemble framework that integrates deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), with classical machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), using an ensemble voting mechanism. This approach combines the representational power of deep networks with the interpretability and efficiency of traditional models. Experiments on two publicly available Kaggle datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance, reaching 82.30 percent accuracy on Dataset I and 97.10 percent on Dataset II, with consistent gains in precision, recall, and F1-score. These findings underscore the robustness and clinical potential of hybrid AI frameworks for predicting cardiovascular disease and facilitating early intervention. Furthermore, this study directly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by promoting early diagnosis, prevention, and management of non-communicable diseases through innovative, data-driven healthcare solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17767v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-42: Enabling Determinism in LLM Inference with Verified Speculation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17768</link><description>arXiv:2601.17768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In LLM inference, the same prompt may yield different outputs across different runs. At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism.
  Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions. Leveraging these insights, LLM-42 decodes tokens using a non-deterministic fast path and enforces determinism via a lightweight verify-rollback loop. The verifier replays candidate tokens under a fixed-shape reduction schedule, commits those that are guaranteed to be consistent across runs, and rolls back those violating determinism. LLM-42 mostly re-uses existing kernels unchanged and incurs overhead only in proportion to the traffic that requires determinism.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17768v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reflexa: Uncovering How LLM-Supported Reflection Scaffolding Reshapes Creativity in Creative Coding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17769</link><description>arXiv:2601.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creative coding requires continuous translation between evolving concepts and computational artifacts, making reflection essential yet difficult to sustain. Creators often struggle to manage ambiguous intentions, emergent outputs, and complex code, limiting depth of exploration. This work examines how large language models (LLMs) can scaffold reflection not as isolated prompts, but as a system-level mechanism shaping creative regulation. From formative studies with eight expert creators, we derived reflection challenges and design principles that informed Reflexa, an integrated scaffold combining dialogic guidance, visualized version navigation, and iterative suggestion pathways. A within-subject study with 18 participants provides an exploratory mechanism validation, showing that structured reflection patterns mediate the link between AI interaction and creative outcomes. These reflection trajectories enhanced perceived controllability, broadened exploration, and improved originality and aesthetic quality. Our findings advance HCI understanding of reflection from LLM-assisted creative practices, and provide design strategies for building LLM-based creative tools that support richer human-AI co-creativity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17769v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling hidden features of social evolution by inferring Langevin dynamics from data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17772</link><description>arXiv:2601.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are there hidden dynamical common patterns in the evolution of social and cultural history? While the growing availability of digitized social data invites us to answer this question, prevailing quantitative methods often rely on deterministic snapshots or average effects. Such approaches overlook the continuous and inherently uncertain nature of historical trajectories. In this paper, we propose a framework for modeling historical dynamics as stochastic processes described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By viewing historical change through the lens of continuous-time dynamics, this framework provides a natural language to describe how structural trends and inherent random fluctuations interact to shape societal evolution. This approach allows us to handle the uncertainty in fragmentary historical records, moving beyond the dichotomy of structural determinism versus pure chance. We demonstrate that adopting this stochastic perspective unlocks a rich suite of analytical capabilities unavailable to static models. Specifically, we introduce methods to: (1) quantify the irreversibility; (2) detect exogenous perturbations; (3) perform multiple imputation for missing historical records. This framework offers a unified methodology for dissecting the stability, contingency, and dynamics of historical change.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17772v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CondenseGraph: Communication-Efficient Distributed GNN Training via On-the-Fly Graph Condensation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17774</link><description>arXiv:2601.17774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN) training suffers from substantial communication overhead due to the inherent neighborhood dependency in graph-structured data. This neighbor explosion problem requires workers to frequently exchange boundary node features across partitions, creating a communication bottleneck that severely limits training scalability. Existing approaches rely on static graph partitioning strategies that cannot adapt to dynamic network conditions. In this paper, we propose CondenseGraph, a novel communication-efficient framework for distributed GNN training. Our key innovation is an on-the-fly graph condensation mechanism that dynamically compresses boundary node features into compact super nodes before transmission. To compensate for the information loss introduced by compression, we develop a gradient-based error feedback mechanism that maintains convergence guarantees while reducing communication volume by 40-60%. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CondenseGraph achieves comparable accuracy to full-precision baselines while significantly reducing communication costs and training time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17774v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DPI: Exploiting Parameter Heterogeneity for Interference-Free Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17777</link><description>arXiv:2601.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a crucial step for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, conflicting objectives across heterogeneous SFT tasks often induce the "seesaw effect": optimizing for one task may degrade performance on others, particularly when model parameters are updated indiscriminately. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to disentangle and isolate task-specific parameter regions, motivated by the hypothesis that parameter heterogeneity underlies cross-task interference. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune LLMs on diverse SFT tasks and identify each task's core parameter region as the subset of parameters exhibiting the largest updates. Tasks with highly overlapping core parameter regions are merged for joint training, while disjoint tasks are organized into different stages. During multi-stage SFT, core parameters acquired in prior tasks are frozen, thereby preventing overwriting by subsequent tasks. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conducted intensive experiments on multiple public datasets. The results showed that our dynamic parameter isolation strategy consistently reduced data conflicts and achieved consistent performance improvements compared to multi-stage and multi-task tuning baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17777v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Controlling Reading Ease with Gaze-Guided Text Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17781</link><description>arXiv:2601.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The way our eyes move while reading can tell us about the cognitive effort required to process the text. In the present study, we use this fact to generate texts with controllable reading ease. Our method employs a model that predicts human gaze patterns to steer language model outputs towards eliciting certain reading behaviors. We evaluate the approach in an eye-tracking experiment with native and non-native speakers of English. The results demonstrate that the method is effective at making the generated texts easier or harder to read, measured both in terms of reading times and perceived difficulty of the texts. A statistical analysis reveals that the changes in reading behavior are mostly due to features that affect lexical processing. Possible applications of our approach include text simplification for information accessibility and generation of personalized educational material for language learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17781v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Shortcut Learning in Binary Classifier Black Boxes: Applications to Voice Anti-Spoofing and Biometrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17782</link><description>arXiv:2601.17782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of deep-learning models in data-driven applications has drawn attention to the potential risks associated with biased datasets and models. Neglected or hidden biases within datasets and models can lead to unexpected results. This study addresses the challenges of dataset bias and explores ``shortcut learning'' or ``Clever Hans effect'' in binary classifiers. We propose a novel framework for analyzing the black-box classifiers and for examining the impact of both training and test data on classifier scores. Our framework incorporates intervention and observational perspectives, employing a linear mixed-effects model for post-hoc analysis. By evaluating classifier performance beyond error rates, we aim to provide insights into biased datasets and offer a comprehensive understanding of their influence on classifier behavior. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through experiments on audio anti-spoofing and speaker verification tasks using both statistical models and deep neural networks. The insights gained from this study have broader implications for tackling biases in other domains and advancing the field of explainable artificial intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17782v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Performance Analysis of Quantum-Secure Digital Signature Algorithms in Blockchain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17785</link><description>arXiv:2601.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term security of public blockchains strictly depends on the hardness assumptions of the underlying digital signature schemes. In the current scenario, most deployed cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms rely on elliptic-curve cryptography, which is vulnerable to quantum attacks due to Shor's algorithm. Therefore, it is important to understand how post-quantum (PQ) digital signatures behave when integrated into real blockchain systems. This report presents a blockchain prototype that supports multiple quantum-secure signature algorithms, focusing on CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon and Hawk as lattice-based schemes. This report also describes the design of the prototype and discusses the performance metrics, which include key generation, signing, verification times, key sizes and signature sizes. This report covers the problem, background, and experimental methodology, also providing a detailed comparison of quantum-secure signatures in a blockchain context and extending the analysis to schemes such as HAETAE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17785v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond a Single Perspective: Text Anomaly Detection with Multi-View Language Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17786</link><description>arXiv:2601.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text anomaly detection (TAD) plays a critical role in various language-driven real-world applications, including harmful content moderation, phishing detection, and spam review filtering. While two-step "embedding-detector" TAD methods have shown state-of-the-art performance, their effectiveness is often limited by the use of a single embedding model and the lack of adaptability across diverse datasets and anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose to exploit the embeddings from multiple pretrained language models and integrate them into $MCA^2$, a multi-view TAD framework. $MCA^2$ adopts a multi-view reconstruction model to effectively extract normal textual patterns from multiple embedding perspectives. To exploit inter-view complementarity, a contrastive collaboration module is designed to leverage and strengthen the interactions across different views. Moreover, an adaptive allocation module is developed to automatically assign the contribution weight of each view, thereby improving the adaptability to diverse datasets. Extensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of $MCA^2$ against strong baselines. The source code of $MCA^2$ is available at https://github.com/yankehan/MCA2.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17786v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Token-Weighted Multi-Target Learning for Generative Recommenders with Curriculum Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17787</link><description>arXiv:2601.17787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommender systems have recently attracted attention by formulating next-item prediction as an autoregressive sequence generation task. However, most existing methods optimize standard next-token likelihood and implicitly treat all tokens as equally informative, which is misaligned with semantic-ID-based generation. Accordingly, we propose two complementary information-gain-based token-weighting strategies tailored to generative recommendation with semantic IDs. Front-Greater Weighting captures conditional semantic information gain by prioritizing early tokens that most effectively reduce candidate-item uncertainty given their prefixes and encode coarse semantics. Frequency Weighting models marginal information gain under long-tailed item and token distributions, upweighting rare tokens to counteract popularity bias. Beyond individual strategies, we introduce a multi-target learning framework with curriculum learning that jointly optimizes the two token-weighted objectives alongside standard likelihood, enabling stable optimization and adaptive emphasis across training stages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines and existing token-weighting approaches, with improved robustness, strong generalization across different semantic-ID constructions, and substantial gains on both head and tail items.

Abstract: A fundamental problem of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to important applications is that LLMs do not always follow instructions, and violations are often hard to observe or check. In LLM-based agentic workflows, such violations can propagate and amplify along reasoning chains, causing task failures and system incidents. This paper presents NSVIF, a neuro-symbolic framework for verifying whether an LLM's output follows the instructions used to prompt the LLM. NSVIF is a universal, general-purpose verifier; it makes no assumption about the instruction or the LLM. NSVIF formulates instruction-following verification as a constraint-satisfaction problem by modeling user instructions as constraints. NSVIF models both logical and semantic constraints; constraint solving is done by a unified solver that orchestrates logical reasoning and semantic analysis. To evaluate NSVIF, we develop VIFBENCH, a new benchmark for instruction-following verifiers with fine-grained data labels. Experiments show that NSVIF significantly outperforms LLM-based approaches and provides interpretable feedback. We also show that feedback from NSVIF helps improve LLMs' instruction-following capability without post-training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17789v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agreement-Driven Multi-View 3D Reconstruction for Live Cattle Weight Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17791</link><description>arXiv:2601.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate cattle live weight estimation is vital for livestock management, welfare, and productivity. Traditional methods, such as manual weighing using a walk-over weighing system or proximate measurements using body condition scoring, involve manual handling of stock and can impact productivity from both a stock and economic perspective. To address these issues, this study investigated a cost-effective, non-contact method for live weight calculation in cattle using 3D reconstruction. The proposed pipeline utilized multi-view RGB images with SAM 3D-based agreement-guided fusion, followed by ensemble regression. Our approach generates a single 3D point cloud per animal and compares classical ensemble models with deep learning models under low-data conditions. Results show that SAM 3D with multi-view agreement fusion outperforms other 3D generation methods, while classical ensemble models provide the most consistent performance for practical farm scenarios (R$^2$ = 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, MAPE = 2.22 $\pm$ 0.56 \%), making this practical for on-farm implementation. These findings demonstrate that improving reconstruction quality is more critical than increasing model complexity for scalable deployment on farms where producing a large volume of 3D data is challenging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17791v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Novel Product Manifold Modeling and Orthogonality-Constrained Neural Network Solver for Parameterized Generalized Inverse Eigenvalue Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17798</link><description>arXiv:2601.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parameterized orthogonality-constrained neural network is proposed for the first time to solve the parameterized generalized inverse eigenvalue problem (PGIEP) on product manifolds, offering a new perspective to address PGIEP. The key contributions are twofold. First, we construct a novel model for the PGIEP, where the optimization variables are located on the product of a Stiefel manifold and a Euclidean manifold. This model enables the application of optimization algorithms on the Stiefel manifold, a capability that is not achievable with existing models. Additionally, the gradient Lipschitz continuity of the objective function is proved. Second, a parameterized Stiefel multilayer perceptron (P-SMLP) that incorporates orthogonality constraints is proposed. Through hard constraints, P-SMLP enables end-to-end training without the need of alternating training between the two manifolds, providing a robust computational framework for generic PGIEPs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17798v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Computational Extraction of Non-Enhancing Hypercellular Tumor Regions from Clinical Imaging Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17802</link><description>arXiv:2601.17802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of non-enhancing hypercellular (NEH) tumor regions is an unmet need in neuro-oncological imaging, with significant implications for patient management and treatment planning. We present a robust computational framework that generates probability maps of NEH regions from routine MRI data, leveraging multiple network architectures to address the inherent variability and lack of clear imaging boundaries. Our approach was validated against independent clinical markers -- relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and enhancing tumor recurrence location (ETRL) -- demonstrating both methodological robustness and biological relevance. This framework enables reliable, non-invasive mapping of NEH tumor compartments, supporting their integration as imaging biomarkers in clinical workflows and advancing precision oncology for brain tumor patients.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17802v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] @NTT: Algorithm-Targeted NTT hardware acceleration via Design-Time Constant Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17806</link><description>arXiv:2601.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a critical computational bottleneck in many lattice-based postquantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, the NTT of a polynomial of degree N - 1 can be computed with a time complexity of O(N log N). Hardware implementation of NTT is generally preferred over software ones, as the latter are significantly slower due to complex memory access patterns and modular arithmetic operations. Achieving maximum throughput in hardware, however, typically demands a prohibitively large number of butterfly unit instantiations. In this work, we propose @NTT, which exploits the fact that the ring parameters in these algorithms are fixed, enabling design-time constant optimization and achieving the maximum throughput of N-point NTT per clock cycle with a compact hardware footprint. Our case study on the Dilithium NTT, implemented using the TSMC 28 nm library, operates at a clock frequency of 1.0 GHz with an area of 1.45 mm^2. On FPGA, the design achieves a throughput-per-LUT that is 5.2x higher than the state-of-the-art implementation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Motif Diversity in Human Liver ChIP-seq Data Using MAP-Elites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17808</link><description>arXiv:2601.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motif discovery is a core problem in computational biology, traditionally formulated as a likelihood optimization task that returns a single dominant motif from a DNA sequence dataset. However, regulatory sequence data admit multiple plausible motif explanations, reflecting underlying biological heterogeneity. In this work, we frame motif discovery as a quality-diversity problem and apply the MAP-Elites algorithm to evolve position weight matrix motifs under a likelihood-based fitness objective while explicitly preserving diversity across biologically meaningful dimensions. We evaluate MAP-Elites using three complementary behavioral characterizations that capture trade-offs between motif specificity, compositional structure, coverage, and robustness. Experiments on human CTCF liver ChIP-seq data aligned to the human reference genome compare MAP-Elites against a standard motif discovery tool, MEME, under matched evaluation criteria across stratified dataset subsets. Results show that MAP-Elites recovers multiple high-quality motif variants with fitness comparable to MEME's strongest solutions while revealing structured diversity obscured by single-solution approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17808v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Multi-Modal Fusion Platform for Joint Environment Sensing and Channel Sounding in Highly Dynamic Scenarios</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17809</link><description>arXiv:2601.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G system is evolving toward full-spectrum coverage,ultra-wide bandwidth, and high mobility, resulting in increasingly complex propagation environments. The deep integration of communication and sensing is widely recognized as a core 6G vision, underscoring the importance of comprehensive environment awareness. Accurate channel modeling forms the foundation of 6G system design and optimization, and channel sounders provide the essential empirical basis. However, existing channel sounders, although supporting wide bandwidth and large antenna arrays in selected bands, generally lack cross-band capability, struggle in dynamic scenarios, and provide limited environmental awareness. The absence of detailed environmental information restricts the development of environment-aware channel models. To address this gap, we propose a multi-modal sensing and channel sounding fusion platform that enables temporally and spatially synchronized acquisition of images, point clouds, geolocation information, and multi-band multi-antenna channel data. The modular architecture facilitates rapid deployment in diverse dynamic environments. The platform supports Sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands with up to 1 GHz bandwidth and 1 ns delay resolution, enabling multi-antenna measurements with a channel switching rate of 8 ms. Moreover, it achieves centimeter-level and 360{\deg} environmental sensing accuracy and meter-level positioning accuracy. Key performance metrics of the platform, including dynamic range, phase stability, delay resolution, and multimodal data synchronization, are validated through vehicle-to-infrastructure measurement campaign. The established platform supports environment-channel joint modeling, enabling analysis and optimization of channel models in dynamic 6G scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17809v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Do We Evaluate Experiences in Immersive Environments?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17811</link><description>arXiv:2601.17811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do we evaluate experiences in immersive environments? Despite decades of research in immersive technologies such as virtual reality, the field remains fragmented. Studies rely on overlapping constructs, heterogeneous instruments, and little agreement on what counts as immersive experience. To better understand this landscape, we conducted a bottom-up scoping review of 375 papers published in ACM CHI, UIST, VRST, SUI, IEEE VR, ISMAR, and TVCG. Our analysis reveals that evaluation practices are often domain- and purpose-specific, shaped more by local choices than by shared standards. Yet this diversity also points to new directions. Instead of multiplying instruments, researchers benefit from integrating and refining them into smarter measures. Rather than focusing only on system outputs, evaluations must center the user's lived experience. Computational modeling offers opportunities to bridge signals across methods, but lasting progress requires open and sustainable evaluation practices that support comparability and reuse. Ultimately, our contribution is to map current practices and outline a forward-looking agenda for immersive experience research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17811v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Delay-Compensated Stiffness Estimation for Robot-Mediated Dyadic Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17812</link><description>arXiv:2601.17812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot-mediated human-human (dyadic) interactions enable therapists to provide physical therapy remotely, yet an accurate perception of patient stiffness remains challenging due to network-induced haptic delays. Conventional stiffness estimation methods, which neglect delay, suffer from temporal misalignment between force and position signals, leading to significant estimation errors as delays increase. To address this, we propose a robust, delay-compensated stiffness estimation framework by deriving an algebraic estimator based on quasi-static equilibrium that explicitly accounts for temporally aligning the expert's input with the novice's response. A Normalised Weighted Least Squares (NWLS) implementation is then introduced to robustly filter dynamic bias resulting from the algebraic derivation. Experiments using commercial rehabilitation robots (H-MAN) as the platform demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the standard estimator, maintaining consistent tracking accuracy under multiple introduced delays. These findings offer a promising solution for achieving high-fidelity haptic perception in remote dyadic interaction, potentially facilitating reliable stiffness assessment in therapeutic settings across networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17812v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MMR-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal LLM Routing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17814</link><description>arXiv:2601.17814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet heterogeneity in architecture, alignment strategies, and efficiency means that no single model is uniformly superior across tasks. In practical deployments, workloads span lightweight OCR to complex multimodal reasoning; using one MLLM for all queries either over-provisions compute on easy instances or sacrifices accuracy on hard ones. Query-level model selection (routing) addresses this tension, but extending routing from text-only LLMs to MLLMs is nontrivial due to modality fusion, wide variation in computational cost across models, and the absence of a standardized, budget-aware evaluation. We present MMR-Bench, a unified benchmark that isolates the multimodal routing problem and enables comparison under fixed candidate sets and cost models. MMR-Bench provides (i) a controlled environment with modality-aware inputs and variable compute budgets, (ii) a broad suite of vision-language tasks covering OCR, general VQA, and multimodal math reasoning, and (iii) strong single-model reference, oracle upper bounds, and representative routing policies. Using MMR-Bench, we show that incorporating multimodal signals improves routing quality. Empirically, these cues improve the cost-accuracy frontier and enable the routed system to exceed the strongest single model's accuracy at roughly 33% of its cost. Furthermore, policies trained on a subset of models and tasks generalize zero-shot to new datasets and text-only benchmarks without retuning, establishing MMR-Bench as a foundation for studying adaptive multimodal model selection and efficient MLLM deployment. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Hunter-Wrynn/MMR-Bench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17814v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Less Is More: Scalable Visual Navigation from Limited Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17815</link><description>arXiv:2601.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning provides a powerful framework for goal-conditioned visual navigation in mobile robots, enabling obstacle avoidance while respecting human preferences and social norms. However, its effectiveness depends critically on the quality and diversity of training data. In this work, we show how classical geometric planners can be leveraged to generate synthetic trajectories that complement costly human demonstrations. We train Less is More (LiMo), a transformer-based visual navigation policy that predicts goal-conditioned SE(2) trajectories from a single RGB observation, and find that augmenting limited expert demonstrations with planner-generated supervision yields substantial performance gains. Through ablations and complementary qualitative and quantitative analyses, we characterize how dataset scale and diversity affect planning performance. We demonstrate real-robot deployment and argue that robust visual navigation is enabled not by simply collecting more demonstrations, but by strategically curating diverse, high-quality datasets. Our results suggest that scalable, embodiment-specific geometric supervision is a practical path toward data-efficient visual navigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17815v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Collaborative Intrusion Detection for Low-Altitude Economy IoT: An LLM-Enhanced Agentic AI Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17817</link><description>arXiv:2601.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of low-altitude economy Internet of Things (LAE-IoT) networks has created unprecedented security challenges due to dynamic three-dimensional mobility patterns, distributed autonomous operations, and severe resource constraints. Traditional intrusion detection systems designed for static ground-based networks prove inadequate for tackling the unique characteristics of aerial IoT environments, including frequent topology changes, real-time detection requirements, and energy limitations. In this article, we analyze the intrusion detection requirements for LAE-IoT networks, complemented by a comprehensive review of evaluation metrics that cover detection effectiveness, response time, and resource consumption. Then, we investigate transformative potential of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms and introduce a large language model (LLM)-enabled agentic AI framework for enhancing intrusion detection in LAE-IoT networks. This leads to our proposal of a novel multi-agent collaborative intrusion detection framework that leverages specialized LLM-enhanced agents for intelligent data processing and adaptive classification. Through experimental validation, our framework demonstrates superior performance of over 90\% classification accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. These results highlight the transformative potential of combining agentic AI principles with LLMs for next-generation LAE-IoT security systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17817v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ViTCoP: Accelerating Large Vision-Language Models via Visual and Textual Semantic Collaborative Pruning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17818</link><description>arXiv:2601.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) incur high computational costs due to significant redundancy in their visual tokens. To effectively reduce this cost, researchers have proposed various visual token pruning methods. However, existing methods are generally limited, either losing critical visual information prematurely due to pruning in the vision encoder, or leading to information redundancy among the selected tokens due to pruning in the Large Language Models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we propose a Visual and Textual Semantic Collaborative Pruning framework (ViTCoP) that combines redundancy filtering in the vision encoder with step-wise co-pruning within the LLM based on its hierarchical characteristics, to efficiently preserve critical and informationally diverse visual tokens. Meanwhile, to ensure compatibility with acceleration techniques like FlashAttention, we introduce the L2 norm of K-vectors as the token saliency metric in the LLM. Extensive experiments on various Large Vision-Language Models demonstrate that ViTCoP not only achieves state-of-the-art performance surpassing existing methods on both image and video understanding tasks, but also significantly reduces model inference latency and GPU memory consumption. Notably, its performance advantage over other methods becomes even more pronounced under extreme pruning rates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17818v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DIETA: A Decoder-only transformer-based model for Italian-English machine TrAnslation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17823</link><description>arXiv:2601.17823v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Browser-based language models often use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) but typically rely on fixed, outdated indices that give users no control over which sources are consulted. This can lead to answers that mix trusted and untrusted content or draw on stale information. We present OwlerLite, a browser-based RAG system that makes user-defined scopes and data freshness central to retrieval. Users define reusable scopes-sets of web pages or sources-and select them when querying. A freshness-aware crawler monitors live pages, uses a semantic change detector to identify meaningful updates, and selectively re-indexes changed content. OwlerLite integrates text relevance, scope choice, and recency into a unified retrieval model. Implemented as a browser extension, it represents a step toward more controllable and trustworthy web assistants.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17824v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RegGuard: AI-Powered Retrieval-Enhanced Assistant for Pharmaceutical Regulatory Compliance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17826</link><description>arXiv:2601.17826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and complexity of regulatory updates present a significant burden for multinational pharmaceutical companies. Compliance teams must interpret evolving rules across jurisdictions, formats, and agencies, often manually, at high cost and risk of error. We introduce RegGuard, an industrial-scale AI assistant designed to automate the interpretation of heterogeneous regulatory texts and align them with internal corporate policies. The system ingests heterogeneous document sources through a secure pipeline and enhances retrieval and generation quality with two novel components: HiSACC (Hierarchical Semantic Aggregation for Contextual Chunking) semantically segments long documents into coherent units while maintaining consistency across non-contiguous sections. ReLACE (Regulatory Listwise Adaptive Cross-Encoder for Reranking), a domain-adapted cross-encoder built on an open-source model, jointly models user queries and retrieved candidates to improve ranking relevance. Evaluations in enterprise settings demonstrate that RegGuard improves answer quality specifically in terms of relevance, groundedness, and contextual focus, while significantly mitigating hallucination risk. The system architecture is built for auditability and traceability, featuring provenance tracking, access control, and incremental indexing, making it highly responsive to evolving document sources and relevant for any domain with stringent compliance demands.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17826v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aligning Medical Conversational AI through Online Reinforcement Learning with Information-Theoretic Rewards</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17828</link><description>arXiv:2601.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Information Gain Fine-Tuning (IGFT), a novel approach for training medical conversational AI to conduct effective patient interviews and generate comprehensive History of Present Illness (HPI) without requiring pre-collected human conversations. IGFT combines online Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with information-theoretic rewards, enabling models to learn from self-generated conversations with simulated patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on expensive expert-annotated conversations or static datasets, our online RL framework allows models to discover effective questioning strategies through exploration. Our key innovation is an information gain reward function that tracks which clinical entities such as symptoms, temporal patterns, and medical history, are revealed during conversation. Each question's reward is computed based on its expected information gain combined with GPT-4o-mini quality assessments across dimensions including clinical relevance, patient engagement, and specificity. This hybrid approach ensures models learn to ask targeted, clinically appropriate questions that efficiently gather diagnostic information. We fine-tune two models using LoRA: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (a reasoning-optimized model). Training exclusively on Avey data containing concise HPIs, we evaluate generalization to MIMIC data with longer, more elaborate HPIs. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (IGFT) achieves F1 scores of 0.408 on Avey (10.9% improvement over base) and 0.289 on MIMIC (12.9% improvement), while Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (IGFT) reaches 0.384 and 0.336 respectively. Both models outperform OpenAI's model on MIMIC and surpass medical domain-specific baselines like HuatuoGPT and UltraMedical, which were optimized for single-turn medical QA rather than multi-turn conversations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17828v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Linguistic and Argument Diversity in Synthetic Data for Function-Calling Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17829</link><description>arXiv:2601.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of function calling agents has emerged as a promising avenue for extending model capabilities. A major challenge for this task is obtaining high quality diverse data for training. Prior work emphasizes diversity in functions, invocation patterns, and interaction turns, yet linguistic diversity of requests and coverage of arguments (e.g., \texttt{city\_name}, \texttt{stock\_ticker}) remain underexplored. We propose a method that generates synthetic datasets via optimizing general-purpose diversity metrics across both queries and arguments, without relying on hand-crafted rules or taxonomies, making it robust to different usecases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique via both intrinsic and extrinsic testing, comparing it to SoTA data generation methods. We show a superiority over baselines in terms of diversity, while keeping comparable correctness. Additionally, when used as a training set, the model resulting from our dataset exhibits superior performance compared to analogous models based on the baseline data generation methods in out-of-distribution performance. In particular, we achieve an $7.4\%$ increase in accuracy on the BFCL benchmark compared to similar counterparts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17829v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VAE-REPA: Variational Autoencoder Representation Alignment for Efficient Diffusion Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17830</link><description>arXiv:2601.17830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising-based diffusion transformers, despite their strong generation performance, suffer from inefficient training convergence. Existing methods addressing this issue, such as REPA (relying on external representation encoders) or SRA (requiring dual-model setups), inevitably incur heavy computational overhead during training due to external dependencies. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes \textbf{\namex}, a lightweight intrinsic guidance framework for efficient diffusion training. \name leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) features: their reconstruction property ensures inherent encoding of visual priors like rich texture details, structural patterns, and basic semantic information. Specifically, \name aligns the intermediate latent features of diffusion transformers with VAE features via a lightweight projection layer, supervised by a feature alignment loss. This design accelerates training without extra representation encoders or dual-model maintenance, resulting in a simple yet effective pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \name improves both generation quality and training convergence speed compared to vanilla diffusion transformers, matches or outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, and incurs merely 4\% extra GFLOPs with zero additional cost for external guidance models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17830v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Effective and Cost-Efficient Agentic Framework for Ethereum Smart Contract Auditing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17833</link><description>arXiv:2601.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart contract security is paramount, but identifying intricate business logic vulnerabilities remains a persistent challenge because existing solutions consistently fall short: manual auditing is unscalable, static analysis tools are plagued by false positives, and fuzzers struggle to navigate deep logic states within complex systems. Even emerging AI-based methods suffer from hallucinations, context constraints, and a heavy reliance on expensive, proprietary Large Language Models. In this paper, we introduce Heimdallr, an automated auditing agent designed to overcome these hurdles through four core innovations. By reorganizing code at the function level, Heimdallr minimizes context overhead while preserving essential business logic. It then employs heuristic reasoning to detect complex vulnerabilities and automatically chain functional exploits. Finally, a cascaded verification layer validates these findings to eliminate false positives. Notably, this approach achieves high performance on lightweight, open-source models like GPToss-120B without relying on proprietary systems. Our evaluations demonstrate exceptional performance, as Heimdallr successfully reconstructed 17 out of 20 real-world attacks post June 2025, resulting in total losses of $384M, and uncovered 4 confirmed zero-day vulnerabilities that safeguarded $400M in TVL. Compared to SOTA baselines including both official industrial tools and academic tools, Heimdallr at most reduces analysis time by 97.59% and financial costs by 98.77% while boosting detection precision by over 93.66%. Notably, when applied to auditing contests, Heimdallr can achieve a 92.45% detection rate at a negligible cost of $2.31 per 10K LOC. We provide production-ready auditing services and release valuable benchmarks for future work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17833v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Extension of Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication Schemes to the Grid Partition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17834</link><description>arXiv:2601.17834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider polynomial codes for private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM/SDMM).

We design extension operations that can be applied to a large class of OPP code designs to extend them to the GP case. Applying them to existing codes improves upon the state-of-the-art for certain parameters. Additionally, we show that the GP schemes resulting from extension fulfill additional combinatorial constraints, potentially limiting their performance. We illustrate this point by presenting a new GP scheme that does not adhere to these constraints and outperforms the state-of-the-art for a range of parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17834v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unleashing the Potential of Sparse Attention on Long-term Behaviors for CTR Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17836</link><description>arXiv:2601.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the success of large language models (LLMs) has driven the exploration of scaling laws in recommender systems. However, models that demonstrate scaling laws are actually challenging to deploy in industrial settings for modeling long sequences of user behaviors, due to the high computational complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism. Despite various sparse self-attention mechanisms proposed in other fields, they are not fully suited for recommendation scenarios. This is because user behaviors exhibit personalization and temporal characteristics: different users have distinct behavior patterns, and these patterns change over time, with data from these users differing significantly from data in other fields in terms of distribution. To address these challenges, we propose SparseCTR, an efficient and effective model specifically designed for long-term behaviors of users. To be precise, we first segment behavior sequences into chunks in a personalized manner to avoid separating continuous behaviors and enable parallel processing of sequences. Based on these chunks, we propose a three-branch sparse self-attention mechanism to jointly identify users' global interests, interest transitions, and short-term interests. Furthermore, we design a composite relative temporal encoding via learnable, head-specific bias coefficients, better capturing sequential and periodic relationships among user behaviors. Extensive experimental results show that SparseCTR not only improves efficiency but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, it exhibits an obvious scaling law phenomenon, maintaining performance improvements across three orders of magnitude in FLOPs. In online A/B testing, SparseCTR increased CTR by 1.72\% and CPM by 1.41\%.

Abstract: Non-native speakers (NNSs) face significant language barriers in multilingual communication with native speakers (NSs). While AI-mediated communication (AIMC) tools offer efficient one-time assistance, they often overlook opportunities for NNSs' continuous language acquisition. We introduce ChatLearn, an enhanced AIMC system that leverages NNSs' communication difficulties as learning opportunities. Beyond comprehension and expression assistance, ChatLearn simultaneously captures NNSs' language challenges, and subsequently provides them with spaced review as the conversation progresses. We conducted a mixed-methods study using a communication task with 43 NNS-NS pairs, after which ChatLearn NNSs recalled significantly more expressions than the baseline group, while there was no substantial decline in communication experience. Our findings highlight the value of contextual learning in NNS-NS communication, providing a new direction for AIMC systems that foster both immediate collaboration and continuous language development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17837v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EFT-CoT: A Multi-Agent Chain-of-Thought Framework for Emotion-Focused Therapy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17842</link><description>arXiv:2601.17842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Mental Health Question Answering (MHQA) is promising for mitigating resource shortages. However, existing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based approaches predominantly favor a "top-down" rational restructuring, often neglecting clients' embodied experiences and primary emotion processing. To address this, we propose an Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT)-based Multi-Agent Chain-of-Thought framework (EFT-CoT). Adopting a "bottom-up" trajectory, it deconstructs the intervention into a three-stage reasoning flow: "Embodied Perception - Cognitive Exploration - Narrative Intervention." Utilizing eight specialized agents, the system explicitly executes critical components such as somatic awareness mapping, adaptive assessment, core belief extraction, and narrative restructuring. We further constructed "EFT-Instruct," a high-quality dataset via Chain-of-Thought distillation of approximately 67,000 authentic texts, and fine-tuned a specialized model, EFT-LLM. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that EFT-LLM outperforms strong baselines and human responses across metrics like empathy depth and structural professionalism. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of the multi-agent mechanism. The model exhibits superior psychological reasoning, offering an effective pathway for interpretable, high-empathy counseling systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17842v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAICL: Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning for Vision-Language-Model Based EEG Seizure Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17844</link><description>arXiv:2601.17844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding is a critical component of medical diagnostics, rehabilitation engineering, and brain-computer interfaces. However, contemporary decoding methodologies remain heavily dependent on task-specific datasets to train specialized neural network architectures. Consequently, limited data availability impedes the development of generalizable large brain decoding models. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift from conventional signal-based decoding by leveraging large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to analyze EEG waveform plots. By converting multivariate EEG signals into stacked waveform images and integrating neuroscience domain expertise into textual prompts, we demonstrate that foundational VLMs can effectively differentiate between different patterns in the human brain. To address the inherent non-stationarity of EEG signals, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning (RAICL) approach, which dynamically selects the most representative and relevant few-shot examples to condition the autoregressive outputs of the VLM. Experiments on EEG-based seizure detection indicate that state-of-the-art VLMs under RAICL achieved better or comparable performance with traditional time series based approaches. These findings suggest a new direction in physiological signal processing that effectively bridges the modalities of vision, language, and neural activities. Furthermore, the utilization of off-the-shelf VLMs, without the need for retraining or downstream architecture construction, offers a readily deployable solution for clinical applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17844v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are we collaborative yet? A Usability Perspective on Mixnet Latency for Real-Time Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17845</link><description>arXiv:2601.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixnet networks deliberately induce additional latency to communications to provide anonymity. Recent developments have allowed mixnets to reduce their latency from hours to seconds while maintaining the same level of anonymity. As a result, real-time communications are now possible on mixnets. There has been limited research on how users tolerate different levels of delay, and it is unclear what latency levels mixnet operators should choose. Previous studies about latency do not apply to these 'mid-latency' mixnet scenarios. Our paper contributes the first measurement of users' tolerance to real-time applications under mixnet delay. We design a text-based collaborative quiz system to test user response to latency where participants complete a set of question tasks in collaboration with a simulated second user. Different levels of latency are added, analogous to a modern mixnet system. We show that average delay parameters of 1s and 4s maintain usability, a mean delay of 7s shows some difficulty and a mean delay of 10s is detrimental to user experience. Using these delay parameters, mixnet operators can ensure that most types of real-time communication applications are usable. Mixnets thus can balance usability and anonymity without compromising either.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI Personalization Paradox: Personalized AI Increases Superficial Engagement in Reading while Undermines Autonomy and Ownership in Writing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17846</link><description>arXiv:2601.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-assisted writing raises concerns about autonomy and ownership when benefiting writers. Personalization has been proposed as an effective solution while also risking writers' reliance on AI and behavior shifting. For better personalization design, existing studies rely on interaction and information solely within the writing phase; however, few studies have examined how reading behaviors can inform personalized writing. This study investigates the effects of integrating reading highlights for personalization on AI-assisted writing. A between-subjects study with 46 participants revealed that the personalization condition encouraged participants to produce more highlights. However, highlighting unexpectedly shifted from a sense-making strategy to an instrumental act of "feeding the AI," leading to significant reliance on AI and declines in writers' sense of autonomy, ownership, and self-credit. These findings indicate personalization risks in AI-assisted writing, emphasize the importance of personalization strategies, and provide design implications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17846v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Universal Load Balancing Principle and Its Application to Large Language Model Serving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17855</link><description>arXiv:2601.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load balancing-the allocation of work across parallel resources to reduce delay, energy and cost-is a pervasive challenge in science and engineering, from large-scale simulation and data processing to cloud and manufacturing operations. Motivated by the emerging bottleneck in large language model (LLM) serving, we study a particularly stringent regime of load balancing that arises in barrier-synchronized, stateful systems: work cannot be freely migrated and progress is gated by the slowest participant at each step, so heterogeneity and temporal drift in workloads create persistent stragglers and substantial idle time. LLM serving under data-parallel decoding provides a prominent modern instance: in production traces, barrier-induced idle can exceed 40% of compute time per decode step. Here we develop a universal load-balancing principle, which admits a step-wise finite-horizon integer-optimization formulation and yields worst-case guarantees: across LLM decode models and a broader class of non-decreasing workload drift processes, it reduces long-run imbalance by a factor that grows with batch size and system scale. Extensive experiments corroborate the theory, showing substantial improvements in throughput and latency together with reductions in energy consumption. These results provide a general, theoretically grounded framework for load balancing, with immediate implications for sustainable LLM serving and broad relevance to other synchronization-gated resource-allocation problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17855v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SynMind: Reducing Semantic Hallucination in fMRI-Based Image Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17857</link><description>arXiv:2601.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based image reconstruction have achieved remarkable photo-realistic fidelity. Yet, a persistent limitation remains: while reconstructed images often appear naturalistic and holistically similar to the target stimuli, they frequently suffer from severe semantic misalignment -- salient objects are often replaced or hallucinated despite high visual quality. In this work, we address this limitation by rethinking the role of explicit semantic interpretation in fMRI decoding. We argue that existing methods rely too heavily on entangled visual embeddings which prioritize low-level appearance cues -- such as texture and global gist -- over explicit semantic identity. To overcome this, we parse fMRI signals into rich, sentence-level semantic descriptions that mirror the hierarchical and compositional nature of human visual understanding. We achieve this by leveraging grounded VLMs to generate synthetic, human-like, multi-granularity textual representations that capture object identities and spatial organization. Built upon this foundation, we propose SynMind, a framework that integrates these explicit semantic encodings with visual priors to condition a pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynMind outperforms state-of-the-art methods across most quantitative metrics. Notably, by offloading semantic reasoning to our text-alignment module, SynMind surpasses competing methods based on SDXL while using the much smaller Stable Diffusion 1.4 and a single consumer GPU. Large-scale human evaluations further confirm that SynMind produces reconstructions more consistent with human visual perception. Neurovisualization analyses reveal that SynMind engages broader and more semantically relevant brain regions, mitigating the over-reliance on high-level visual areas.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17857v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MergeMix: Optimizing Mid-Training Data Mixtures via Learnable Model Merging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17858</link><description>arXiv:2601.17858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing data mixtures is essential for unlocking the full potential of large language models (LLMs), yet identifying the optimal composition remains computationally prohibitive due to reliance on heuristic trials or expensive proxy training. To address this, we introduce \textbf{MergeMix}, a novel approach that efficiently determines optimal data mixing ratios by repurposing model merging weights as a high-fidelity, low-cost performance proxy. By training domain-specific experts on minimal tokens and optimizing their merging weights against downstream benchmarks, MergeMix effectively optimizes the performance of data mixtures without incurring the cost of full-scale training. Extensive experiments on models with 8B and 16B parameters validate that MergeMix achieves performance comparable to or surpassing exhaustive manual tuning while drastically reducing search costs. Furthermore, MergeMix exhibits high rank consistency (Spearman $\rho &gt; 0.9$) and strong cross-scale transferability, offering a scalable, automated solution for data mixture optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17858v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Space-Air-Ground-Integrated Networks: The BER vs. Residual Delay and Doppler Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17859</link><description>arXiv:2601.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfect Doppler compensation and synchronization is nontrivial due to multi-path Doppler effects and Einstein's theory of relativity in the space-air-ground-integrated networks (SAGINs). Hence, by considering the residual Doppler and the synchronization delay, this paper investigates the bit-error-rate (BER) performance attained under time-varying correlated Shadowed-Rician SAGIN channels. First, a practical SAGIN model is harnessed, encompassing correlated Shadowed-Rician channels, the Snell's law-based path loss, atmospheric absorption, the line-of-sight Doppler compensation, elliptical satellite orbits, and Einstein's theory of relativity. Then, a specific correlation coefficient between the pilot and data symbols is derived in the context of correlated Shadowed-Rician Channels. By exploiting this correlation coefficient, the channel distribution is mimicked by a bi-variate Gamma distribution. Then, a closed-form BER formula is derived under employing least-square channel estimation and equalization for 16-QAM. Our analytical results indicate for a 300-km-altitude LEO that 1) the period of realistic elliptical orbits is around 0.8 seconds longer than that of the idealized circular orbits; and 2) the relativistic delay is lower than 1 $\mu s$ over a full LEO pass (from rise to set). Our numerical results for the L bands quantify the effects of: 1) the residual Doppler; 2) atmospheric shadowing; 3) synchronization errors; and 4) pilot overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17859v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Domain Generalization with Quantum Enhancement for Medical Image Classification: A Lightweight Approach for Cross-Center Deployment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17862</link><description>arXiv:2601.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image artificial intelligence models often achieve strong performance in single-center or single-device settings, yet their effectiveness frequently deteriorates in real-world cross-center deployment due to domain shift, limiting clinical generalizability. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight domain generalization framework with quantum-enhanced collaborative learning, enabling robust generalization to unseen target domains without relying on real multi-center labeled data. Specifically, a MobileNetV2-based domain-invariant encoder is constructed and optimized through three key components: (1) multi-domain imaging shift simulation using brightness, contrast, sharpening, and noise perturbations to emulate heterogeneous acquisition conditions; (2) domain-adversarial training with gradient reversal to suppress domain-discriminative features; and (3) a lightweight quantum feature enhancement layer that applies parameterized quantum circuits for nonlinear feature mapping and entanglement modeling. In addition, a test-time adaptation strategy is employed during inference to further alleviate distribution shifts. Experiments on simulated multi-center medical imaging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline models without domain generalization or quantum enhancement on unseen domains, achieving reduced domain-specific performance variance and improved AUC and sensitivity. These results highlight the clinical potential of quantum-enhanced domain generalization under constrained computational resources and provide a feasible paradigm for hybrid quantum--classical medical imaging systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17862v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] D-Models and E-Models: Diversity-Stability Trade-offs in the Sampling Behavior of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17865</link><description>arXiv:2601.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predictive probability of the next token (P_token) in large language models (LLMs) is inextricably linked to the probability of relevance for the next piece of information, the purchase probability of the next product, and the execution probability of the next action-all of which fall under the scope of the task-level target distribution (P_task). While LLMs are known to generate samples that approximate real-world distributions, whether their fine-grained sampling probabilities faithfully align with task requirements remains an open question. Through controlled distribution-sampling simulations, we uncover a striking dichotomy in LLM behavior, distinguishing two model types: D-models (e.g. Qwen-2.5), whose P_token exhibits large step-to-step variability and poor alignment with P_task; and E-models (e.g. Mistral-Small), whose P_token is more stable and better aligned with P_task. We further evaluate these two model types in downstream tasks such as code generation and recommendation, revealing systematic trade-offs between diversity and stability that shape task outcomes. Finally, we analyze the internal properties of both model families to probe their underlying mechanisms. These findings offer foundational insights into the probabilistic sampling behavior of LLMs and provide practical guidance on when to favor D- versus E-models. For web-scale applications, including recommendation, search, and conversational agents, our results inform model selection and configuration to balance diversity with reliability under real-world uncertainty, providing a better level of interpretation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17865v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MV-SAM: Multi-view Promptable Segmentation using Pointmap Guidance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17866</link><description>arXiv:2601.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promptable segmentation has emerged as a powerful paradigm in computer vision, enabling users to guide models in parsing complex scenes with prompts such as clicks, boxes, or textual cues. Recent advances, exemplified by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have extended this paradigm to videos and multi-view images. However, the lack of 3D awareness often leads to inconsistent results, necessitating costly per-scene optimization to enforce 3D consistency. In this work, we introduce MV-SAM, a framework for multi-view segmentation that achieves 3D consistency using pointmaps -- 3D points reconstructed from unposed images by recent visual geometry models. Leveraging the pixel-point one-to-one correspondence of pointmaps, MV-SAM lifts images and prompts into 3D space, eliminating the need for explicit 3D networks or annotated 3D data. Specifically, MV-SAM extends SAM by lifting image embeddings from its pretrained encoder into 3D point embeddings, which are decoded by a transformer using cross-attention with 3D prompt embeddings. This design aligns 2D interactions with 3D geometry, enabling the model to implicitly learn consistent masks across views through 3D positional embeddings. Trained on the SA-1B dataset, our method generalizes well across domains, outperforming SAM2-Video and achieving comparable performance with per-scene optimization baselines on NVOS, SPIn-NeRF, ScanNet++, uCo3D, and DL3DV benchmarks.

Abstract: Standard Autoregressive Video LLMs inevitably suffer from causal masking biases that hinder global spatiotemporal modeling, leading to suboptimal understanding efficiency.

Extensive experiments show VidLaDA outperforms diffusion baselines and rivals state-of-the-art autoregressive models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA-Video), with MARS-Cache delivering over 12x speedup without compromising reasoning accuracy.

We thus study how language models learn abstract structures and utilize the learnt structural information at test-time. To ensure a controlled setup, we design a natural language dataset based on linguistic structural transformations. We empirically show that the emergence of learning structural information correlates with complex reasoning tasks, and that the ability to perform test-time compositional generation remains limited.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17869v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Comparative Algorithmic Governance of Public Health Instruments across India, EU, US and LMICs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17877</link><description>arXiv:2601.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates the juridico-technological architecture of international public health instruments, focusing on their implementation across India, the European Union, the United States and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. It addresses a research lacuna: the insufficient harmonisation between normative health law and algorithmic public health infrastructures in resource-constrained jurisdictions. The principal objective is to assess how artificial intelligence augments implementation of instruments grounded in IHR 2005 and the WHO FCTC while identifying doctrinal and infrastructural bottlenecks. Using comparative doctrinal analysis and legal-normative mapping, the study triangulates legislative instruments, WHO monitoring frameworks, AI systems including BlueDot, Aarogya Setu and EIOS, and compliance metrics. Preliminary results show that AI has improved early detection, surveillance precision and responsiveness in high-capacity jurisdictions, whereas LMICs face infrastructural deficits, data privacy gaps and fragmented legal scaffolding. The findings highlight the relevance of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act and GDPR as regulatory prototypes for health-oriented algorithmic governance and contrast them with embryonic AI integration and limited internet penetration in many LMICs. The study argues for embedding AI within a rights-compliant, supranationally coordinated regulatory framework to secure equitable health outcomes and stronger compliance. It proposes a model for algorithmic treaty-making inspired by FCTC architecture and calls for WHO-led compliance mechanisms modelled on the WTO Dispute Settlement Body to enhance pandemic preparedness, surveillance equity and transnational governance resilience.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17877v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Manager: Parallel Agent Loop for Long-form Deep Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17879</link><description>arXiv:2601.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form deep research requires multi-faceted investigations over extended horizons to get a comprehensive report. When handling such complex tasks, existing agents manage context at the subtask level to overcome linear context accumulation and information loss. However, they still adhere to a single context window and sequential execution paradigm, which results in mutual interference and blocking behavior, restricting scalability and adaptability. To address this issue, this paper introduces Self-Manager, a parallel agent loop that enables asynchronous and concurrent execution. The main thread can create multiple subthreads, each with its own isolated context, and manage them iteratively through Thread Control Blocks, allowing for more focused and flexible parallel agent execution. To assess its effectiveness, we benchmark Self-Manager on DeepResearch Bench, where it consistently outperforms existing single-agent loop baselines across all metrics. Furthermore, we conduct extensive analytical experiments to demonstrate the necessity of Self-Manager's design choices, as well as its advantages in contextual capacity, efficiency, and generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17879v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quran-MD: A Fine-Grained Multilingual Multimodal Dataset of the Quran</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17880</link><description>arXiv:2601.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Quran MD, a comprehensive multimodal dataset of the Quran that integrates textual, linguistic, and audio dimensions at the verse and word levels. For each verse (ayah), the dataset provides its original Arabic text, English translation, and phonetic transliteration. To capture the rich oral tradition of Quranic recitation, we include verse-level audio from 32 distinct reciters, reflecting diverse recitation styles and dialectical nuances. At the word level, each token is paired with its corresponding Arabic script, English translation, transliteration, and an aligned audio recording, allowing fine-grained analysis of pronunciation, phonology, and semantic context. This dataset supports various applications, including natural language processing, speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, linguistic analysis, and digital Islamic studies. Bridging text and audio modalities across multiple reciters, this dataset provides a unique resource to advance computational approaches to Quranic recitation and study.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), aiming to learn transferable neural representations from large-scale heterogeneous recordings. Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17883v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PEAfowl: Perception-Enhanced Multi-View Vision-Language-Action for Bimanual Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17885</link><description>arXiv:2601.17885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bimanual manipulation in cluttered scenes requires policies that remain stable under occlusions, viewpoint and scene variations. Existing vision-language-action models often fail to generalize because (i) multi-view features are fused via view-agnostic token concatenation, yielding weak 3D-consistent spatial understanding, and (ii) language is injected as global conditioning, resulting in coarse instruction grounding.
  In this paper, we introduce PEAfowl, a perception-enhanced multi-view VLA policy for bimanual manipulation. For spatial reasoning, PEAfowl predicts per-token depth distributions, performs differentiable 3D lifting, and aggregates local cross-view neighbors to form geometrically grounded, cross-view consistent representations. For instruction grounding, we propose to replace global conditioning with a Perceiver-style text-aware readout over frozen CLIP visual features, enabling iterative evidence accumulation. To overcome noisy and incomplete commodity depth without adding inference overhead, we apply training-only depth distillation from a pretrained depth teacher to supervise the depth-distribution head, providing perception front-end with geometry-aware priors.
  On RoboTwin 2.0 under domain-randomized setting, PEAfowl improves the strongest baseline by 23.0 pp in success rate, and real-robot experiments further demonstrate reliable sim-to-real transfer and consistent improvements from depth distillation.

Abstract: Long-term memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to support personalized and sustained interactions. However, most work on personalized agents prioritizes utility and user experience, treating memory as a neutral component and largely overlooking its safety implications. In this paper, we reveal intent legitimation, a previously underexplored safety failure in personalized agents, where benign personal memories bias intent inference and cause models to legitimize inherently harmful queries. To study this phenomenon, we introduce PS-Bench, a benchmark designed to identify and quantify intent legitimation in personalized interactions. Across multiple memory-augmented agent frameworks and base LLMs, personalization increases attack success rates by 15.8%-243.7% relative to stateless baselines. We further provide mechanistic evidence for intent legitimation from internal representations space, and propose a lightweight detection-reflection method that effectively reduces safety degradation. Overall, our work provides the first systematic exploration and evaluation of intent legitimation as a safety failure mode that naturally arises from benign, real-world personalization, highlighting the importance of assessing safety under long-term personal context.

Static analysis is sound but often over-approximates, producing many false positives, whereas machine-learning approaches can improve precision but may sacrifice completeness and generalization. We present iResolveX, a hybrid multi-layered framework that combines conservative static analysis with learning-based refinement. The first layer applies a conservative value-set analysis (BPA) to ensure high recall. The second layer adds a learning-based soft-signature scorer (iScoreGen) and selective inter-procedural backward analysis with memory inspection (iScoreRefine) to reduce false positives. The final output, p-IndirectCFG, annotates indirect edges with confidence scores, enabling downstream analyses to choose appropriate precision--recall trade-offs. Across SPEC CPU2006 and real-world binaries, iScoreGen reduces predicted targets by 19.2% on average while maintaining BPA-level recall (98.2%). Combined with iScoreRefine, the total reduction reaches 44.3% over BPA with 97.8% recall (a 0.4% drop). iResolveX supports both conservative, recall-preserving and F1-optimized configurations and outperforms state-of-the-art systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17888v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physiological and Behavioral Modeling of Stress and Cognitive Load in Web-Based Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17890</link><description>arXiv:2601.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time pressure and question difficulty can trigger stress and cognitive overload in web-based surveys, compromising data quality and user experience. Most stress detection methods are based on low-resolution self-reports, which are poorly suited for capturing fast, moment-to-moment changes during short online tasks. Addressing this gap, we conducted a 2x2 within-subjects study (N = 29), manipulating question difficulty and time pressure in a web-based multiple-choice task. Participants completed general knowledge and cognitive questions while we collected multimodal data: mouse dynamics, eye tracking, electrocardiogram, and electrodermal activity. Using condition-based and self-reported labels, we used statistical and machine learning models to model stress and question difficulty. Our results show distinct physiological and behavioral patterns within very short timeframes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of rapidly detecting cognitive-affective states in digital environments, paving the way for more adaptive, ethical, and user-aware survey interfaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17890v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property Rights: Comparative Transnational Policy Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17892</link><description>arXiv:2601.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence's rapid integration with intellectual property rights necessitates assessment of its impact on trade secrets, copyrights and patents. This study addresses lacunae in existing laws where India lacks AI-specific provisions, creating doctrinal inconsistencies and enforcement inefficacies. Global discourse on AI-IPR protections remains nascent. The research identifies gaps in Indian IP laws' adaptability to AI-generated outputs: trade secret protection is inadequate against AI threats; standardized inventorship criteria are absent. Employing doctrinal and comparative methodology, it scrutinizes legislative texts, judicial precedents and policy instruments across India, US, UK and EU. Preliminary findings reveal shortcomings: India's contract law creates fragmented trade secret regime; Section 3(k) of Indian Patents Act blocks AI invention patenting; copyright varies in authorship attribution. The study proposes harmonized legal taxonomy accommodating AI's role while preserving innovation incentives. India's National AI Strategy (2024) shows progress but legislative clarity is imperative. This contributes to global discourse with AI-specific IP protections ensuring resilience and equitable innovation. Promising results underscore recalibrating India's IP jurisprudence for global alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17892v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Investigating How Music Affects Persuasion, Engagement, and Emotion in Data Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17893</link><description>arXiv:2601.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data videos have become a prominent vessel for communicating data to broad audiences, and a common object of study in information visualization. Many of these videos include music, yet the impact of music on how people experience data videos remains largely unexplored. We conducted a preregistered study into the effect of music across three dimensions: persuasion, engagement, and emotion. We showed online participants an existing data video (1) without any music, (2) with its generic default music, and (3) with custom music designed by a professional composer. We found that the default music helped make the data video more persuasive. However, the effects of custom music were more mixed, and we did not find that music increased engagement. In addition, and contrary to our expectations, our participants reported more intense emotions without music. Our study contributes new insights into the intersection of music and data visualization and is a first step toward guiding designers in creating impactful data-driven narratives.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17893v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Masked Depth Modeling for Spatial Perception</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17895</link><description>arXiv:2601.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial visual perception is a fundamental requirement in physical-world applications like autonomous driving and robotic manipulation, driven by the need to interact with 3D environments. Capturing pixel-aligned metric depth using RGB-D cameras would be the most viable way, yet it usually faces obstacles posed by hardware limitations and challenging imaging conditions, especially in the presence of specular or texture-less surfaces. In this work, we argue that the inaccuracies from depth sensors can be viewed as "masked" signals that inherently reflect underlying geometric ambiguities. Building on this motivation, we present LingBot-Depth, a depth completion model which leverages visual context to refine depth maps through masked depth modeling and incorporates an automated data curation pipeline for scalable training. It is encouraging to see that our model outperforms top-tier RGB-D cameras in terms of both depth precision and pixel coverage. Experimental results on a range of downstream tasks further suggest that LingBot-Depth offers an aligned latent representation across RGB and depth modalities. We release the code, checkpoint, and 3M RGB-depth pairs (including 2M real data and 1M simulated data) to the community of spatial perception.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17895v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniCog: Uncovering Cognitive Abilities of LLMs through Latent Mind Space Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17897</link><description>arXiv:2601.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing body of research suggests that the cognitive processes of large language models (LLMs) differ fundamentally from those of humans. However, existing interpretability methods remain limited in explaining how cognitive abilities are engaged during LLM reasoning. In this paper, we propose UniCog, a unified framework that analyzes LLM cognition via a latent mind space. Formulated as a latent variable model, UniCog encodes diverse abilities from dense model activations into sparse, disentangled latent dimensions. Through extensive analysis on six advanced LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3.2 and GPT-4o, we reveal a Pareto principle of LLM cognition, where a shared reasoning core is complemented by ability-specific signatures. Furthermore, we discover that reasoning failures often manifest as anomalous intensity in latent activations. These findings opens a new paradigm in LLM analysis, providing a cognition grounded view of reasoning dynamics. Finally, leveraging these insights, we introduce a latent-informed candidate prioritization strategy, which improves reasoning performance by up to 7.5% across challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Named entity recognition (NER) is evolving from a sequence labeling task into a generative paradigm with the rise of large language models (LLMs). We conduct a systematic evaluation of open-source LLMs on both flat and nested NER tasks. We investigate several research questions including the performance gap between generative NER and traditional NER models, the impact of output formats, whether LLMs rely on memorization, and the preservation of general capabilities after fine-tuning. Through experiments across eight LLMs of varying scales and four standard NER datasets, we find that: (1) With parameter-efficient fine-tuning and structured formats like inline bracketed or XML, open-source LLMs achieve performance competitive with traditional encoder-based models and surpass closed-source LLMs like GPT-3; (2) The NER capability of LLMs stems from instruction-following and generative power, not mere memorization of entity-label pairs; and (3) Applying NER instruction tuning has minimal impact on general capabilities of LLMs, even improving performance on datasets like DROP due to enhanced entity understanding. These findings demonstrate that generative NER with LLMs is a promising, user-friendly alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Neighborhood search operators are critical to the performance of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) and rely heavily on expert design. Although recent LLM-based Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) methods have made notable progress, they primarily optimize individual heuristics or components independently, lacking explicit exploration and exploitation of dynamic coupling relationships between multiple operators. In this paper, multi-operator optimization in MOEAs is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the improvement of interdependent operators through sequential decision-making. To address this, we propose the Evolution of Operator Combination (E2OC) framework for MOEAs, which achieves the co-evolution of design strategies and executable codes. E2OC employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to progressively search combinations of operator design strategies and adopts an operator rotation mechanism to identify effective operator configurations while supporting the integration of mainstream AHD methods as the underlying designer. Experimental results across AHD tasks with varying objectives and problem scales show that E2OC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AHD and other multi-heuristic co-design frameworks, demonstrating strong generalization and sustained optimization capability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17899v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting 3D Reconstruction Kernels as Low-Pass Filters</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17900</link><description>arXiv:2601.17900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction is to recover 3D signals from the sampled discrete 2D pixels, with the goal to converge continuous 3D spaces. In this paper, we revisit 3D reconstruction from the perspective of signal processing, identifying the periodic spectral extension induced by discrete sampling as the fundamental challenge. Previous 3D reconstruction kernels, such as Gaussians, Exponential functions, and Student's t distributions, serve as the low pass filters to isolate the baseband spectrum. However, their unideal low-pass property results in the overlap of high-frequency components with low-frequency components in the discrete-time signal's spectrum. To this end, we introduce Jinc kernel with an instantaneous drop to zero magnitude exactly at the cutoff frequency, which is corresponding to the ideal low pass filters. As Jinc kernel suffers from low decay speed in the spatial domain, we further propose modulated kernels to strick an effective balance, and achieves superior rendering performance by reconciling spatial efficiency and frequency-domain fidelity. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our Jinc and modulated kernels.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17900v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] dLLM-ASR: A Faster Diffusion LLM-based Framework for Speech Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17902</link><description>arXiv:2601.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on large language models (LLMs) achieve superior performance by leveraging pretrained LLMs as decoders, but their token-by-token generation mechanism leads to inference latency that grows linearly with sequence length. Meanwhile, discrete diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling high-quality parallel sequence generation with pretrained decoders. However, directly applying native text-oriented dLLMs to ASR leads to a fundamental mismatch between open-ended text generation and the acoustically conditioned transcription paradigm required by ASR. As a result, it introduces unnecessary difficulty and computational redundancy, such as denoising from pure noise, inflexible generation lengths, and fixed denoising steps. We propose dLLM-ASR, an efficient dLLM-based ASR framework that formulates dLLM's decoding as a prior-guided and adaptive denoising process. It leverages an ASR prior to initialize the denoising process and provide an anchor for sequence length. Building upon this prior, length-adaptive pruning dynamically removes redundant tokens, while confidence-based denoising allows converged tokens to exit the denoising loop early, enabling token-level adaptive computation. Experiments demonstrate that dLLM-ASR achieves recognition accuracy comparable to autoregressive LLM-based ASR systems and delivers a 4.44$\times$ inference speedup, establishing a practical and efficient paradigm for ASR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17902v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prompt-Based REST API Test Amplification in Industry: An Experience Report</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17903</link><description>arXiv:2601.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support software testing tasks, yet there is little evidence of their effectiveness for REST API testing in industrial settings. To address this gap, we replicate our earlier work on LLM-based REST API test amplification within an industrial context at one of the largest logistics companies in Belgium. We apply LLM-based test amplification to six representative endpoints of a production microservice embedded in a large-scale, security-sensitive system, where there is in-depth complexity in authentication, stateful behavior, and organizational constraints. Our experience shows that LLM-based test amplification remains practically useful in industry by increasing coverage and revealing various observations and anomalies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17903v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feature-Space Generative Models for One-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17905</link><description>arXiv:2601.17905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is a paradigm where a model, initially trained on a dataset of base classes, must adapt to an expanding problem space by recognizing novel classes with limited data. We focus on the challenging FSCIL setup where a model receives only a single sample (1-shot) for each novel class and no further training or model alterations are allowed after the base training phase. This makes generalization to novel classes particularly difficult. We propose a novel approach predicated on the hypothesis that base and novel class embeddings have structural similarity. We map the original embedding space into a residual space by subtracting the class prototype (i.e., the average class embedding) of input samples. Then, we leverage generative modeling with VAE or diffusion models to learn the multi-modal distribution of residuals over the base classes, and we use this as a valuable structural prior to improve recognition of novel classes. Our approach, Gen1S, consistently improves novel class recognition over the state of the art across multiple benchmarks and backbone architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17905v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FARM: Few-shot Adaptive Malware Family Classification under Concept Drift</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17907</link><description>arXiv:2601.17907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware classification models often face performance degradation due to concept drift, arising from evolving threat landscapes and the emergence of novel malware families. This paper presents FARM (Few-shot Adaptive Recognition of Malware), a framework designed to detect and adapt to both covariate and label drift in Windows Portable Executable (PE) malware classification. FARM leverages a triplet autoencoder to project samples into a discriminative latent space, enabling unsupervised drift detection via DBSCAN clustering and dynamic thresholding. For rapid adaptation, it employs few-shot learning using prototype-based classification, requiring only a handful of labeled samples. FARM also supports full retraining when enough drifted samples accumulate, updating the latent space for long-term integration. Experiments on the BenchMFC dataset demonstrate that FARM improves classification performance under covariate drift by 5.6\%, and achieves an average F1 score of 0.85 on unseen malware families using only few-shot adaptation, which further increases to 0.94 after retraining. These results highlight FARM's robustness and adaptability in dynamic malware detection environments under limited supervision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17907v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Statistical Disclosure Control to Fair AI: Navigating Fundamental Tradeoffs in Differential Privacy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17909</link><description>arXiv:2601.17909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy has become the gold standard for privacy-preserving machine learning systems. Unfortunately, subsequent work has primarily fixated on the privacy-utility tradeoff, leaving the subject of fairness constraints undervalued and under-researched. This paper provides a systematic treatment connecting three threads: (1) Dalenius's impossibility results for semantic privacy, (2) Dwork's differential privacy as an achievable alternative, and (3) emerging impossibility results from the addition of a fairness requirement. Through concrete examples and technical analysis, the three-way Pareto frontier between privacy, utility, and fairness is demonstrated to showcase the fundamental limits on what can be simultaneously achieved. In this work, these limits are characterized, the impact on minority groups is demonstrated, and practical guidance for navigating these tradeoffs are provided. This forms a unified framework synthesizing scattered results to help practitioners and policymakers make informed decisions when deploying private fair learning systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17909v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Weighting in Knowledge Distillation: An Axiomatic Framework for Multi-Scale Teacher Ensemble Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17910</link><description>arXiv:2601.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation with multiple teachers is increasingly used to improve robustness, efficiency, and safety, yet existing approaches rely largely on heuristic or implementation-specific weighting schemes. This paper develops an operator-agnostic axiomatic framework for adaptive weighting in multi-teacher knowledge distillation across three complementary scales: token, task, and context. We formalize structural conditions under which adaptive weighting operators are well-defined, admit multiple non-equivalent implementations, and can be hierarchically composed via product-structure normalization. Within this framework, we establish existence and non-uniqueness of conforming operators, characterize convergence of gradient-based optimization under standard assumptions, analyze stability and perturbation robustness, and provide an abstract formulation of safety-constrained distillation. The results decouple theoretical guarantees from specific weighting formulas, enabling principled analysis of adaptive distillation methods under heterogeneity, distribution shift, and safety constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17910v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prompt Injection Evaluations: Refusal Boundary Instability and Artifact-Dependent Compliance in GPT-4-Series Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17911</link><description>arXiv:2601.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt injection evaluations typically treat refusal as a stable, binary indicator of safety. This study challenges that paradigm by modeling refusal as a local decision boundary and examining its stability under structured perturbations. We evaluated two models, GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, using 3,274 perturbation runs derived from refusal-inducing prompt injection attempts. Each base prompt was subjected to 25 perturbations across five structured families, with outcomes manually coded as Refusal, Partial Compliance, or Full Compliance.
  Using chi-square tests, logistic regression, mixed-effects modeling, and a novel Refusal Boundary Entropy (RBE) metric, we demonstrate that while both models refuse &gt;94% of attempts, refusal instability is persistent and non-uniform. Approximately one-third of initial refusal-inducing prompts exhibited at least one "refusal escape," a transition to compliance under perturbation. We find that artifact type is a stronger predictor of refusal failure than perturbation style. Textual artifacts, such as ransomware notes, exhibited significantly higher instability, with flip rates exceeding 20%. Conversely, executable malware artifacts showed zero refusal escapes in both models. While GPT-4o demonstrated tighter refusal enforcement and lower RBE than GPT-4.1, it did not eliminate artifact-dependent risks. These findings suggest that single-prompt evaluations systematically overestimate safety robustness. We conclude that refusal behavior is a probabilistic, artifact-dependent boundary phenomenon rather than a stable binary property, requiring a shift in how LLM safety is measured and audited.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17911v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Pre-training Under the Fairness Lens: An Empirical Study of TabPFN</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17912</link><description>arXiv:2601.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data, such as the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN), are pre-trained on a massive number of synthetic datasets generated by structural causal models (SCM). They leverage in-context learning to offer high predictive accuracy in real-world tasks. However, the fairness properties of these foundational models, which incorporate ideas from causal reasoning during pre-training, have not yet been explored in sufficient depth. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of TabPFN and its fine-tuned variants, assessing predictive performance, fairness, and robustness across varying dataset sizes and distributional shifts. Our results reveal that while TabPFN achieves stronger predictive accuracy compared to baselines and exhibits robustness to spurious correlations, improvements in fairness are moderate and inconsistent, particularly under missing-not-at-random (MNAR) covariate shifts. These findings suggest that the causal pre-training in TabPFN is helpful but insufficient for algorithmic fairness, highlighting implications for deploying such models in practice and the need for further fairness interventions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17912v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Think Locally, Explain Globally: Graph-Guided LLM Investigations via Local Reasoning and Belief Propagation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17915</link><description>arXiv:2601.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM agents excel when environments are mostly static and the needed information fits in a model's context window, but they often fail in open-ended investigations where explanations must be constructed by iteratively mining evidence from massive, heterogeneous operational data. These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.
  We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17915v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniPACT: A Multimodal Framework for Prognostic Question Answering on Raw ECG and Structured EHR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17916</link><description>arXiv:2601.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate clinical prognosis requires synthesizing structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with real-time physiological signals like the Electrocardiogram (ECG). Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a powerful reasoning engine for this task but struggle to natively process these heterogeneous, non-textual data types. To address this, we propose UniPACT (Unified Prognostic Question Answering for Clinical Time-series), a unified framework for prognostic question answering that bridges this modality gap. UniPACT's core contribution is a structured prompting mechanism that converts numerical EHR data into semantically rich text. This textualized patient context is then fused with representations learned directly from raw ECG waveforms, enabling an LLM to reason over both modalities holistically. We evaluate UniPACT on the comprehensive MDS-ED benchmark, it achieves a state-of-the-art mean AUROC of 89.37% across a diverse set of prognostic tasks including diagnosis, deterioration, ICU admission, and mortality, outperforming specialized baselines. Further analysis demonstrates that our multimodal, multi-task approach is critical for performance and provides robustness in missing data scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17916v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] treaming-dLLM: Accelerating Diffusion LLMs via Suffix Pruning and Dynamic Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17917</link><description>arXiv:2601.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer a compelling paradigm for natural language generation, leveraging parallel decoding and bidirectional attention to achieve superior global coherence compared to autoregressive models. While recent works have accelerated inference via KV cache reuse or heuristic decoding, they overlook the intrinsic inefficiencies within the block-wise diffusion process. Specifically, they suffer from spatial redundancy by modeling informative-sparse suffix regions uniformly and temporal inefficiency by applying fixed denoising schedules across all the decoding process. To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, we introduce attenuation guided suffix modeling to approximate the full context by pruning redundant mask tokens. Temporally, we employ a dynamic confidence aware strategy with an early exit mechanism, allowing the model to skip unnecessary iterations for converged tokens. Extensive experiments show that Streaming-dLLM achieves up to 68.2X speedup while maintaining generation quality, highlighting its effectiveness in diffusion decoding.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) hold significant promise for medical applications, yet their deployment is often constrained by insufficient alignment and reliability. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a potent framework for refining model responses, its efficacy in high-stakes medical contexts remains underexplored, lacking the rigorous empirical groundwork necessary to guide future methodological advances. To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive examination of diverse DPO variants within the medical domain, evaluating nine distinct formulations across two medical LVLMs: LLaVA-Med and HuatuoGPT-Vision. Our results reveal several critical limitations: current DPO approaches often yield inconsistent gains over supervised fine-tuning, with their efficacy varying significantly across different tasks and backbones. Furthermore, they frequently fail to resolve fundamental visual misinterpretation errors. Building on these insights, we present a targeted preference construction strategy as a proof-of-concept that explicitly addresses visual misinterpretation errors frequently observed in existing DPO models. This design yields a 3.6% improvement over the strongest existing DPO baseline on visual question-answering tasks. To support future research, we release our complete framework, including all training data, model checkpoints, and our codebase at https://github.com/dmis-lab/med-vlm-dpo.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17918v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic AI for Self-Driving Laboratories in Soft Matter: Taxonomy, Benchmarks,and Open Challenges</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17920</link><description>arXiv:2601.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) close the loop between experiment design, automated execution, and data-driven decision making, and they provide a demanding testbed for agentic AI under expensive actions, noisy and delayed feedback, strict feasibility and safety constraints, and non-stationarity. This survey uses soft matter as a representative setting but focuses on the AI questions that arise in real laboratories. We frame SDL autonomy as an agent environment interaction problem with explicit observations, actions, costs, and constraints, and we use this formulation to connect common SDL pipelines to established AI principles. We review the main method families that enable closed loop experimentation, including Bayesian optimization and active learning for sample efficient experiment selection, planning and reinforcement learning for long horizon protocol optimization, and tool using agents that orchestrate heterogeneous instruments and software. We emphasize verifiable and provenance aware policies that support debugging, reproducibility, and safe operation. We then propose a capability driven taxonomy that organizes systems by decision horizon, uncertainty modeling, action parameterization, constraint handling, failure recovery, and human involvement. To enable meaningful comparison, we synthesize benchmark task templates and evaluation metrics that prioritize cost aware performance, robustness to drift, constraint violation behavior, and reproducibility. Finally, we distill lessons from deployed SDLs and outline open challenges in multi-modal representation, calibrated uncertainty, safe exploration, and shared benchmark infrastructure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17920v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ShapLoRA: Allocation of Low-rank Adaption on Large Language Models via Shapley Value Inspired Importance Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17921</link><description>arXiv:2601.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a representative method in the field of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and is key to Democratizating the modern large language models (LLMs). The vanilla LoRA is implemented with uniform ranks, and the recent literature have found that properly allocating ranks on the LLM backbones results in performance boosts. However, the previous rank allocation methods have limitations since they rely on inexplanable and unreliable importance measures for the LoRA ranks. To address the above issues, we propose the ShapLoRA framework. Inspired by the explanable attribution measure Shapley Value, we combine the sensitivity-based measures with the idea of coalitions in the collaborative games among LoRA ranks, and propose a more explainable importance measure called Shapley sensitivity. In addition, we optimize the workflow of the existing works by: (a) calculating Shapley sensitivity on a separate validation set; (b) Setting up the allocating-retraining procedures for fair comparisons. We have conducted experiments on various challenging tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that our ShapLoRA method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters.\footnote{Codes and fine-tuned models will be open-sourced to facilitate future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17921v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Transferable Skills in Action RPGs via Directed Skill Graphs and Selective Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17923</link><description>arXiv:2601.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifelong agents should expand their competence over time without retraining from scratch or overwriting previously learned behaviors. We investigate this in a challenging real-time control setting (Dark Souls III) by representing combat as a directed skill graph and training its components in a hierarchical curriculum. The resulting agent decomposes control into five reusable skills: camera control, target lock-on, movement, dodging, and a heal-attack decision policy, each optimized for a narrow responsibility. This factorization improves sample efficiency by reducing the burden on any single policy and supports selective post-training: when the environment shifts from Phase 1 to Phase 2, only a subset of skills must be adapted, while upstream skills remain transferable. Empirically, we find that targeted fine-tuning of just two skills rapidly recovers performance under a limited interaction budget, suggesting that skill-graph curricula together with selective fine-tuning offer a practical pathway toward evolving, continually learning agents in complex real-time environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17923v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RemEdit: Efficient Diffusion Editing with Riemannian Geometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17927</link><description>arXiv:2601.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable image generation is fundamental to the success of modern generative AI, yet it faces a critical trade-off between semantic fidelity and inference speed. The RemEdit diffusion-based framework addresses this trade-off with two synergistic innovations. First, for editing fidelity, we navigate the latent space as a Riemannian manifold. A mamba-based module efficiently learns the manifold's structure, enabling direct and accurate geodesic path computation for smooth semantic edits. This control is further refined by a dual-SLERP blending technique and a goal-aware prompt enrichment pass from a Vision-Language Model. Second, for additional acceleration, we introduce a novel task-specific attention pruning mechanism. A lightweight pruning head learns to retain tokens essential to the edit, enabling effective optimization without the semantic degradation common in content-agnostic approaches. RemEdit surpasses prior state-of-the-art editing frameworks while maintaining real-time performance under 50% pruning. Consequently, RemEdit establishes a new benchmark for practical and powerful image editing.

Abstract: The map of elections framework is a methodology for visualizing and analyzing election datasets. So far, the framework was restricted to elections that have equal numbers of candidates, equal numbers of voters, and where all the (ordinal) votes rank all the candidates. We extend it to the case of elections of different sizes, where the votes can be top-truncated.

Abstract: We propose a perspective in which learning is an intrinsically dissipative process. Forgetting and regularization are not heuristic add-ons but structural requirements for adaptive systems. Drawing on information theory, thermodynamics, and information geometry, we introduce the BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures) framework, modeling learning as the evolution of compressed belief states under dissipation constraints.
  A central contribution is the Conditional Optimality Theorem, showing that Fisher-Rao regularization measuring change via information divergence rather than Euclidean distance is the unique thermodynamically optimal regularization strategy, achieving minimal dissipation. Euclidean regularization is shown to be structurally suboptimal. The framework unifies existing methods (Ridge, SIGReg, EMA, SAC) as special cases of a single governing equation.
  Within this view, overfitting corresponds to over-crystallization, while catastrophic forgetting reflects insufficient dissipation control. The framework distinguishes BEDS-crystallizable problems, where beliefs converge to stable equilibria, from BEDS-maintainable problems, which require continual adaptation. It extends naturally to continual and multi-agent systems, where viability, stability under adaptation and finite resources replaces asymptotic optimality as the primary criterion. Overall, this work reframes learning as maintaining viable belief states under dissipation constraints, providing a principled lens on forgetting, regularization, and stability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Specialist to Generalist: Unlocking SAM's Learning Potential on Unlabeled Medical Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17934</link><description>arXiv:2601.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) show strong generalization, yet adapting them to medical images remains difficult due to domain shift, scarce labels, and the inability of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to exploit unlabeled data. While conventional models like U-Net excel in semi-supervised medical learning, their potential to assist a PEFT SAM has been largely overlooked. We introduce SC-SAM, a specialist-generalist framework where U-Net provides point-based prompts and pseudo-labels to guide SAM's adaptation, while SAM serves as a powerful generalist supervisor to regularize U-Net. This reciprocal guidance forms a bidirectional co-training loop that allows both models to effectively exploit the unlabeled data. Across prostate MRI and polyp segmentation benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming other existing semi-supervised SAM variants and even medical foundation models like MedSAM, highlighting the value of specialist-generalist cooperation for label-efficient medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) face a fundamental tension between regulatory compliance and user privacy when detecting cross-institutional money laundering. Current approaches require either sharing sensitive transaction data or operating in isolation, leaving critical cross-chain laundering patterns undetected. We present FedGraph-VASP, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning framework that enables collaborative anti-money laundering (AML) without exposing raw user data. Our key contribution is a Boundary Embedding Exchange protocol that shares only compressed, non-invertible graph neural network representations of boundary accounts. These exchanges are secured using post-quantum cryptography, specifically the NIST-standardized Kyber-512 key encapsulation mechanism combined with AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption. Experiments on the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset with realistic Louvain partitioning show that FedGraph-VASP achieves an F1-score of 0.508, outperforming the state-of-the-art generative baseline FedSage+ (F1 = 0.453) by 12.1 percent on binary fraud detection. We further show robustness under low-connectivity settings where generative imputation degrades performance, while approaching centralized performance (F1 = 0.620) in high-connectivity regimes. We additionally evaluate generalization on an Ethereum fraud detection dataset, where FedGraph-VASP (F1 = 0.635) is less effective under sparse cross-silo connectivity, while FedSage+ excels (F1 = 0.855), outperforming even local training (F1 = 0.785). These results highlight a topology-dependent trade-off: embedding exchange benefits connected transaction graphs, whereas generative imputation can dominate in highly modular sparse graphs. A privacy audit shows embeddings are only partially invertible (R^2 = 0.32), limiting exact feature recovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17935v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Label from Somewhere": Reflexive Annotating for Situated AI Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17937</link><description>arXiv:2601.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI alignment relies on annotator judgments, yet annotation pipelines often treat annotators as interchangeable, obscuring how their social position shapes annotation. We introduce reflexive annotating as a probe that invites crowd workers to reflect on how their positionality informs subjective annotation judgments in a language model alignment context. Through a qualitative study with crowd workers (N=30) and follow-up interviews (N=5), we examine how our probe shapes annotators' behaviour, experience, and the situated metadata it elicits. We find that reflexive annotating captures epistemic metadata beyond static demographics by eliciting intersectional reasoning, surfacing positional humility, and nudging viewpoint change. Crucially, we also denote tensions between reflexive engagement and affective demands such as emotional exposure. We discuss the implications of our work for richer value elicitation and alignment practices that treat annotator judgments as situated and selectively integrate positional metadata.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17937v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DTC: A Deformable Transposed Convolution Module for Medical Image Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17939</link><description>arXiv:2601.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical image segmentation, particularly in UNet-like architectures, upsampling is primarily used to transform smaller feature maps into larger ones, enabling feature fusion between encoder and decoder features and supporting multi-scale prediction. Conventional upsampling methods, such as transposed convolution and linear interpolation, operate on fixed positions: transposed convolution applies kernel elements to predetermined pixel or voxel locations, while linear interpolation assigns values based on fixed coordinates in the original feature map. These fixed-position approaches may fail to capture structural information beyond predefined sampling positions and can lead to artifacts or loss of detail. Inspired by deformable convolutions, we propose a novel upsampling method, Deformable Transposed Convolution (DTC), which learns dynamic coordinates (i.e., sampling positions) to generate high-resolution feature maps for both 2D and 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Experiments on 3D (e.g., BTCV15) and 2D datasets (e.g., ISIC18, BUSI) demonstrate that DTC can be effectively integrated into existing medical image segmentation models, consistently improving the decoder's feature reconstruction and detail recovery capability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17939v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Late Breaking Results: Boosting Efficient Dual-Issue Execution on Lightweight RISC-V Cores</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17940</link><description>arXiv:2601.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale ML accelerators rely on large numbers of PEs, imposing strict bounds on the area and energy budget of each PE. Prior work demonstrates that limited dual-issue capabilities can be efficiently integrated into a lightweight in-order open-source RISC-V core (Snitch), with a geomean IPC boost of 1.6x and a geomean energy efficiency gain of 1.3x, obtained by concurrently executing integer and FP instructions. Unfortunately, this required a complex and error-prone low level programming model (COPIFT). We introduce COPIFTv2 which augments Snitch with lightweight queues enabling direct, fine-grained communication and synchronization between integer and FP threads. By eliminating the tiling and software pipelining steps of COPIFT, we can remove much of its complexity and software overheads. As a result, COPIFTv2 achieves up to a 1.49x speedup and a 1.47x energy-efficiency gain over COPIFT, and a peak IPC of 1.81. Overall, COPIFTv2 significantly enhances the efficiency and programmability of dual-issue execution on lightweight cores. Our implementation is fully open source and performance experiments are reproducible using free software.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-Based SQL Generation: Prompting, Self-Refinement, and Adaptive Weighted Majority Voting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17942</link><description>arXiv:2601.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL has emerged as a prominent research area, particularly with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs). By enabling users to query databases through natural language rather than SQL, this technology significantly lowers the barrier to data analysis. However, generating accurate SQL from natural language remains challenging due to ambiguity in user queries, the complexity of schema linking, limited generalization across SQL dialects, and the need for domain-specific understanding. In this study, we propose a Single-Agent Self-Refinement with Ensemble Voting (SSEV) pipeline built on PET-SQL that operates without ground-truth data, integrating self-refinement with Weighted Majority Voting (WMV) and its randomized variant (RWMA). Experimental results show that the SSEV achieves competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, attaining execution accuracies of 85.5% on Spider 1.0-Dev, 86.4% on Spider 1.0-Test, and 66.3% on BIRD-Dev. Building on insights from the SSEV pipeline, we further propose ReCAPAgent-SQL (Refinement-Critique-Act-Plan agent-based SQL framework) to address the growing complexity of enterprise databases and real-world Text-to-SQL tasks. The framework integrates multiple specialized agents for planning, external knowledge retrieval, critique, action generation, self-refinement, schema linking, and result validation, enabling iterative refinement of SQL predictions through agent collaboration. ReCAPAgent-SQL's WMA results achieve 31% execution accuracy on the first 100 queries of Spider 2.0-Lite, demonstrating significant improvements in handling real-world enterprise scenarios. Overall, our work facilitates the deployment of scalable Text-to-SQL systems in practical settings, supporting better data-driven decision-making at lower cost and with greater efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17942v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Credit Fairness: Online Fairness In Shared Resource Pools</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17944</link><description>arXiv:2601.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a setting in which a group of agents share resources that must be allocated among them in each discrete time period. Agents have time-varying demands and derive constant marginal utility from each unit of resource received up to their demand, with zero utility for any additional resources. In this setting, it is known that independently maximizing the minimum utility in each round satisfies sharing incentives (agents weakly prefer participating in the mechanism to not participating), strategyproofness (agents have no incentive to misreport their demands), and Pareto efficiency (Freeman et al. 2018). However, recent work (Vuppalapati et al. 2023) has shown that this max-min mechanism can lead to large disparities in the total resources received by agents, even when they have the same average demand. In this paper, we introduce credit fairness, a strengthening of sharing incentives that ensures agents who lend resources in early rounds are able to recoup them in later rounds. Credit fairness can be achieved in conjunction with either Pareto efficiency or strategyproofness, but not both. We propose a mechanism that is credit fair and Pareto efficient, and we evaluate its performance in a computational resource-sharing setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17944v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "I use ChatGPT to humanize my words": Affordances and Risks of ChatGPT to Autistic Users</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17946</link><description>arXiv:2601.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots like ChatGPT have emerged as cognitive scaffolding for autistic users, yet the tension between their utility and risk remains under-articulated. Through an inductive thematic analysis of 3,984 social media posts by self-identified autistic users, we apply the Technology Affordance framework to examine this duality. We found that while users leveraged ChatGPT to offload executive dysfunction, regulate emotions, translate neurotypical communication, and validate their autistic identity, these affordances coexist with significant risks: reinforcing delusional thinking, erasing authentic identity through automated masking, and triggering conflicts with the autistic sense of justice. This poster identifies these trade-offs in autistic users' interactions with ChatGPT and concludes by outlining our future work on developing neuro-inclusive technologies that address these tensions through beneficial friction and bidirectional translation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17946v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UPLiFT: Efficient Pixel-Dense Feature Upsampling with Local Attenders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17950</link><description>arXiv:2601.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of task-agnostic feature upsampling has emerged as a promising area of research to efficiently create denser features from pre-trained visual backbones. These methods act as a shortcut to achieve dense features for a fraction of the cost by learning to map low-resolution features to high-resolution versions. While early works in this space used iterative upsampling approaches, more recent works have switched to cross-attention-based methods, which risk falling into the same efficiency scaling problems of the backbones they are upsampling. In this work, we demonstrate that iterative upsampling methods can still compete with cross-attention-based methods; moreover, they can achieve state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs. We propose UPLiFT, an architecture for Universal Pixel-dense Lightweight Feature Transforms. We also propose an efficient Local Attender operator to overcome the limitations of prior iterative feature upsampling methods. This operator uses an alternative attentional pooling formulation defined fully locally. We show that our Local Attender allows UPLiFT to maintain stable features throughout upsampling, enabling state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs than existing pixel-dense feature upsamplers. In addition, we apply UPLiFT to generative downstream tasks and show that it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art Coupled Flow Matching models for VAE feature upsampling. Altogether, UPLiFT offers a versatile and efficient approach to creating denser features.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17950v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Monosemantic Attribution Framework for Stable Interpretability in Clinical Neuroscience Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17952</link><description>arXiv:2601.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability remains a key challenge for deploying large language models (LLMs) in clinical settings such as Alzheimer's disease progression diagnosis, where early and trustworthy predictions are essential. Existing attribution methods exhibit high inter-method variability and unstable explanations due to the polysemantic nature of LLM representations, while mechanistic interpretability approaches lack direct alignment with model inputs and outputs and do not provide explicit importance scores. We introduce a unified interpretability framework that integrates attributional and mechanistic perspectives through monosemantic feature extraction. By constructing a monosemantic embedding space at the level of an LLM layer and optimizing the framework to explicitly reduce inter-method variability, our approach produces stable input-level importance scores and highlights salient features via a decompressed representation of the layer of interest, advancing the safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in cognitive health and neurodegenerative disease.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17952v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Effects and Uncertainty Quantification in Neural Actor Critic Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17954</link><description>arXiv:2601.17954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the neural Actor Critic algorithm using shallow neural networks for both the Actor and Critic models. The focus of this work is twofold: first, to compare the convergence properties of the network outputs under various scaling schemes as the network width and the number of training steps tend to infinity; and second, to provide precise control of the approximation error associated with each scaling regime. Previous work has shown convergence to ordinary differential equations with random initial conditions under inverse square root scaling in the network width. In this work, we shift the focus from convergence speed alone to a more comprehensive statistical characterization of the algorithm's output, with the goal of quantifying uncertainty in neural Actor Critic methods. Specifically, we study a general inverse polynomial scaling in the network width, with an exponent treated as a tunable hyperparameter taking values strictly between one half and one. We derive an asymptotic expansion of the network outputs, interpreted as statistical estimators, in order to clarify their structure. To leading order, we show that the variance decays as a power of the network width, with an exponent equal to one half minus the scaling parameter, implying improved statistical robustness as the scaling parameter approaches one. Numerical experiments support this behavior and further suggest faster convergence for this choice of scaling. Finally, our analysis yields concrete guidelines for selecting algorithmic hyperparameters, including learning rates and exploration rates, as functions of the network width and the scaling parameter, ensuring provably favorable statistical behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17954v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Types for Grassroots Logic Programs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17957</link><description>arXiv:2601.17957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP) is a concurrent logic programming language in which logic variables are partitioned into paired readers and writers. An assignment is produced at most once via a writer and consumed at most once via its paired reader, and may contain additional readers and/or writers. This enables the concise expression of rich multidirectional communication modalities.
  ``Logic Programs as Types for Logic Programs'' (LICS'91) defined types as regular sets of paths over derivable ground atoms. Here, we define types to be regular sets of moded paths, where a mode captures directionality of communication -- whether a subterm is consumed from or produced to the environment -- enabling the typing of interactive partial computations including those that eventually deadlock or fail, or never terminate. We provide a syntactic definition of well-typing and prove that a program is well-typed iff the path abstraction of its moded-atom semantics satisfies covariance and contravariance conditions with respect to its type.
  The GLP type system was implemented in Dart by AI, starting from a mathematical specification of Typed GLP (this paper), deriving from it an English spec (written by AI), and from the spec deriving Dart code (by AI). While GLP is naturally untyped, the motivation for Typed GLP comes from programming with AI: Asking AI to program complex communication modalities in GLP (and in general) and hoping for the best is a tenuous strategy. The emerging discipline we advocate and employ is for the human designer and AI to jointly develop and agree upon (1)~GLP types; (2)~GLP procedure type declarations; (3)~informal (English) descriptions of the procedures; and only then let AI attempt to write (4)~GLP code based on those.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17957v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TensorLens: End-to-End Transformer Analysis via High-Order Attention Tensors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17958</link><description>arXiv:2601.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention matrices are fundamental to transformer research, supporting a broad range of applications including interpretability, visualization, manipulation, and distillation. Yet, most existing analyses focus on individual attention heads or layers, failing to account for the model's global behavior. While prior efforts have extended attention formulations across multiple heads via averaging and matrix multiplications or incorporated components such as normalization and FFNs, a unified and complete representation that encapsulates all transformer blocks is still lacking. We address this gap by introducing TensorLens, a novel formulation that captures the entire transformer as a single, input-dependent linear operator expressed through a high-order attention-interaction tensor. This tensor jointly encodes attention, FFNs, activations, normalizations, and residual connections, offering a theoretically coherent and expressive linear representation of the model's computation. TensorLens is theoretically grounded and our empirical validation shows that it yields richer representations than previous attention-aggregation methods. Our experiments demonstrate that the attention tensor can serve as a powerful foundation for developing tools aimed at interpretability and model understanding.

Abstract: Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is a fundamental practice in middle-school mathematics education; however, student groups frequently stall or struggle without ongoing teacher support. Recent work has explored how Generative AI tools can be designed to support one-on-one tutoring, but little is known about how AI can be designed as peer learning partners in collaborative learning contexts. We conducted a participatory design study with 24 middle school students, who first engaged in mathematics CPS tasks with AI peers in a technology probe, and then collaboratively designed their ideal AI peer. Our findings reveal that students envision an AI peer as competent in mathematics yet explicitly deferential, providing progressive scaffolds such as hints and checks under clear student control. Students preferred a tone of friendly expertise over exaggerated personas. We also discuss design recommendations and implications for AI peers in middle school mathematics CPS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17962v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Lighting The Way For Those Not Here": How Technology Researchers Can Help Fight the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives (MMIR) Crisis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17966</link><description>arXiv:2601.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indigenous peoples across Turtle Island (North America) face disproportionate rates of disappearance and murder, a "genocide" rooted in settler-colonial violence and systemic erasure. Technology plays a crucial role in the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives (MMIR) crisis: perpetuating harm and impeding investigations, yet enabling advocacy and resistance. Communities utilize technologies such as AMBER alerts, news websites, social media groups, and campaigns (like #MMIW, #MMIWR, #NoMoreStolenSisters, and #NoMoreStolenDaughters) to mobilize searches, amplify awareness, and honor missing relatives. Yet, little research in HCI has critically examined technology's role in shaping the MMIR crisis by centering community voices. Through a large-scale study, we analyze 140 webpages to identify systemic, technological, and institutional barriers that hinder communities' efforts, while highlighting socio-technical actions that foster healing and safety. Finally, we amplify Indigenous voices by providing a dataset of stories that resist epistemic erasure, along with recommendations for HCI researchers to support Indigenous-led initiatives with cultural sensitivity, accountability, and self-determination.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17966v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMs as Cultural Archives: Cultural Commonsense Knowledge Graph Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17971</link><description>arXiv:2601.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode rich cultural knowledge learned from diverse web-scale data, offering an unprecedented opportunity to model cultural commonsense at scale. Yet this knowledge remains mostly implicit and unstructured, limiting its interpretability and use. We present an iterative, prompt-based framework for constructing a Cultural Commonsense Knowledge Graph (CCKG) that treats LLMs as cultural archives, systematically eliciting culture-specific entities, relations, and practices and composing them into multi-step inferential chains across languages. We evaluate CCKG on five countries with human judgments of cultural relevance, correctness, and path coherence. We find that the cultural knowledge graphs are better realized in English, even when the target culture is non-English (e.g., Chinese, Indonesian, Arabic), indicating uneven cultural encoding in current LLMs. Augmenting smaller LLMs with CCKG improves performance on cultural reasoning and story generation, with the largest gains from English chains. Our results show both the promise and limits of LLMs as cultural technologies and that chain-structured cultural knowledge is a practical substrate for culturally grounded NLP.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17971v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Photovoltaic energy sharing: Implementation and tests on a real collective self-consumption system</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17974</link><description>arXiv:2601.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research study analyses different types of photovoltaic (PV) energy sharing in a collective self-consumption (CSC) real-case in the Izarbel technological park in France. The analysis is carried out above all from the point of view of the self-consumption rate (SCR) and the savings. After explaining the emergence of the self-consumption concept for the integration of renewable energies, the study case is described. The PV energy is produced in ESTIA1 building and consumed in ESTIA1, 2 and 4 buildings. The main IoT components used to implement the CSC are smart meters and the Tecsol TICs; devices based on the LoRa protocol to retrieve production and consumption data. Then, the characteristics of PV energy sharing in France are explained, in particular the three possible types of energy sharing/allocation (static, dynamic by default and customised dynamic) and the structure of the electricity bill. Finally, the three types of sharing are compared in four scenarios (without and with a data centre, for low and high solar radiation). The results show that the dynamic allocations lead to increases of the SCR and that the customised dynamic sharing increases savings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17974v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gradual Generation of User Interfaces as a Design Method for Malleable Software</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17975</link><description>arXiv:2601.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI is growing increasingly capable of automatically generating user interfaces (GenUI) from user prompts. However, designing GenUI applications that enable users to discover diverse customizations while preserving GenUI's expressiveness remains challenging. Current design methods -- presenting prompt boxes and leveraging context -- lack affordances for customization discovery, while traditional menu-based approaches become overly complex given GenUI's vast customization space. We propose Gradually Generating User Interfaces -- a design method that structures customizations into intermediate UI layers that AI gradually loads during interface generation. These intermediate stages expose different customization features along specific dimensions, making them discoverable to users. Users can wind back the generation process to access customizations. We demonstrate this approach through three prototype websites, showing how designers can support GenUI's expanded customization capabilities while maintaining visual simplicity and discoverability. Our work offers a practical method for integrating customization features into GenUI applications, contributing an approach to designing malleable software.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17975v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-driven nonparametric Li-ion battery ageing model aiming at learning from real operation data -- Part A: Storage operation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17978</link><description>arXiv:2601.17978v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a powerful tool in modern numerical linear algebra, which underpins computational methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), low-rank approximations, and randomized algorithms. Many practical scenarios require solving numerous small SVD problems, a regime generally referred to as "batch SVD". Existing programming models can handle this efficiently on parallel CPU architectures, but high-performance solutions for GPUs remain immature. A GPU-oriented batch SVD solver is introduced. This solver exploits the one-sided Jacobi algorithm to exploit fine-grained parallelism, and a number of algorithmic and design optimizations achieve unmatched performance. Starting from a baseline solver, a sequence of optimizations is applied to obtain incremental performance gains. Numerical experiments show that the new solver is robust across problems with different numerical properties, matrix shapes, and arithmetic precisions. Performance benchmarks on both NVIDIA and AMD systems show significant performance speedups over vendor solutions as well as existing open-source solvers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17979v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SD-E$^2$: Semantic Exploration for Reasoning Under Token Budgets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17982</link><description>arXiv:2601.17982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) struggle with complex reasoning because exploration is expensive under tight compute budgets. We introduce Semantic Diversity-Exploration-Exploitation (SD-E$^2$), a reinforcement learning framework that makes exploration explicit by optimizing semantic diversity in generated reasoning trajectories. Using a frozen sentence-embedding model, SD-E$^2$ assigns a diversity reward that captures (i) the coverage of semantically distinct solution strategies and (ii) their average pairwise dissimilarity in embedding space, rather than surface-form novelty. This diversity reward is combined with outcome correctness and solution efficiency in a z-score-normalized multi-objective objective that stabilizes training. On GSM8K, SD-E$^2$ surpasses the base Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and strong GRPO baselines (GRPO-CFL and GRPO-CFEE) by +27.4, +5.2, and +1.5 percentage points, respectively, while discovering on average 9.8 semantically distinct strategies per question. We further improve MedMCQA to 49.64% versus 38.37% for the base model and show gains on the harder AIME benchmark (1983-2025), reaching 13.28% versus 6.74% for the base. These results indicate that rewarding semantic novelty yields a more compute-efficient exploration-exploitation signal for training reasoning-capable SLMs. By introducing cognitive adaptation-adjusting the reasoning process structure rather than per-token computation-SD-E$^2$ offers a complementary path to efficiency gains in resource-constrained models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17982v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-driven nonparametric Li-ion battery ageing model aiming at learning from real operation data -- Part B: Cycling operation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17983</link><description>arXiv:2601.17983v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Training of multimodal foundation models is currently restricted to centralized data centers containing massive, aligned datasets (e.g., image-text pairs). However, in realistic federated environments, data is often unpaired and fragmented across disjoint nodes; one node may hold sensor data, while another holds textual logs. These datasets are strictly private and share no common samples. Current federated learning (FL) methods fail in this regime, as they assume local clients possess aligned pairs or require sharing raw feature embeddings, which violates data sovereignty. We propose a novel framework to train a global multimodal transformer across decentralized nodes with disjoint modalities. We introduce a small public anchor set to align disjoint private manifolds. Using Gram matrices calculated from these public anchors, we enforce semantic alignment across modalities through centered kernel alignment without ever transmitting private samples, offering a mathematically superior privacy guarantee compared to prototype sharing. Further, we introduce a subspace-stabilized fine-tuning method to handle FL with huge transformer models. We strictly decouple domain-specific magnitude shifts from semantic direction, ensuring that nodes with varying sensor characteristics align geometrically to the global consensus. Lastly, we propose precision weighted averaging, where efficiently obtained uncertainty estimates are used to downweight uncertain nodes. This paper establishes the mathematical backbone for federated unpaired foundation models, enabling a global model to learn a unified representation of the world from fragmented, disjoint, and private data silos without requiring centralized storage or paired samples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Systematic Characterization of Minimal Deep Learning Architectures: A Unified Analysis of Convergence, Pruning, and Quantization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17987</link><description>arXiv:2601.17987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning networks excel at classification, yet identifying minimal architectures that reliably solve a task remains challenging. We present a computational methodology for systematically exploring and analyzing the relationships among convergence, pruning, and quantization. The workflow first performs a structured design sweep across a large set of architectures, then evaluates convergence behavior, pruning sensitivity, and quantization robustness on representative models. Focusing on well-known image classification of increasing complexity, and across Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Vision Transformers, our initial results show that, despite architectural diversity, performance is largely invariant and learning dynamics consistently exhibit three regimes: unstable, learning, and overfitting. We further characterize the minimal learnable parameters required for stable learning, uncover distinct convergence and pruning phases, and quantify the effect of reduced numeric precision on trainable parameters. Aligning with intuition, the results confirm that deeper architectures are more resilient to pruning than shallower ones, with parameter redundancy as high as 60%, and quantization impacts models with fewer learnable parameters more severely and has a larger effect on harder image datasets. These findings provide actionable guidance for selecting compact, stable models under pruning and low-precision constraints in image classification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17987v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NeuroManip: Prosthetic Hand Manipulation System Based on EMG and Eye Tracking Powered by the Neuromorphic Processor AltAi</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17991</link><description>arXiv:2601.17991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel neuromorphic control architecture for upper-limb prostheses that combines surface electromyography (sEMG) with gaze-guided computer vision. The system uses a spiking neural network deployed on the neuromorphic processor AltAi to classify EMG patterns in real time while an eye-tracking headset and scene camera identify the object within the user's focus. In our prototype, the same EMG recognition model that was originally developed for a conventional GPU is deployed as a spiking network on AltAi, achieving comparable accuracy while operating in a sub-watt power regime, which enables a lightweight, wearable implementation. For six distinct functional gestures recorded from upper-limb amputees, the system achieves robust recognition performance comparable to state-of-the-art myoelectric interfaces. When the vision pipeline restricts the decision space to three context-appropriate gestures for the currently viewed object, recognition accuracy increases to roughly 95% while excluding unsafe, object-inappropriate grasps. These results indicate that the proposed neuromorphic, context-aware controller can provide energy-efficient and reliable prosthesis control and has the potential to improve safety and usability in everyday activities for people with upper-limb amputation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17991v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-based approach to burnout identification from textual data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17993</link><description>arXiv:2601.17993v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We explain how to construct in two different ways a cartesian closed fibration of higher-order regular languages in the sense of Salvati. In the first construction, we use fibrational techniques to derive the cartesian closed fibration from the various categories of regular languages of $\lambda$-terms associated to finite sets of ground states. In the second construction, we take advantage of the recent notion of profinite $\lambda$-calculus to define the cartesian closed fibration by a change-of-base from the fibration of clopen subsets over the category of Stone spaces, using an elegant idea coming from Hermida. We illustrate the expressive power of the cartesian closed fibration by generalizing the notion of Brzozowski derivative to higher-order regular languages, using an Isbell-like adjunction in the sense of Melli\`es and Zeilberger.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18000v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MorphXAI: An Explainable Framework for Morphological Analysis of Parasites in Blood Smear Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18001</link><description>arXiv:2601.18001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parasitic infections remain a pressing global health challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where diagnosis still depends on labor-intensive manual inspection of blood smears and the availability of expert domain knowledge. While deep learning models have shown strong performance in automating parasite detection, their clinical usefulness is constrained by limited interpretability. Existing explainability methods are largely restricted to visual heatmaps or attention maps, which highlight regions of interest but fail to capture the morphological traits that clinicians rely on for diagnosis. In this work, we present MorphXAI, an explainable framework that unifies parasite detection with fine-grained morphological analysis. MorphXAI integrates morphological supervision directly into the prediction pipeline, enabling the model to localize parasites while simultaneously characterizing clinically relevant attributes such as shape, curvature, visible dot count, flagellum presence, and developmental stage. To support this task, we curate a clinician-annotated dataset of three parasite species (Leishmania, Trypanosoma brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi) with detailed morphological labels, establishing a new benchmark for interpretable parasite analysis. Experimental results show that MorphXAI not only improves detection performance over the baseline but also provides structured, biologically meaningful explanations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Persistent Permutability in Choice Petri Nets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18004</link><description>arXiv:2601.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistence is a strong, global, behavioural property of a Petri net, meaning that no activity can disable a different activity. Persistent permutability is a weaker property, pertaining to individual interleavings of a Petri net and stating that a non-persistent sequence can be permuted into a persistent one. We identify Petri net classes for which persistent permutability already suffices to imply overall persistence. These classes generalise free-choice nets and are related to Petri's concept of ``confusion'', while they are distinguished from each other by diverse restrictions on the choice structure of a net. We prove Ochmanski's conjecture to be correct for these classes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18004v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PEAR: Pairwise Evaluation for Automatic Relative Scoring in Machine Translation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18006</link><description>arXiv:2601.18006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PEAR (Pairwise Evaluation for Automatic Relative Scoring), a supervised Quality Estimation (QE) metric family that reframes reference-free Machine Translation (MT) evaluation as a graded pairwise comparison. Given a source segment and two candidate translations, PEAR predicts the direction and magnitude of their quality difference. The metrics are trained using pairwise supervision derived from differences in human judgments, with an additional regularization term that encourages sign inversion under candidate order reversal. On the WMT24 meta-evaluation benchmark, PEAR outperforms strictly matched single-candidate QE baselines trained with the same data and backbones, isolating the benefit of the proposed pairwise formulation. Despite using substantially fewer parameters than recent large metrics, PEAR surpasses far larger QE models and reference-based metrics. Our analysis further indicates that PEAR yields a less redundant evaluation signal relative to other top metrics. Finally, we show that PEAR is an effective utility function for Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, reducing pairwise scoring cost at negligible impact.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18006v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Strip-Fusion: Spatiotemporal Fusion for Multispectral Pedestrian Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18008</link><description>arXiv:2601.18008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian detection is a critical task in robot perception. Multispectral modalities (visible light and thermal) can boost pedestrian detection performance by providing complementary visual information. Several gaps remain with multispectral pedestrian detection methods. First, existing approaches primarily focus on spatial fusion and often neglect temporal information. Second, RGB and thermal image pairs in multispectral benchmarks may not always be perfectly aligned. Pedestrians are also challenging to detect due to varying lighting conditions, occlusion, etc. This work proposes Strip-Fusion, a spatial-temporal fusion network that is robust to misalignment in input images, as well as varying lighting conditions and heavy occlusions. The Strip-Fusion pipeline integrates temporally adaptive convolutions to dynamically weigh spatial-temporal features, enabling our model to better capture pedestrian motion and context over time. A novel Kullback-Leibler divergence loss was designed to mitigate modality imbalance between visible and thermal inputs, guiding feature alignment toward the more informative modality during training. Furthermore, a novel post-processing algorithm was developed to reduce false positives. Extensive experimental results show that our method performs competitively for both the KAIST and the CVC-14 benchmarks. We also observed significant improvements compared to previous state-of-the-art on challenging conditions such as heavy occlusion and misalignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18008v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Post-Training Denoising of User Profiles with LLMs in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18009</link><description>arXiv:2601.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit feedback -- the main data source for training Recommender Systems (RSs) -- is inherently noisy and has been shown to negatively affect recommendation effectiveness. Denoising has been proposed as a method for removing noisy implicit feedback and improving recommendations. Prior work has focused on in-training denoising, however this requires additional data, changes to the model architecture and training procedure or fine-tuning, all of which can be costly and data hungry. In this work, we focus on post-training denoising. Different from in-training denoising, post-training denoising does not involve changing the architecture of the model nor its training procedure, and does not require additional data. Specifically, we present a method for post-training denoising user profiles using Large Language Models (LLMs) for Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendations. Our approach prompts LLMs with (i) a user profile (user interactions), (ii) a candidate item, and (iii) its rank as given by the CF recommender, and asks the LLM to remove items from the user profile to improve the rank of the candidate item. Experiments with a state-of-the-art CF recommender and 4 open and closed source LLMs in 3 datasets show that our denoising yields improvements up to 13% in effectiveness over the original user profiles. Our code is available at https://github.com/edervishaj/denoising-user-profiles-LLM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18009v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MultiChain Blockchain Data Provenance for Deterministic Stream Processing with Kafka Streams: A Weather Data Case Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18011</link><description>arXiv:2601.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditability and reproducibility still are critical challenges for real-time data streams pipelines. Streaming engines are highly dependent on runtime scheduling, window triggers, arrival orders, and uncertainties such as network jitters. These all derive the streaming pipeline platforms to throw non-determinist outputs. In this work, we introduce a blockchain-backed provenance architecture for streaming platform (e.g Kafka Streams) the publishes cryptographic data of a windowed data stream without publishing window payloads on-chain. We used real-time weather data from weather stations in Berlin. Weather records are canonicalized, deduplicated, and aggregated per window, then serialised deterministically. Furthermore, the Merkle root of the records within the window is computed and stored alongside with Kafka offsets boundaries to MultiChain blockchain streams as checkpoints. Our design can enable an independent auditor to verify: (1) the completeness of window payloads, (2) canonical serialization, and (3) correctness of derived analytics such as minimum/maximum/average temperatures. We evaluated our system using real data stream from two weather stations (Berlin-Brandenburg and Berlin-Tempelhof) and showed linear verification cost, deterministic reproducibility, and with a scalable off-chain storage with on-chain cryptographic anchoring. We also demonstrated that the blockchain can afford to be integrated with streaming platforms particularly with our system, and we get satisfactory transactions per second values.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18011v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Semantic and Syntactic Understanding in Large Language Models for Payroll Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18012</link><description>arXiv:2601.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are now used daily for writing, search, and analysis, and their natural language understanding continues to improve. However, they remain unreliable on exact numerical calculation and on producing outputs that are straightforward to audit. We study synthetic payroll system as a focused, high-stakes example and evaluate whether models can understand a payroll schema, apply rules in the right order, and deliver cent-accurate results.

Abstract: Reliable transformation of unstructured person and address text into structured data remains a key challenge in large-scale information systems. Traditional rule-based and probabilistic approaches perform well on clean inputs but fail under noisy or multilingual conditions, while neural and large language models (LLMs) often lack deterministic control and reproducibility. This paper introduces a prompt-driven, validation-centered framework that converts free-text records into a consistent 17-field schema without fine-tuning. The method integrates input normalisation, structured prompting, constrained decoding, and strict rule-based validation under fixed experimental settings to ensure reproducibility. Evaluations on heterogeneous real-world address data show high field-level accuracy, strong schema adherence, and stable confidence calibration. The results demonstrate that combining deterministic validation with generative prompting provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for structured information extraction, offering a practical alternative to training-heavy or domain-specific models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A theoretical and computational framework for three dimensional inverse medium scattering using the linearized low-rank structure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18016</link><description>arXiv:2601.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a theoretical and computational framework for solving the three dimensional inverse medium scattering problem, based on a set of data-driven basis arising from the linearized problem. This set of data-driven basis consists of generalizations of prolate spheroidal wave functions to three dimensions (3D PSWFs), the main ingredients to explore a low-rank approximation of the inverse solution. We first establish the fundamentals of the inverse scattering analysis, including regularity in a customized Sobolev space and new a priori estimate. This is followed by a computational framework showcasing computing the 3D PSWFs and the low-rank approximation of the inverse solution. These results rely heavily on the fact that the 3D PSWFs are eigenfunctions of both a restricted Fourier integral operator and a Sturm-Liouville differential operator. Furthermore we propose a Tikhonov regularization method with a customized penalty norm and a localized imaging technique to image a targeting object despite the possible presence of its surroundings. Finally various numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the potential of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18016v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sentipolis: Emotion-Aware Agents for Social Simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18027</link><description>arXiv:2601.18027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly used for social simulation, yet emotion is often treated as a transient cue, causing emotional amnesia and weak long-horizon continuity. We present Sentipolis, a framework for emotionally stateful agents that integrates continuous Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) representation, dual-speed emotion dynamics, and emotion--memory coupling. Across thousands of interactions over multiple base models and evaluators, Sentipolis improves emotionally grounded behavior, boosting communication, and emotional continuity. Gains are model-dependent: believability increases for higher-capacity models but can drop for smaller ones, and emotion-awareness can mildly reduce adherence to social norms, reflecting a human-like tension between emotion-driven behavior and rule compliance in social simulation. Network-level diagnostics show reciprocal, moderately clustered, and temporally stable relationship structures, supporting the study of cumulative social dynamics such as alliance formation and gradual relationship change.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18027v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spelling Bee Embeddings for Language Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18030</link><description>arXiv:2601.18030v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Dielectric materials are critical building blocks for modern electronics such as sensors, actuators, and transistors. With the rapid recent advance in soft and stretchable electronics for emerging human- and robot-interfacing applications, there is a surging need for high-performance dielectric elastomers. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop soft elastomers that simultaneously possess high dielectric constants (k, related to energy storage capacity) and low Young's moduli (E, related to mechanical flexibility). While some new elastomer designs have been reported in individual (mostly one-off) studies, almost no structured dataset is currently available for dielectric elastomers that systematically encompasses their molecular sequence, dielectric, and mechanical properties. Within this context, we curate a compact, high-quality dataset of acrylate-based dielectric elastomers, one of the most widely explored elastomer backbones due to its versatile chemistry and molecular design flexibility, by screening and aggregating experimental results from the literature over the past 10 years. Building on this dataset, we propose a multimodal learning framework that leverages large-scale pretrained polymer representations from graph- and sequence-based encoders. These pretrained embeddings transfer rich chemical and structural knowledge from vast polymer corpora, enabling accurate few-shot prediction of both dielectric and mechanical properties from molecular sequences. Our results represent a new paradigm for transferring knowledge from pretrained multimodal models to overcome severe data scarcity, which can be readily translated to other polymer backbones (e.g., silicones, urethanes) and thus accelerate data-efficient discovery of soft high-k dielectric elastomers.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools improve productivity in knowledge workflows such as writing, but also risk overreliance and reduced critical thinking. Cognitive forcing functions (CFFs) mitigate these risks by requiring active engagement with AI output. As GenAI workflows grow more complex, systems increasingly present execution plans for user review. However, these plans are themselves AI-generated and prone to overreliance, and the effectiveness of applying CFFs to AI plans remains underexplored. We conduct a controlled experiment in which participants completed AI-assisted writing tasks while reviewing AI-generated plans under four CFF conditions: Assumption (argument analysis), WhatIf (hypothesis testing), Both, and a no-CFF control. A follow-up think-aloud and interview study qualitatively compared these conditions. Results show that the Assumption CFF most effectively reduced overreliance without increasing cognitive load, while participants perceived the WhatIf CFF as most helpful. These findings highlight the value of plan-focused CFFs for supporting critical reflection in GenAI-assisted knowledge work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18033v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RGFL: Reasoning Guided Fault Localization for Automated Program Repair Using Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18044</link><description>arXiv:2601.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault Localization (FL) is a critical step in Automated Program Repair (APR), and its importance has increased with the rise of Large Language Model (LLM)-based repair agents. In realistic project-level repair scenarios, software repositories often span millions of tokens, far exceeding current LLM context limits. Consequently, models must first identify a small, relevant subset of code, making accurate FL essential for effective repair. We present a novel project-level FL approach that improves both file- and element-level localization. Our method introduces a hierarchical reasoning module that (i) generates structured, bug-specific explanations for candidate files and elements, and (ii) leverages these explanations in a two-stage ranking scheme combining LLM-based and embedding-based signals. We further propose a counterfactual upper-bound analysis to quantify the contribution of each localization stage to repair success. We evaluate our approach on Python and Java projects from SWE-bench Verified, Lite, and Java. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including Agentless and OpenHands, our method consistently improves localization accuracy. On SWE-bench Verified, file-level Hit@1 improves from 71.4% to 85%, and MRR from 81.8% to 88.8%. At the element level, Exact Match under top-3 files increases from 36% to 69%. Integrating our localization into Agentless yields a 12.8% end-to-end repair success improvement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18044v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging Persistence Image to Enhance Robustness and Performance in Curvilinear Structure Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18045</link><description>arXiv:2601.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in medical images is essential for analyzing morphological patterns in clinical applications. Integrating topological properties, such as connectivity, improves segmentation accuracy and consistency. However, extracting and embedding such properties - especially from Persistence Diagrams (PD) - is challenging due to their non-differentiability and computational cost. Existing approaches mostly encode topology through handcrafted loss functions, which generalize poorly across tasks. In this paper, we propose PIs-Regressor, a simple yet effective module that learns persistence image (PI) - finite, differentiable representations of topological features - directly from data. Together with Topology SegNet, which fuses these features in both downsampling and upsampling stages, our framework integrates topology into the network architecture itself rather than auxiliary losses. Unlike existing methods that depend heavily on handcrafted loss functions, our approach directly incorporates topological information into the network structure, leading to more robust segmentation. Our design is flexible and can be seamlessly combined with other topology-based methods to further enhance segmentation performance. Experimental results show that integrating topological features enhances model robustness, effectively handling challenges like overexposure and blurring in medical imaging. Our approach on three curvilinear benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and topological fidelity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18045v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semi-Supervised Hyperspectral Image Classification with Edge-Aware Superpixel Label Propagation and Adaptive Pseudo-Labeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18049</link><description>arXiv:2601.18049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in semi-supervised hyperspectral image (HSI) classification regarding feature extraction and classification performance. However, due to high annotation costs and limited sample availability, semi-supervised learning still faces challenges such as boundary label diffusion and pseudo-label instability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised hyperspectral classification framework integrating spatial prior information with a dynamic learning mechanism. First, we design an Edge-Aware Superpixel Label Propagation (EASLP) module. By integrating edge intensity penalty with neighborhood correction strategy, it mitigates label diffusion from superpixel segmentation while enhancing classification robustness in boundary regions. Second, we introduce a Dynamic History-Fused Prediction (DHP) method. By maintaining historical predictions and dynamically weighting them with current results, DHP smoothens pseudo-label fluctuations and improves temporal consistency and noise resistance. Concurrently, incorporating condifence and consistency measures, the Adaptive Tripartite Sample Categorization (ATSC) strategy implements hierarchical utilization of easy, ambiguous, and hard samples, leading to enhanced pseudo-label quality and learning efficiency. The Dynamic Reliability-Enhanced Pseudo-Label Framework (DREPL), composed of DHP and ATSC, strengthens pseudo-label stability across temporal and sample domains. Through synergizes operation with EASLP, it achieves spatio-temporal consistency optimization. Evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate its capability to maintain superior classification performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Addressing LLM Diversity by Infusing Random Concepts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18053</link><description>arXiv:2601.18053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to produce outputs with limited diversity. In this work, we study whether infusing random concepts in the prompts can improve the diversity of the generated outputs. To benchmark the approach, we design a systematic evaluation protocol which involves prompting an LLM with questions of the form "Name 10 Hollywood actors", and analyzing diversity measures of the resulting LLM outputs. Our experiments on multiple LLMs show that prepending random words/sentences unrelated to the prompt result in greater diversity in the outputs of LLMs. We believe that this promising result and the evaluation protocol opens up interesting avenues for future work, such as how infusing randomness into LLMs could be applied to other domains. Further, the evaluation protocol could also inspire research into benchmarking LLM diversity more systematically.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18053v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neurocomputational Mechanisms of Syntactic Transfer in Bilingual Sentence Production</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18056</link><description>arXiv:2601.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the benefits of incorporating into the study of bilingual production errors and their traditionally documented timing signatures (e.g., event-related potentials) certain types of oscillatory signatures, which can offer new implementational-level constraints for theories of bilingualism. We argue that a recent neural model of language, ROSE, can offer a neurocomputational account of syntactic transfer in bilingual production, capturing some of its formal properties and the scope of morphosyntactic sequencing failure modes. We take as a case study cross-linguistic influence (CLI) and attendant theories of functional inhibition/competition, and present these as being driven by specific oscillatory failure modes during L2 sentence planning. We argue that modeling CLI in this way not only offers the kind of linking hypothesis ROSE was built to encourage, but also licenses the exploration of more spatiotemporally complex biomarkers of language dysfunction than more commonly discussed neural signatures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18056v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Expert Evaluation and the Limits of Human Feedback in Mental Health AI Safety Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18061</link><description>arXiv:2601.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from human feedback~(LHF) assumes that expert judgments, appropriately aggregated, yield valid ground truth for training and evaluating AI systems. We tested this assumption in mental health, where high safety stakes make expert consensus essential. Three certified psychiatrists independently evaluated LLM-generated responses using a calibrated rubric. Despite similar training and shared instructions, inter-rater reliability was consistently poor ($ICC$ $0.087$--$0.295$), falling below thresholds considered acceptable for consequential assessment. Disagreement was highest on the most safety-critical items. Suicide and self-harm responses produced greater divergence than any other category, and was systematic rather than random. One factor yielded negative reliability (Krippendorff's $\alpha = -0.203$), indicating structured disagreement worse than chance. Qualitative interviews revealed that disagreement reflects coherent but incompatible individual clinical frameworks, safety-first, engagement-centered, and culturally-informed orientations, rather than measurement error. By demonstrating that experts rely on holistic risk heuristics rather than granular factor discrimination, these findings suggest that aggregated labels function as arithmetic compromises that effectively erase grounded professional philosophies. Our results characterize expert disagreement in safety-critical AI as a sociotechnical phenomenon where professional experience introduces sophisticated layers of principled divergence. We discuss implications for reward modeling, safety classification, and evaluation benchmarks, recommending that practitioners shift from consensus-based aggregation to alignment methods that preserve and learn from expert disagreement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18061v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Resonant Sparse Geometry Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18064</link><description>arXiv:2601.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Resonant Sparse Geometry Networks (RSGN), a brain-inspired architecture with self-organizing sparse
  hierarchical input-dependent connectivity. Unlike Transformer architectures that employ dense attention mechanisms with
  O(n^2) computational complexity, RSGN embeds computational nodes in learned hyperbolic space where connection strength
  decays with geodesic distance, achieving dynamic sparsity that adapts to each input. The architecture operates on two
  distinct timescales: fast differentiable activation propagation optimized through gradient descent, and slow
  Hebbian-inspired structural learning for connectivity adaptation through local correlation rules. We provide rigorous
  mathematical analysis demonstrating that RSGN achieves O(n*k) computational complexity, where k &lt;&lt; n represents the average
  active neighborhood size. Experimental evaluation on hierarchical classification and long-range dependency tasks
  demonstrates that RSGN achieves 96.5% accuracy on long-range dependency tasks while using approximately 15x fewer
  parameters than standard Transformers. On challenging hierarchical classification with 20 classes, RSGN achieves 23.8%
  accuracy (compared to 5% random baseline) with only 41,672 parameters, nearly 10x fewer than the Transformer baselines
  which require 403,348 parameters to achieve 30.1% accuracy. Our ablation studies confirm the contribution of each architectural
  component, with Hebbian learning providing consistent improvements. These results suggest that brain-inspired principles
  of sparse, geometrically-organized computation offer a promising direction toward more efficient and biologically plausible
  neural architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Grounded Concreteness: Human-Like Concreteness Sensitivity in Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18065</link><description>arXiv:2601.18065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do vision--language models (VLMs) develop more human-like sensitivity to linguistic concreteness than text-only large language models (LLMs) when both are evaluated with text-only prompts? We study this question with a controlled comparison between matched Llama text backbones and their Llama Vision counterparts across multiple model scales, treating multimodal pretraining as an ablation on perceptual grounding rather than access to images at inference. We measure concreteness effects at three complementary levels: (i) output behavior, by relating question-level concreteness to QA accuracy; (ii) embedding geometry, by testing whether representations organize along a concreteness axis; and (iii) attention dynamics, by quantifying context reliance via attention-entropy measures. In addition, we elicit token-level concreteness ratings from models and evaluate alignment to human norm distributions, testing whether multimodal training yields more human-consistent judgments. Across benchmarks and scales, VLMs show larger gains on more concrete inputs, exhibit clearer concreteness-structured representations, produce ratings that better match human norms, and display systematically different attention patterns consistent with increased grounding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18065v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EvolVE: Evolutionary Search for LLM-based Verilog Generation and Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18067</link><description>arXiv:2601.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verilog's design cycle is inherently labor-intensive and necessitates extensive domain expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising pathway toward automation, their limited training data and intrinsic sequential reasoning fail to capture the strict formal logic and concurrency inherent in hardware systems. To overcome these barriers, we present EvolVE, the first framework to analyze multiple evolution strategies on chip design tasks, revealing that Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) excels at maximizing functional correctness, while Idea-Guided Refinement (IGR) proves superior for optimization. We further leverage Structured Testbench Generation (STG) to accelerate the evolutionary process. To address the lack of complex optimization benchmarks, we introduce IC-RTL, targeting industry-scale problems derived from the National Integrated Circuit Contest. Evaluations establish EvolVE as the new state-of-the-art, achieving 98.1% on VerilogEval v2 and 92% on RTLLM v2. Furthermore, on the industry-scale IC-RTL suite, our framework surpasses reference implementations authored by contest participants, reducing the Power, Performance, Area (PPA) product by up to 66% in Huffman Coding and 17% in the geometric mean across all problems.

Abstract: Aim-assist cheats are the most prevalent and infamous form of cheating in First-Person Shooter (FPS) games, which help cheaters illegally reveal the opponent's location and auto-aim and shoot, and thereby pose significant threats to the game industry. Although a considerable research effort has been made to automatically detect aim-assist cheats, existing works suffer from unreliable frameworks, limited generalizability, high overhead, low detection performance, and a lack of explainability of detection results. In this paper, we propose XGuardian, a server-side generalized and explainable system for detecting aim-assist cheats to overcome these limitations. It requires only two raw data inputs, pitch and yaw, which are all FPS games' must-haves, to construct novel temporal features and describe aim trajectories, which are essential for distinguishing cheaters and normal players. XGuardian is evaluated with the latest mainstream FPS game CS2, and validates its generalizability with another two different games. It achieves high detection performance and low overhead compared to prior works across different games with real-world and large-scale datasets, demonstrating wide generalizability and high effectiveness. It is able to justify its predictions and thereby shorten the ban cycle. We make XGuardian as well as our datasets publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18068v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Version Age of Information Scheduling: Average and Tail-Risk-Sensitive Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18069</link><description>arXiv:2601.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring timely and semantically accurate information delivery is critical in real-time wireless systems. While Age of Information (AoI) quantifies temporal freshness, Version Age of Information (VAoI) captures semantic staleness by accounting for version evolution between transmitters and receivers. Existing VAoI scheduling approaches primarily focus on minimizing average VAoI, overlooking rare but severe staleness events that can compromise reliability under stochastic packet arrivals and unreliable channels. This paper investigates both average-oriented and tail-risk-sensitive VAoI scheduling in a multi-user status update system with long-term transmission cost constraints. We first formulate the average VAoI minimization problem as a constrained Markov decision process and introduce a deep diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic (D2SAC) algorithm. By generating actions through a diffusion-based denoising process, D2SAC enhances policy expressiveness and establishes a strong baseline for mean performance. Building on this foundation, we put forth RS-D3SAC, a risk-sensitive deep distributional diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic algorithm. RS-D3SAC integrates a diffusion-based actor with a quantile-based distributional critic, explicitly modeling the full VAoI return distribution. This enables principled tail-risk optimization via Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) while satisfying long-term transmission cost constraints. Extensive simulations show that, while D2SAC reduces average VAoI, RS-D3SAC consistently achieves substantial reductions in CVaR without sacrificing mean performance. The dominant gain in tail-risk reduction stems from the distributional critic, with the diffusion-based actor providing complementary refinement to stabilize and enrich policy decisions, highlighting their effectiveness for robust and risk-aware VAoI scheduling in multi-user wireless systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18069v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CIM-Tuner: Balancing the Compute and Storage Capacity of SRAM-CIM Accelerator via Hardware-mapping Co-exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18070</link><description>arXiv:2601.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging type of AI computing accelerator, SRAM Computing-In-Memory (CIM) accelerators feature high energy efficiency and throughput. However, various CIM designs and under-explored mapping strategies impede the full exploration of compute and storage balancing in SRAM-CIM accelerator, potentially leading to significant performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose CIM-Tuner, an automatic tool for hardware balancing and optimal mapping strategy under area constraint via hardware-mapping co-exploration. It ensures universality across various CIM designs through a matrix abstraction of CIM macros and a generalized accelerator template. For efficient mapping with different hardware configurations, it employs fine-grained two-level strategies comprising accelerator-level scheduling and macro-level tiling. Compared to prior CIM mapping, CIM-Tuner's extended strategy space achieves 1.58$\times$ higher energy efficiency and 2.11$\times$ higher throughput. Applied to SOTA CIM accelerators with identical area budget, CIM-Tuner also delivers comparable improvements.

Abstract: Cooperative reasoning under incomplete information remains challenging for both humans and multi-agent systems. The card game Hanabi embodies this challenge, requiring theory-of-mind reasoning and strategic communication. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art LLM agents in 2-5 player games and study the impact of context engineering across model scales (4B to 600B+) to understand persistent coordination failures and robustness to scaffolding: from a minimal prompt with only explicit card details (Watson setting), to scaffolding with programmatic, Bayesian-motivated deductions (Sherlock setting), to multi-turn state tracking via working memory (Mycroft setting). We show that (1) agents can maintain an internal working memory for state tracking and (2) cross-play performance between different LLMs smoothly interpolates with model strength. In the Sherlock setting, the strongest reasoning models exceed 15 points on average across player counts, yet still trail experienced humans and specialist Hanabi agents, both consistently scoring above 20. We release the first public Hanabi datasets with annotated trajectories and move utilities: (1) HanabiLogs, containing 1,520 full game logs for instruction tuning, and (2) HanabiRewards, containing 560 games with dense move-level value annotations for all candidate moves. Supervised and RL finetuning of a 4B open-weight model (Qwen3-Instruct) on our datasets improves cooperative Hanabi play by 21% and 156% respectively, bringing performance to within ~3 points of a strong proprietary reasoning model (o4-mini) and surpassing the best non-reasoning model (GPT-4.1) by 52%. The HanabiRewards RL-finetuned model further generalizes beyond Hanabi, improving performance on a cooperative group-guessing benchmark by 11%, temporal reasoning on EventQA by 6.4%, instruction-following on IFBench-800K by 1.7 Pass@10, and matching AIME 2025 mathematical reasoning Pass@10.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18077v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DRPG (Decompose, Retrieve, Plan, Generate): An Agentic Framework for Academic Rebuttal</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18081</link><description>arXiv:2601.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific research workflows, automated support for academic rebuttal, a crucial step in academic communication and peer review, remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf LLMs or simple pipelines, which struggle with long-context understanding and often fail to produce targeted and persuasive responses. In this paper, we propose DRPG, an agentic framework for automatic academic rebuttal generation that operates through four steps: Decompose reviews into atomic concerns, Retrieve relevant evidence from the paper, Plan rebuttal strategies, and Generate responses accordingly. Notably, the Planner in DRPG reaches over 98% accuracy in identifying the most feasible rebuttal direction. Experiments on data from top-tier conferences demonstrate that DRPG significantly outperforms existing rebuttal pipelines and achieves performance beyond the average human level using only an 8B model. Our analysis further demonstrates the effectiveness of the planner design and its value in providing multi-perspective and explainable suggestions. We also showed that DRPG works well in a more complex multi-round setting. These results highlight the effectiveness of DRPG and its potential to provide high-quality rebuttal content and support the scaling of academic discussions.

Abstract: Background: In medical and health professions education (HPE), AI is increasingly used to assess clinical competencies, including via virtual standardized patients. However, most evaluations rely on AI-human interrater reliability and lack a measurement framework for how cases, learners, and raters jointly shape scores. This leaves robustness uncertain and can expose learners to misguidance from unvalidated systems. We address this by using AI "simulated learners" to stress-test and psychometrically characterize assessment pipelines before human use.
  Objective: Develop an open-source AI virtual patient platform and measurement model for robust competency evaluation across cases and rating conditions.
  Methods: We built a platform with virtual patients, virtual learners with tunable ACGME-aligned competency profiles, and multiple independent AI raters scoring encounters with structured Key-Features items. Transcripts were analyzed with a Bayesian HRM-SDT model that treats ratings as decisions under uncertainty and separates learner ability, case performance, and rater behavior; parameters were estimated with MCMC.
  Results: The model recovered simulated learners' competencies, with significant correlations to the generating competencies across all ACGME domains despite a non-deterministic pipeline. It estimated case difficulty by competency and showed stable rater detection (sensitivity) and criteria (severity/leniency thresholds) across AI raters using identical models/prompts but different seeds. We also propose a staged "safety blueprint" for deploying AI tools with learners, tied to entrustment-based validation milestones.
  Conclusions: Combining a purpose-built virtual patient platform with a principled psychometric model enables robust, interpretable, generalizable competency estimates and supports validation of AI-assisted assessment prior to use with human learners.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18085v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Human Speech to Ocean Signals: Transferring Speech Large Models for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18086</link><description>arXiv:2601.18086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) plays a vital role in marine applications but remains challenging due to limited labeled data and the complexity of ocean environments. This paper explores a central question: can speech large models (SLMs), trained on massive human speech corpora, be effectively transferred to underwater acoustics? To investigate this, we propose UATR-SLM, a simple framework that reuses the speech feature pipeline, adapts the SLM as an acoustic encoder, and adds a lightweight classifier.Experiments on the DeepShip and ShipsEar benchmarks show that UATR-SLM achieves over 99% in-domain accuracy, maintains strong robustness across variable signal lengths, and reaches up to 96.67% accuracy in cross-domain evaluation. These results highlight the strong transferability of SLMs to UATR, establishing a promising paradigm for leveraging speech foundation models in underwater acoustics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18086v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Domain Transfer with Self-Supervised Spectral-Spatial Modeling for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18088</link><description>arXiv:2601.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has demonstrated considerable potential in hyperspectral representation, yet its application in cross-domain transfer scenarios remains under-explored. Existing methods, however, still rely on source domain annotations and are susceptible to distribution shifts, leading to degraded generalization performance in the target domain. To address this, this paper proposes a self-supervised cross-domain transfer framework that learns transferable spectral-spatial joint representations without source labels and achieves efficient adaptation under few samples in the target domain. During the self-supervised pre-training phase, a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (S2Former) module is designed. It adopts a dual-branch spatial-spectral transformer and introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to achieve spectral-spatial collaborative modeling: the spatial branch enhances structural awareness through random masking, while the spectral branch captures fine-grained differences. Both branches mutually guide each other to improve semantic consistency. We further propose a Frequency Domain Constraint (FDC) to maintain frequency-domain consistency through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT) and high-frequency magnitude loss, thereby enhancing the model's capability to discern fine details and boundaries. During the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a Diffusion-Aligned Fine-tuning (DAFT) distillation mechanism. This aligns semantic evolution trajectories through a teacher-student structure, enabling robust transfer learning under low-label conditions. Experimental results demonstrate stable classification performance and strong cross-domain adaptability across four hyperspectral datasets, validating the method's effectiveness under resource-constrained conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18088v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LatentMoE: Toward Optimal Accuracy per FLOP and Parameter in Mixture of Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18089</link><description>arXiv:2601.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoEs) have become a central component of many state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary large language models. Despite their widespread adoption, it remains unclear how close existing MoE architectures are to optimal with respect to inference cost, as measured by accuracy per floating-point operation and per parameter. In this work, we revisit MoE design from a hardware-software co-design perspective, grounded in empirical and theoretical considerations. We characterize key performance bottlenecks across diverse deployment regimes, spanning offline high-throughput execution and online, latency-critical inference. Guided by these insights, we introduce LatentMoE, a new model architecture resulting from systematic design exploration and optimized for maximal accuracy per unit of compute. Empirical design space exploration at scales of up to 95B parameters and over a 1T-token training horizon, together with supporting theoretical analysis, shows that LatentMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE architectures in terms of accuracy per FLOP and per parameter. Given its strong performance, the LatentMoE architecture has been adopted by the flagship Nemotron-3 Super and Ultra models and scaled to substantially larger regimes, including longer token horizons and larger model sizes, as reported in Nvidia et al. (arXiv:2512.20856).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18089v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From LLMs to LRMs: Rethinking Pruning for Reasoning-Centric Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18091</link><description>arXiv:2601.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly costly to deploy, motivating extensive research on model pruning. However, most existing studies focus on instruction-following LLMs, leaving it unclear whether established pruning strategies transfer to reasoning-augmented models that explicitly generate long intermediate reasoning traces. In this work, we conduct a controlled study of pruning for both instruction-following ($\textbf{LLM-instruct}$) and reasoning-augmented ($\textbf{LLM-think}$) models. To isolate the effects of pruning, we align pruning calibration and post-pruning recovery data with each model's original training distribution, which we show yields more stable and reliable pruning behavior. We evaluate static depth pruning, static width pruning, and dynamic pruning across 17 tasks spanning classification, generation, and reasoning. Our results reveal clear paradigm-dependent differences: depth pruning outperforms width pruning on classification tasks, while width pruning is more robust for generation and reasoning. Moreover, static pruning better preserves reasoning performance, whereas dynamic pruning excels on classification and generation but remains challenging for long-chain reasoning. These findings underscore the need for pruning strategies that explicitly account for the distinct characteristics of reasoning-augmented LLMs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LRM-Pruning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Struggle to Success: Context-Aware Guidance for Screen Reader Users in Computer Use</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18092</link><description>arXiv:2601.18092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equal access to digital technologies is critical for education, employment, and social participation. However, mainstream interfaces are visually oriented, creating steep learning curves and frequent obstacles for screen reader users, and limiting their independence and opportunities. Existing support is inadequate -- tutorials mainly target sighted users, while human assistance lacks real-time availability. We introduce AskEase, an on-demand AI assistant that provides step-by-step, screen reader user-friendly guidance for computer use. AskEase manages multiple sources of context to infer user intent and deliver precise, situation-specific guidance. Its seamless interaction design minimizes disruption and reduces the effort of seeking help. We demonstrated its effectiveness through representative usage scenarios and robustness tests. In a within-subjects study with 12 screen reader users, AskEase significantly improved task success while reducing perceived workload, including physical demand, effort, and frustration. These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-powered assistants to promote accessible computing and expand opportunities for users with visual impairments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18092v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing LLM-based Recommendation with Preference Hint Discovery from Knowledge Graph</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18096</link><description>arXiv:2601.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have garnered substantial attention in recommendation systems. Yet they fall short of traditional recommenders when capturing complex preference patterns. Recent works have tried integrating traditional recommendation embeddings into LLMs to resolve this issue, yet a core gap persists between their continuous embedding and discrete semantic spaces. Intuitively, textual attributes derived from interactions can serve as critical preference rationales for LLMs' recommendation logic. However, directly inputting such attribute knowledge presents two core challenges: (1) Deficiency of sparse interactions in reflecting preference hints for unseen items; (2) Substantial noise introduction from treating all attributes as hints. To this end, we propose a preference hint discovery model based on the interaction-integrated knowledge graph, enhancing LLM-based recommendation. It utilizes traditional recommendation principles to selectively extract crucial attributes as hints. Specifically, we design a collaborative preference hint extraction schema, which utilizes semantic knowledge from similar users' explicit interactions as hints for unseen items. Furthermore, we develop an instance-wise dual-attention mechanism to quantify the preference credibility of candidate attributes, identifying hints specific to each unseen item. Using these item- and user-based hints, we adopt a flattened hint organization method to shorten input length and feed the textual hint information to the LLM for commonsense reasoning. Extensive experiments on both pair-wise and list-wise recommendation tasks verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework, indicating an average relative improvement of over 3.02% against baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18096v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tail-Latency-Aware Federated Learning with Pinching Antenna: Latency, Participation, and Placement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18097</link><description>arXiv:2601.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Straggler synchronization is a dominant wall-clock bottleneck in synchronous wireless federated learning (FL). Under non-IID data, however, aggressively sampling only fast clients may significantly slow convergence due to statistical heterogeneity. This paper studies PASS-enabled FL, where a radiating pinching antenna (PA) can be activated at an arbitrary position along a dielectric waveguide to reshape uplink latencies. We consider a joint optimization of PA placement and client participation to minimize the expected time-to-accuracy, coupling the exact expected maximum round latency via order statistics with a heterogeneity-aware convergence factor. We derive first-order optimality conditions that reveal an explicit tail-latency premium in the KKT recursion, quantifying how latency gaps are amplified by maximum-order-statistic synchronization. Under a latency-class structure, we obtain a within-class square-root sampling law and establish a two-class phase transition where slow-class participation collapses under an explicit heterogeneity-threshold condition as the per-round sample size grows. For PA placement, we prove a piecewise envelope-derivative characterization and provide an exact breakpoint-and-root candidate-enumeration procedure. Simulation results verify the theoretical findings and show that PASS enables more eligible participation, yielding higher wall-clock accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18097v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Text-Pass Filter: An Efficient Scene Text Detector</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18098</link><description>arXiv:2601.18098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To pursue an efficient text assembling process, existing methods detect texts via the shrink-mask expansion strategy. However, the shrinking operation loses the visual features of text margins and confuses the foreground and background difference, which brings intrinsic limitations to recognize text features. We follow this issue and design Text-Pass Filter (TPF) for arbitrary-shaped text detection. It segments the whole text directly, which avoids the intrinsic limitations. It is noteworthy that different from previous whole text region-based methods, TPF can separate adhesive texts naturally without complex decoding or post-processing processes, which makes it possible for real-time text detection. Concretely, we find that the band-pass filter allows through components in a specified band of frequencies, called its passband but blocks components with frequencies above or below this band. It provides a natural idea for extracting whole texts separately. By simulating the band-pass filter, TPF constructs a unique feature-filter pair for each text. In the inference stage, every filter extracts the corresponding matched text by passing its pass-feature and blocking other features. Meanwhile, considering the large aspect ratio problem of ribbon-like texts makes it hard to recognize texts wholly, a Reinforcement Ensemble Unit (REU) is designed to enhance the feature consistency of the same text and to enlarge the filter's recognition field to help recognize whole texts. Furthermore, a Foreground Prior Unit (FPU) is introduced to encourage TPF to discriminate the difference between the foreground and background, which improves the feature-filter pair quality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of REU and FPU while showing the TPF's superiority.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18098v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spatial-Conditioned Reasoning in Long-Egocentric Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18100</link><description>arXiv:2601.18100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon egocentric video presents significant challenges for visual navigation due to viewpoint drift and the absence of persistent geometric context. Although recent vision-language models perform well on image and short-video reasoning, their spatial reasoning capability in long egocentric sequences remains limited. In this work, we study how explicit spatial signals influence VLM-based video understanding without modifying model architectures or inference procedures. We introduce Sanpo-D, a fine-grained re-annotation of the Google Sanpo dataset, and benchmark multiple VLMs on navigation-oriented spatial queries. To examine input-level inductive bias, we further fuse depth maps with RGB frames and evaluate their impact on spatial reasoning. Our results reveal a trade-off between general-purpose accuracy and spatial specialization, showing that depth-aware and spatially grounded representations can improve performance on safety-critical tasks such as pedestrian and obstruction detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18100v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CHiRPE: A Step Towards Real-World Clinical NLP with Clinician-Oriented Model Explanations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18102</link><description>arXiv:2601.18102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The medical adoption of NLP tools requires interpretability by end users, yet traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods are misaligned with clinical reasoning and lack clinician input. We introduce CHiRPE (Clinical High-Risk Prediction with Explainability), an NLP pipeline that takes transcribed semi-structured clinical interviews to: (i) predict psychosis risk; and (ii) generate novel SHAP explanation formats co-developed with clinicians. Trained on 944 semi-structured interview transcripts across 24 international clinics of the AMP-SCZ study, the CHiRPE pipeline integrates symptom-domain mapping, LLM summarisation, and BERT classification. CHiRPE achieved over 90% accuracy across three BERT variants and outperformed baseline models. Explanation formats were evaluated by 28 clinical experts who indicated a strong preference for our novel concept-guided explanations, especially hybrid graph-and-text summary formats. CHiRPE demonstrates that clinically-guided model development produces both accurate and interpretable results. Our next step is focused on real-world testing across our 24 international sites.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18102v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating the OWASP Top 10 For Large Language Models Applications using Intelligent Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18105</link><description>arXiv:2601.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative and disruptive technology, enabling a wide range of applications in natural language processing, machine translation, and beyond. However, this widespread integration of LLMs also raised several security concerns highlighted by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), which has identified the top 10 security vulnerabilities inherent in LLM applications. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial, given the increasing reliance on LLMs and the potential threats to data integrity, confidentiality, and service availability. This paper presents a framework designed to mitigate the security risks outlined in the OWASP Top 10. Our proposed model leverages LLM-enabled intelligent agents, offering a new approach to proactively identify, assess, and counteract security threats in real-time. The proposed framework serves as an initial blueprint for future research and development, aiming to enhance the security measures of LLMs and protect against emerging threats in this rapidly evolving landscape.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18105v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GLEN-Bench: A Graph-Language based Benchmark for Nutritional Health</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18106</link><description>arXiv:2601.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nutritional interventions are important for managing chronic health conditions, but current computational methods provide limited support for personalized dietary guidance. We identify three key gaps: (1) dietary pattern studies often ignore real-world constraints such as socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and limited food access; (2) recommendation systems rarely explain why a particular food helps a given patient; and (3) no unified benchmark evaluates methods across the connected tasks needed for nutritional interventions. We introduce GLEN-Bench, the first comprehensive graph-language based benchmark for nutritional health assessment. We combine NHANES health records, FNDDS food composition data, and USDA food-access metrics to build a knowledge graph that links demographics, health conditions, dietary behaviors, poverty-related constraints, and nutrient needs. We test the benchmark using opioid use disorder, where models must detect subtle nutritional differences across disease stages. GLEN-Bench includes three linked tasks: risk detection identifies at-risk individuals from dietary and socioeconomic patterns; recommendation suggests personalized foods that meet clinical needs within resource constraints; and question answering provides graph-grounded, natural-language explanations to facilitate comprehension. We evaluate these graph-language approaches, including graph neural networks, large language models, and hybrid architectures, to establish solid baselines and identify practical design choices. Our analysis identifies clear dietary patterns linked to health risks, providing insights that can guide practical interventions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18106v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Static Datasets: Robust Offline Policy Optimization via Vetted Synthetic Transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18107</link><description>arXiv:2601.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) holds immense promise for safety-critical domains like industrial robotics, where real-time environmental interaction is often prohibitive. A primary obstacle in ORL remains the distributional shift between the static dataset and the learned policy, which typically mandates high degrees of conservatism that can restrain potential policy improvements. We present MoReBRAC, a model-based framework that addresses this limitation through Uncertainty-Aware latent synthesis. Instead of relying solely on the fixed data, MoReBRAC utilizes a dual-recurrent world model to synthesize high-fidelity transitions that augment the training manifold. To ensure the reliability of this synthetic data, we implement a hierarchical uncertainty pipeline integrating Variational Autoencoder (VAE) manifold detection, model sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. This multi-layered filtering process guarantees that only transitions residing within high-confidence regions of the learned dynamics are utilized. Our results on D4RL Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks reveal significant performance gains, particularly in ``random'' and ``suboptimal'' data regimes. We further provide insights into the role of the VAE as a geometric anchor and discuss the distributional trade-offs encountered when learning from near-optimal datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18107v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AttenMIA: LLM Membership Inference Attack through Attention Signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18110</link><description>arXiv:2601.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to enable or improve a multitude of real-world applications. Given the large size of their training data sets, their tendency to memorize training data raises serious privacy and intellectual property concerns. A key threat is the membership inference attack (MIA), which aims to determine whether a given sample was included in the model's training set. Existing MIAs for LLMs rely primarily on output confidence scores or embedding-based features, but these signals are often brittle, leading to limited attack success. We introduce AttenMIA, a new MIA framework that exploits self-attention patterns inside the transformer model to infer membership. Attention controls the information flow within the transformer, exposing different patterns for memorization that can be used to identify members of the dataset. Our method uses information from attention heads across layers and combines them with perturbation-based divergence metrics to train an effective MIA classifier. Using extensive experiments on open-source models including LLaMA-2, Pythia, and Opt models, we show that attention-based features consistently outperform baselines, particularly under the important low-false-positive metric (e.g., achieving up to 0.996 ROC AUC &amp; 87.9% TPR@1%FPR on the WikiMIA-32 benchmark with Llama2-13b). We show that attention signals generalize across datasets and architectures, and provide a layer- and head-level analysis of where membership leakage is most pronounced. We also show that using AttenMIA to replace other membership inference attacks in a data extraction framework results in training data extraction attacks that outperform the state of the art. Our findings reveal that attention mechanisms, originally introduced to enhance interpretability, can inadvertently amplify privacy risks in LLMs, underscoring the need for new defenses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18110v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Demystifying Data-Driven Probabilistic Medium-Range Weather Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18111</link><description>arXiv:2601.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent revolution in data-driven methods for weather forecasting has lead to a fragmented landscape of complex, bespoke architectures and training strategies, obscuring the fundamental drivers of forecast accuracy. Here, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art probabilistic skill requires neither intricate architectural constraints nor specialized training heuristics. We introduce a scalable framework for learning multi-scale atmospheric dynamics by combining a directly downsampled latent space with a history-conditioned local projector that resolves high-resolution physics. We find that our framework design is robust to the choice of probabilistic estimator, seamlessly supporting stochastic interpolants, diffusion models, and CRPS-based ensemble training. Validated against the Integrated Forecasting System and the deep learning probabilistic model GenCast, our framework achieves statistically significant improvements on most of the variables. These results suggest scaling a general-purpose model is sufficient for state-of-the-art medium-range prediction, eliminating the need for tailored training recipes and proving effective across the full spectrum of probabilistic frameworks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18111v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MalURLBench: A Benchmark Evaluating Agents' Vulnerabilities When Processing Web URLs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18113</link><description>arXiv:2601.18113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based web agents have become increasingly popular for their utility in daily life and work. However, they exhibit critical vulnerabilities when processing malicious URLs: accepting a disguised malicious URL enables subsequent access to unsafe webpages, which can cause severe damage to service providers and users. Despite this risk, no benchmark currently targets this emerging threat. To address this gap, we propose MalURLBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' vulnerabilities to malicious URLs. MalURLBench contains 61,845 attack instances spanning 10 real-world scenarios and 7 categories of real malicious websites. Experiments with 12 popular LLMs reveal that existing models struggle to detect elaborately disguised malicious URLs. We further identify and analyze key factors that impact attack success rates and propose URLGuard, a lightweight defense module. We believe this work will provide a foundational resource for advancing the security of web agents.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a single neuron under standard squared loss in the presence of arbitrary label noise and group-level distributional shifts, for a broad family of covariate distributions. Our goal is to identify a ''best-fit'' neuron parameterized by $\mathbf{w}_*$ that performs well under the most challenging reweighting of the groups. Specifically, we address a Group Distributionally Robust Optimization problem: given sample access to $K$ distinct distributions $\mathcal p_{[1]},\dots,\mathcal p_{[K]}$, we seek to approximate $\mathbf{w}_*$ that minimizes the worst-case objective over convex combinations of group distributions $\boldsymbol{\lambda} \in \Delta_K$, where the objective is $\sum_{i \in [K]}\lambda_{[i]}\,\mathbb E_{(\mathbf x,y)\sim\mathcal p_{[i]}}(\sigma(\mathbf w\cdot\mathbf x)-y)^2 - \nu d_f(\boldsymbol\lambda,\frac{1}{K}\mathbf1)$ and $d_f$ is an $f$-divergence that imposes (optional) penalty on deviations from uniform group weights, scaled by a parameter $\nu \geq 0$. We develop a computationally efficient primal-dual algorithm that outputs a vector $\widehat{\mathbf w}$ that is constant-factor competitive with $\mathbf{w}_*$ under the worst-case group weighting. Our analytical framework directly confronts the inherent nonconvexity of the loss function, providing robust learning guarantees in the face of arbitrary label corruptions and group-specific distributional shifts. The implementation of the dual extrapolation update motivated by our algorithmic framework shows promise on LLM pre-training benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18115v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FABLE: Forest-Based Adaptive Bi-Path LLM-Enhanced Retrieval for Multi-Document Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18116</link><description>arXiv:2601.18116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) has reignited debate on whether Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remains necessary. However, empirical evidence reveals persistent limitations of long-context inference, including the lost-in-the-middle phenomenon, high computational cost, and poor scalability for multi-document reasoning. Conversely, traditional RAG systems, while efficient, are constrained by flat chunk-level retrieval that introduces semantic noise and fails to support structured cross-document synthesis.

FABLE constructs LLM-enhanced hierarchical forest indexes with multi-granularity semantic structures, then employs a bi-path strategy combining LLM-guided hierarchical traversal with structure-aware propagation for fine-grained evidence acquisition, with explicit budget control for adaptive efficiency trade-offs.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that FABLE consistently outperforms SOTA RAG methods and achieves comparable accuracy to full-context LLM inference with up to 94\% token reduction, showing that long-context LLMs amplify rather than fully replace the need for structured retrieval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18116v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decentralized Multi-product Pricing: Diagonal Dominance, Nash Equilibrium, and Price of Anarchy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18117</link><description>arXiv:2601.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized decision making in multi--product firms can lead to efficiency losses when autonomous decision makers fail to internalize cross--product demand interactions. This paper quantifies the magnitude of such losses by analyzing the Price of Anarchy in a pricing game in which each decision maker independently sets prices to maximize its own product--level revenue. We model demand using a linear system that captures both substitution and complementarity effects across products. We first establish existence and uniqueness of a pure--strategy Nash equilibrium under economically standard diagonal dominance conditions. Our main contribution is the derivation of a tight worst--case lower bound on the ratio between decentralized revenue and the optimal centralized revenue. We show that this efficiency loss is governed by a single scalar parameter, denoted by $\mu$, which measures the aggregate strength of cross--price effects relative to own--price sensitivities. In particular, we prove that the revenue ratio is bounded below by $4(1-\mu)/(2-\mu)^2$, and we demonstrate the tightness of this bound by constructing a symmetric market topology in which the bound is exactly attained. We further refine the analysis by providing an instance--exact characterization of efficiency loss based on the spectral properties of the demand interaction matrix. Together, these results offer a quantitative framework for assessing the trade--off between centralized pricing and decentralized autonomy in multi--product firms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18117v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LungCRCT: Causal Representation based Lung CT Processing for Lung Cancer Treatment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18118</link><description>arXiv:2601.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to silence in early stages, lung cancer has been one of the most leading causes of mortality in cancer patients world-wide. Moreover, major symptoms of lung cancer are hard to differentiate with other respiratory disease symptoms such as COPD, further leading patients to overlook cancer progression in early stages. Thus, to enhance survival rates in lung cancer, early detection from consistent proactive respiratory system monitoring becomes crucial. One of the most prevalent and effective methods for lung cancer monitoring would be low-dose computed tomography(LDCT) chest scans, which led to remarkable enhancements in lung cancer detection or tumor classification tasks under rapid advancements and applications of computer vision based AI models such as EfficientNet or ResNet in image processing. However, though advanced CNN models under transfer learning or ViT based models led to high performing lung cancer detections, due to its intrinsic limitations in terms of correlation dependence and low interpretability due to complexity, expansions of deep learning models to lung cancer treatment analysis or causal intervention analysis simulations are still limited. Therefore, this research introduced LungCRCT: a latent causal representation learning based lung cancer analysis framework that retrieves causal representations of factors within the physical causal mechanism of lung cancer progression. With the use of advanced graph autoencoder based causal discovery algorithms with distance Correlation disentanglement and entropy-based image reconstruction refinement, LungCRCT not only enables causal intervention analysis for lung cancer treatments, but also leads to robust, yet extremely light downstream models in malignant tumor classification tasks with an AUC score of 93.91%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18118v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Text-to-SQL: Can LLMs Really Debug Enterprise ETL SQL?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18119</link><description>arXiv:2601.18119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SQL is central to enterprise data engineering, yet generating fully correct SQL code in a single attempt remains difficult, even for experienced developers and advanced text-to-SQL LLMs, often requiring multiple debugging iterations. We introduce OurBench, the first benchmark for enterprise-level SQL reasoning and debugging. Our benchmark is built on two key innovations: (1) an automated construction workflow that uses reverse engineering to systematically inject realistic bugs into large-scale SQL code, enabling scalable and diverse benchmark generation; and (2) an execution-free evaluation framework tailored to enterprise settings, providing fast, accurate, and resource-efficient assessment.
  OurBench comprises 469 OurBenchSyn queries featuring syntax errors with explicit error messages, and 516 OurBenchSem queries targeting semantic errors in which the code fails to meet user intent. The queries are highly complex, averaging over 140 lines and featuring deep and wide abstract syntax trees.
  Evaluation of nearly 30 LLMs reveals a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model, Claude-4-Sonnet, achieves only 36.46 percent accuracy on OurBenchSyn and 32.17 percent on OurBenchSem, while most models score below 20 percent. We further explore four solution strategies, identify key challenges, and outline promising directions for enterprise SQL debugging with LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18119v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Generalized Weak Galerkin Method for Linear Elasticity with Nonpolynomial Approximations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18120</link><description>arXiv:2601.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a generalized weak Galerkin (gWG) finite element method for linear elasticity problems on general polygonal and polyhedral meshes. The proposed framework is flexible and efficient, allowing for the use of nonpolynomial approximating functions. The generalized weak differential operators are defined as an element-level correction of the classical differential operators accounting for boundary discontinuities. This construction reduces computational cost and provides greater flexibility than standard weak Galerkin formulations. The gWG framework naturally accommodates arbitrary finite-dimensional approximation spaces, including nonpolynomial activation-based spaces with randomly selected parameters. Error equations and error estimates are established for the proposed method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method is locking-free, robust with respect to mesh geometry, and effective on general polygonal and polyhedral partitions. In particular, activation-based interior approximation spaces exhibit convergence behavior comparable to that of classical polynomial spaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18120v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Grasp-and-Lift: Executable 3D Hand-Object Interaction Reconstruction via Physics-in-the-Loop Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18121</link><description>arXiv:2601.18121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous hand manipulation increasingly relies on large-scale motion datasets with precise hand-object trajectory data. However, existing resources such as DexYCB and HO3D are primarily optimized for visual alignment but often yield physically implausible interactions when replayed in physics simulators, including penetration, missed contact, and unstable grasps.
  We propose a simulation-in-the-loop refinement framework that converts these visually aligned trajectories into physically executable ones. Our core contribution is to formulate this as a tractable black-box optimization problem. We parameterize the hand's motion using a low-dimensional, spline-based representation built on sparse temporal keyframes. This allows us to use a powerful gradient-free optimizer, CMA-ES, to treat the high-fidelity physics engine as a black-box objective function. Our method finds motions that simultaneously maximize physical success (e.g., stable grasp and lift) while minimizing deviation from the original human demonstration.
  Compared to MANIPTRANS-recent transfer pipelines, our approach achieves lower hand and object pose errors during replay and more accurately recovers hand-object physical interactions. Our approach provides a general and scalable method for converting visual demonstrations into physically valid trajectories, enabling the generation of high-fidelity data crucial for robust policy learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18121v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deadline-Aware, Energy-Efficient Control of Domestic Immersion Hot Water Heaters</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18123</link><description>arXiv:2601.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical domestic immersion water heater systems are often operated continuously during winter, heating quickly rather than efficiently and ignoring predictable demand windows and ambient losses. We study deadline-aware control, where the aim is to reach a target temperature at a specified time while minimising energy consumption. We introduce an efficient Gymnasium environment that models an immersion hot water heater with first-order thermal losses and discrete on and off actions of 0 W and 6000 W applied every 120 seconds. Methods include a time-optimal bang-bang baseline, a zero-shot Monte Carlo Tree Search planner, and a Proximal Policy Optimisation policy. We report total energy consumption in watt-hours under identical physical dynamics. Across sweeps of initial temperature from 10 to 30 degrees Celsius, deadline from 30 to 90 steps, and target temperature from 40 to 80 degrees Celsius, PPO achieves the most energy-efficient performance at a 60-step horizon of 2 hours, using 3.23 kilowatt-hours, compared to 4.37 to 10.45 kilowatt-hours for bang-bang control and 4.18 to 6.46 kilowatt-hours for MCTS. This corresponds to energy savings of 26 percent at 30 steps and 69 percent at 90 steps. In a representative trajectory with a 50 kg water mass, 20 degrees Celsius ambient temperature, and a 60 degrees Celsius target, PPO consumes 54 percent less energy than bang-bang control and 33 percent less than MCTS. These results show that learned deadline-aware control reduces energy consumption under identical physical assumptions, while planners provide partial savings without training and learned policies offer near-zero inference cost once trained.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18123v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Users' Privacy Reasoning and Behaviors During Chatbot Use to Support Meaningful Agency in Privacy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18125</link><description>arXiv:2601.18125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational agents (CAs) (e.g., chatbots) are increasingly used in settings where users disclose sensitive information, raising significant privacy concerns. Because privacy judgments are highly contextual, supporting users to engage in privacy-protective actions during chatbot interactions is essential. However, enabling meaningful engagement requires a deeper understanding of how users currently reason about and manage sensitive information during realistic chatbot use scenarios. To investigate this, we qualitatively examined computer science (undergraduate and masters) students' in-the-moment disclosure and protection behaviors, as well as the reasoning underlying these behaviors, across a range of realistic chatbot tasks. Participants used a simulated ChatGPT interface with and without a privacy notice panel that intercepts message submissions, highlights potentially sensitive information, and offers privacy protective actions. The panel supports anonymization through retracting, faking, and generalizing, and surfaces two of ChatGPT's built-in privacy controls to improve their discoverability. Drawing on interaction logs, think-alouds, and survey responses, we analyzed how the panel fostered privacy awareness, encouraged protective actions, and supported context-specific reasoning about what information to protect and how. We further discuss design opportunities for tools that provide users greater and more meaningful agency in protecting sensitive information during CA interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18125v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Typhoon-S: Minimal Open Post-Training for Sovereign Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18129</link><description>arXiv:2601.18129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have progressed rapidly; however, most state-of-the-art models are trained and evaluated primarily in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, and are often developed by a small number of organizations with access to large-scale compute and data. This gatekeeping creates a practical barrier for sovereign settings in which a regional- or national-scale institution or domain owner must retain control and understanding of model weights, training data, and deployment while operating under limited resources and strict transparency constraints. To this end, we identify two core requirements: (1) adoptability, the ability to transform a base model into a general-purpose assistant, and (2) sovereign capability, the ability to perform high-stakes, region-specific tasks (e.g., legal reasoning in local languages and cultural knowledge). We investigate whether these requirements can be achieved without scaling massive instruction corpora or relying on complex preference tuning pipelines and large-scale reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We present Typhoon S, a minimal and open post-training recipe that combines supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and small-scale RFT. Using Thai as a representative case study, we demonstrate that our approach transforms both sovereign-adapted and general-purpose base models into instruction-tuned models with strong general performance. We further show that small-scale RFT with InK-GRPO -- an extension of GRPO that augments the GRPO loss with a next-word prediction loss -- improves Thai legal reasoning and Thai-specific knowledge while preserving general capabilities. Our results suggest that a carefully designed post-training strategy can reduce the required scale of instruction data and computation, providing a practical path toward high-quality sovereign LLMs under academic-scale resources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18129v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RouteMoA: Dynamic Routing without Pre-Inference Boosts Efficient Mixture-of-Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18130</link><description>arXiv:2601.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) improves LLM performance through layered collaboration, but its dense topology raises costs and latency. Existing methods employ LLM judges to filter responses, yet still require all models to perform inference before judging, failing to cut costs effectively. They also lack model selection criteria and struggle with large model pools, where full inference is costly and can exceed context limits. To address this, we propose RouteMoA, an efficient mixture-of-agents framework with dynamic routing. It employs a lightweight scorer to perform initial screening by predicting coarse-grained performance from the query, narrowing candidates to a high-potential subset without inference. A mixture of judges then refines these scores through lightweight self- and cross-assessment based on existing model outputs, providing posterior correction without additional inference. Finally, a model ranking mechanism selects models by balancing performance, cost, and latency. RouteMoA outperforms MoA across varying tasks and model pool sizes, reducing cost by 89.8% and latency by 63.6% in the large-scale model pool.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18130v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RareAlert: Aligning heterogeneous large language model reasoning for early rare disease risk screening</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18132</link><description>arXiv:2601.18132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missed and delayed diagnosis remains a major challenge in rare disease care. At the initial clinical encounters, physicians assess rare disease risk using only limited information under high uncertainty. When high-risk patients are not recognised at this stage, targeted diagnostic testing is often not initiated, resulting in missed diagnosis. Existing primary care triage processes are structurally insufficient to reliably identify patients with rare diseases at initial clinical presentation and universal screening is needed to reduce diagnostic delay. Here we present RareAlert, an early screening system which predict patient-level rare disease risk from routinely available primary-visit information. RareAlert integrates reasoning generated by ten LLMs, calibrates and weights these signals using machine learning, and distils the aligned reasoning into a single locally deployable model. To develop and evaluate RareAlert, we curated RareBench, a real-world dataset of 158,666 cases covering 33 Orphanet disease categories and more than 7,000 rare conditions, including both rare and non-rare presentations. The results showed that rare disease identification can be reconceptualised as a universal uncertainty resolution process applied to the general patient population. On an independent test set, RareAlert, a Qwen3-4B based model trained with calibrated reasoning signals, achieved an AUC of 0.917, outperforming the best machine learning ensemble and all evaluated LLMs, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, o3-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen3-235B. These findings demonstrate the diversity in LLM medical reasoning and the effectiveness of aligning such reasoning in highly uncertain clinical tasks. By incorporating calibrated reasoning into a single model, RareAlert enables accurate, privacy-preserving, and scalable rare disease risk screening suitable for large-scale local deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating Update Broadcasts Over LoRaWAN Downlink via D2D Cooperation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18134</link><description>arXiv:2601.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadcast distribution of updates (e.g., security patches, machine learning models) from a server to end devices (EDs) is a critical requirement in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we consider the problem of reliable over-the-air broadcast of updates in Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWANs). Existing broadcast techniques for LoRaWANs suffer from long delivery delays due to low data rates and duty-cycle constraints. We address this problem by proposing a device-level cooperative mechanism, in which updated EDs broadcast a few update fragments to accelerate delivery to their neighbors. We demonstrate large reductions in the delivery time compared to conventional methods. For instance, in a 400-node network spanning 1 km radius and operating at 1% duty-cycle, the proposed scheme reduces the time required to deliver a 10 kilobyte update to an ED at the network's edge from 42 hours to 45 minutes. The proposed solution thus provides a pathway toward improved security and efficient realization of edge intelligence in LoRaWAN IoT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18134v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Forward Consistency Learning with Gated Context Aggregation for Video Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18135</link><description>arXiv:2601.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a crucial element of public security, video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to measure deviations from normal patterns for various events in real-time surveillance systems. However, most existing VAD methods rely on large-scale models to pursue extreme accuracy, limiting their feasibility on resource-limited edge devices. Moreover, mainstream prediction-based VAD detects anomalies using only single-frame future prediction errors, overlooking the richer constraints from longer-term temporal forward information. In this paper, we introduce FoGA, a lightweight VAD model that performs Forward consistency learning with Gated context Aggregation, containing about 2M parameters and tailored for potential edge devices. Specifically, we propose a Unet-based method that performs feature extraction on consecutive frames to generate both immediate and forward predictions. Then, we introduce a gated context aggregation module into the skip connections to dynamically fuse encoder and decoder features at the same spatial scale. Finally, the model is jointly optimized with a novel forward consistency loss, and a hybrid anomaly measurement strategy is adopted to integrate errors from both immediate and forward frames for more accurate detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods, running up to 155 FPS. Hence, our FoGA achieves an excellent trade-off between performance and the efficiency metric.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18135v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepPlanning: Benchmarking Long-Horizon Agentic Planning with Verifiable Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18137</link><description>arXiv:2601.18137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While agent evaluation has shifted toward long-horizon tasks, most benchmarks still emphasize local, step-level reasoning rather than the global constrained optimization (e.g., time and financial budgets) that demands genuine planning ability. Meanwhile, existing LLM planning benchmarks underrepresent the active information gathering and fine-grained local constraints typical of real-world settings. To address this, we introduce DeepPlanning, a challenging benchmark for practical long-horizon agent planning. It features multi-day travel planning and multi-product shopping tasks that require proactive information acquisition, local constrained reasoning, and global constrained optimization. Evaluations on DeepPlanning show that even frontier agentic LLMs struggle with these problems, highlighting the importance of reliable explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use for achieving better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Error analysis further points to promising directions for improving agentic LLMs over long planning horizons. We open-source the code and data to support future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18137v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhance the Safety in Reinforcement Learning by ADRC Lagrangian Methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18142</link><description>arXiv:2601.18142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) seeks to maximize rewards while satisfying safety constraints, typically addressed through Lagrangian-based methods.

To address these limitations, we propose ADRC-Lagrangian methods that leverage Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) for enhanced robustness and reduced oscillations.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces safety violations by up to 74%, constraint violation magnitudes by 89%, and average costs by 67\%, establishing superior effectiveness for Safe RL in complex environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18142v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Think When Needed: Model-Aware Reasoning Routing for LLM-based Ranking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18146</link><description>arXiv:2601.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to ranking tasks in retrieval and recommendation. Although reasoning prompting can enhance ranking utility, our preliminary exploration reveals that its benefits are inconsistent and come at a substantial computational cost, suggesting that when to reason is as crucial as how to reason. To address this issue, we propose a reasoning routing framework that employs a lightweight, plug-and-play router head to decide whether to use direct inference (Non-Think) or reasoning (Think) for each instance before generation. The router head relies solely on pre-generation signals: i) compact ranking-aware features (e.g., candidate dispersion) and ii) model-aware difficulty signals derived from a diagnostic checklist reflecting the model's estimated need for reasoning. By leveraging these features before generation, the router outputs a controllable token that determines whether to apply the Think mode. Furthermore, the router can adaptively select its operating policy along the validation Pareto frontier during deployment, enabling dynamic allocation of computational resources toward instances most likely to benefit from Think under varying system constraints. Experiments on three public ranking datasets with different scales of open-source LLMs show consistent improvements in ranking utility with reduced token consumption (e.g., +6.3\% NDCG@10 with -49.5\% tokens on MovieLens with Qwen3-4B), demonstrating reasoning routing as a practical solution to the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Contact Plan Design For Optical Interplanetary Communications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18148</link><description>arXiv:2601.18148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space exploration missions generate rapidly increasing volumes of scientific telemetry that far exceed the capacity of today's manually scheduled, RF-based deep-space infrastructure. Free-space optical (FSO) communications promise orders of magnitude higher throughput, but their narrow beams require precise pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) for link establishment and tightly synchronized contact schedules. Critically, no existing contact plan design (CPD) framework accounts for optical head retargeting delay, the time spent during coarse pointing and link acquisition before data transmission begins, which directly reduces usable contact time. Retargeting delay is the dominant impairment unique to optical networks, which induces a seconds-to-minutes-long mechanical pointing process for an optical terminal's laser from its current partner to the next receiver. This paper introduces the first PAT-aware CPD framework for optical interplanetary backhaul networks. The model captures directional temporal flows across both direct-to-Earth optical links and two-hop relay paths using delay/disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) satellites. We also introduce an optical network duty-cycle metric that quantifies the proportion of time spent transmitting to the contact window duration, exposing capacity lost to retargeting delay. Our results show that our MILP scheduler delivers over 30 percent higher network capacity than a greedy algorithm. More importantly, the results uncover a fundamental behavioral shift: when retargeting delays are modeled accurately, optimal schedules favor fewer but longer optical links that maximize throughput while minimizing retargeting overhead. These findings demonstrate that zero-delay assumptions substantially overestimate achievable performance and yield unrealistic contact plans.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18148v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FP8-RL: A Practical and Stable Low-Precision Stack for LLM Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18150</link><description>arXiv:2601.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly bottlenecked by rollout (generation), where long output sequence lengths make attention and KV-cache memory dominate end-to-end step time. FP8 offers an attractive lever for accelerating RL by reducing compute cost and memory traffic during rollout, but applying FP8 in RL introduces unique engineering and algorithmic challenges: policy weights change every step (requiring repeated quantization and weight synchronization into the inference engine) and low-precision rollouts can deviate from the higher-precision policy assumed by the trainer, causing train-inference mismatch and potential instability. This report presents a practical FP8 rollout stack for LLM RL, implemented in the veRL ecosystem with support for common training backends (e.g., FSDP/Megatron-LM) and inference engines (e.g., vLLM/SGLang). We (i) enable FP8 W8A8 linear-layer rollout using blockwise FP8 quantization, (ii) extend FP8 to KV-cache to remove long-context memory bottlenecks via per-step QKV scale recalibration, and (iii) mitigate mismatch using importance-sampling-based rollout correction (token-level TIS/MIS variants). Across dense and MoE models, these techniques deliver up to 44% rollout throughput gains while preserving learning behavior comparable to BF16 baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explaining Synergistic Effects in Social Recommendations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18151</link><description>arXiv:2601.18151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social recommenders, the inherent nonlinearity and opacity of synergistic effects across multiple social networks hinders users from understanding how diverse information is leveraged for recommendations, consequently diminishing explainability. However, existing explainers can only identify the topological information in social networks that significantly influences recommendations, failing to further explain the synergistic effects among this information. Inspired by existing findings that synergistic effects enhance mutual information between inputs and predictions to generate information gain, we extend this discovery to graph data. We quantify graph information gain to identify subgraphs embodying synergistic effects. Based on the theoretical insights, we propose SemExplainer, which explains synergistic effects by identifying subgraphs that embody them. SemExplainer first extracts explanatory subgraphs from multi-view social networks to generate preliminary importance explanations for recommendations. A conditional entropy optimization strategy to maximize information gain is developed, thereby further identifying subgraphs that embody synergistic effects from explanatory subgraphs. Finally, SemExplainer searches for paths from users to recommended items within the synergistic subgraphs to generate explanations for the recommendations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of SemExplainer over baseline methods, providing superior explanations of synergistic effects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EndoExtract: Co-Designing Structured Text Extraction from Endometriosis Ultrasound Reports</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18154</link><description>arXiv:2601.18154v1 Announce Type: new

Through contextual inquiry with research assistants, we identified key workflow pain points: asymmetric trust between numerical and interpretive fields, repetitive manual highlighting, fatigue from sustained comparison, and terminology inconsistency across radiologists. These findings informed an interface that surfaces only interpretive fields for mandatory review, automatically highlights source evidence within PDFs, and separates batch extraction from human-paced verification. A formative workshop revealed that \textbf{EndoExtract} supports a shift from field-by-field data entry to supervisory validation, though participants noted risks of over-skimming and challenges in managing missing data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18154v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Pairwise Comparisons: A Distributional Test of Distinctiveness for Machine-Generated Works in Intellectual Property Law</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18156</link><description>arXiv:2601.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key doctrines, including novelty (patent), originality (copyright), and distinctiveness (trademark), turn on a shared empirical question: whether a body of work is meaningfully distinct from a relevant reference class. Yet analyses typically operationalize this set-level inquiry using item-level evidence: pairwise comparisons among exemplars. That unit-of-analysis mismatch may be manageable for finite corpora of human-created works, where it can be bridged by ad hoc aggregations. But it becomes acute for machine-generated works, where the object of evaluation is not a fixed set of works but a generative process with an effectively unbounded output space. We propose a distributional alternative: a two-sample test based on maximum mean discrepancy computed on semantic embeddings to determine if two creative processes-whether human or machine-produce statistically distinguishable output distributions. The test requires no task-specific training-obviating the need for discovery of proprietary training data to characterize the generative process-and is sample-efficient, often detecting differences with as few as 5-10 images and 7-20 texts. We validate the framework across three domains: handwritten digits (controlled images), patent abstracts (text), and AI-generated art (real-world images). We reveal a perceptual paradox: even when human evaluators distinguish AI outputs from human-created art with only about 58% accuracy, our method detects distributional distinctiveness. Our results present evidence contrary to the view that generative models act as mere regurgitators of training data. Rather than producing outputs statistically indistinguishable from a human baseline-as simple regurgitation would predict-they produce outputs that are semantically human-like yet stochastically distinct, suggesting their dominant function is as a semantic interpolator within a learned latent space.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Very Long Video Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18157</link><description>arXiv:2601.18157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of always-on personal AI assistants, enabled by all-day wearable devices such as smart glasses, demands a new level of contextual understanding, one that goes beyond short, isolated events to encompass the continuous, longitudinal stream of egocentric video. Achieving this vision requires advances in long-horizon video understanding, where systems must interpret and recall visual and audio information spanning days or even weeks. Existing methods, including large language models and retrieval-augmented generation, are constrained by limited context windows and lack the ability to perform compositional, multi-hop reasoning over very long video streams. In this work, we address these challenges through EGAgent, an enhanced agentic framework centered on entity scene graphs, which represent people, places, objects, and their relationships over time. Our system equips a planning agent with tools for structured search and reasoning over these graphs, as well as hybrid visual and audio search capabilities, enabling detailed, cross-modal, and temporally coherent reasoning. Experiments on the EgoLifeQA and Video-MME (Long) datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on EgoLifeQA (57.5%) and competitive performance on Video-MME (Long) (74.1%) for complex longitudinal video understanding tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18157v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Initial Evaluation of Distributed Graph Algorithms using NWGraph and HPX</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18158</link><description>arXiv:2601.18158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are central to modeling relationships in scientific computing, data analysis, and AI/ML, but their growing scale can exceed the memory and compute capacity of single nodes, requiring distributed solutions. Existing distributed graph framework, however, face fundamental challenges: graph algorithms are latency-bound, suffer from irregular memory access, and often impose synchronization costs that limit scalability and efficiency. In this work, we present a distributed implementation of the NWGraph library integrated with the HPX runtime system. By leveraging HPX's asynchronous many-task model, our approach aims to reduce synchronization overhead, improve load balance, and provide a foundation for distributed graph analytics. We evaluate this approach using two representative algorithms: Breadth-First-Search (BFS) and (PageRank). Our initial results show that BFS achieves better performance than the distributed Boost Graph Library (BGL), while PageRank remains more challenging, with current implementation not yet outperforming BGL. These findings highlight both the promise and the open challenges of applying asynchronous task-based runtimes to graph processing, and point to opportunities for future optimizations and extensions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18158v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fine-Grained Emotion Detection on GoEmotions: Experimental Comparison of Classical Machine Learning, BiLSTM, and Transformer Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18162</link><description>arXiv:2601.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition is a challenging multi-label NLP task due to label overlap and class imbalance. In this work, we benchmark three modeling families on the GoEmotions dataset: a TF-IDF-based logistic regression system trained with binary relevance, a BiLSTM with attention, and a BERT model fine-tuned for multi-label classification. Experiments follow the official train/validation/test split, and imbalance is mitigated using inverse-frequency class weights. Across several metrics, namely Micro-F1, Macro-F1, Hamming Loss, and Subset Accuracy, we observe that logistic regression attains the highest Micro-F1 of 0.51, while BERT achieves the best overall balance surpassing the official paper's reported results, reaching Macro-F1 0.49, Hamming Loss 0.036, and Subset Accuracy 0.36. This suggests that frequent emotions often rely on surface lexical cues, whereas contextual representations improve performance on rarer emotions and more ambiguous examples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18162v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TempDiffReg: Temporal Diffusion Model for Non-Rigid 2D-3D Vascular Registration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18168</link><description>arXiv:2601.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a preferred treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma and other liver malignancies, yet it remains a highly challenging procedure due to complex intra-operative vascular navigation and anatomical variability. Accurate and robust 2D-3D vessel registration is essential to guide microcatheter and instruments during TACE, enabling precise localization of vascular structures and optimal therapeutic targeting. To tackle this issue, we develop a coarse-to-fine registration strategy. First, we introduce a global alignment module, structure-aware perspective n-point (SA-PnP), to establish correspondence between 2D and 3D vessel structures. Second, we propose TempDiffReg, a temporal diffusion model that performs vessel deformation iteratively by leveraging temporal context to capture complex anatomical variations and local structural changes. We collected data from 23 patients and constructed 626 paired multi-frame samples for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both accuracy and anatomical plausibility. Specifically, our method achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.63 mm and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.51 mm in registration accuracy, representing 66.7\% lower MSE and 17.7\% lower MAE compared to the most competitive existing approaches. It has the potential to assist less-experienced clinicians in safely and efficiently performing complex TACE procedures, ultimately enhancing both surgical outcomes and patient care.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to mitigate performance degradation when training and testing data are sampled from different distributions. While significant progress has been made in enhancing overall accuracy, most existing methods overlook performance disparities across categories-an issue we refer to as category fairness. Our empirical analysis reveals that UDA classifiers tend to favor certain easy categories while neglecting difficult ones. To address this, we propose Virtual Label-distribution-aware Learning (VILL), a simple yet effective framework designed to improve worst-case performance while preserving high overall accuracy. The core of VILL is an adaptive re-weighting strategy that amplifies the influence of hard-to-classify categories. Furthermore, we introduce a KL-divergence-based re-balancing strategy, which explicitly adjusts decision boundaries to enhance category fairness. Experiments on commonly used datasets demonstrate that VILL can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module into existing UDA methods, significantly improving category fairness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18171v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] YOLO-DS: Fine-Grained Feature Decoupling via Dual-Statistic Synergy Operator for Object Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18172</link><description>arXiv:2601.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-stage object detection, particularly the YOLO series, strikes a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, existing YOLO detectors lack explicit modeling of heterogeneous object responses within shared feature channels, which limits further performance gains. To address this, we propose YOLO-DS, a framework built around a novel Dual-Statistic Synergy Operator (DSO). The DSO decouples object features by jointly modeling the channel-wise mean and the peak-to-mean difference. Building upon the DSO, we design two lightweight gating modules: the Dual-Statistic Synergy Gating (DSG) module for adaptive channel-wise feature selection, and the Multi-Path Segmented Gating (MSG) module for depth-wise feature weighting. On the MS-COCO benchmark, YOLO-DS consistently outperforms YOLOv8 across five model scales (N, S, M, L, X), achieving AP gains of 1.1% to 1.7% with only a minimal increase in inference latency. Extensive visualization, ablation, and comparative studies validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superior capability in discriminating heterogeneous objects with high efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18172v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Success Conditioning as Policy Improvement: The Optimization Problem Solved by Imitating Success</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18175</link><description>arXiv:2601.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A widely used technique for improving policies is success conditioning, in which one collects trajectories, identifies those that achieve a desired outcome, and updates the policy to imitate the actions taken along successful trajectories. This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $\chi^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18175v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lip-Siri: Contactless Open-Sentence Silent Speech with Wi-Fi Backscatter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18177</link><description>arXiv:2601.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silent speech interfaces (SSIs) enable silent interaction in noise-sensitive or privacy-sensitive settings. However, existing SSIs face practical deployment trade-offs among privacy, user experience, and energy consumption, and most remain limited to closed-set recognition over small, pre-defined vocabularies of words or sentences, which restricts real-world expressiveness. In this paper, we present Lip-Siri, to the best of our knowledge, the first Wi-Fi backscatter--based SSI that supports open-vocabulary sentence recognition via lexicon-guided subword decoding. Lip-Siri designs a frequency-shifted backscatter tag to isolate tag-modulated reflections and suppress interference from non-target motions, enabling reliable extraction of lip-motion traces from ubiquitous Wi-Fi signals. We then segment continuous traces into lip-motion units, cluster them, learn robust unit representations via cluster-based self-supervision, and finally propose a lexicon-guided Transformer encoder--decoder with beam search to decode variable-length sentence sequences. We implement an end-to-end prototype and evaluate it with 15 participants on 340 sentences and 3,398 words across multiple scenarios. Lip-Siri achieves 85.61% accuracy on word prediction and a WER of 36.87% on continuous sentence recognition, approaching the performance of representative vision-based lip-reading systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18177v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Customizable Interactive Tools for Therapeutic Homework Support in Mental Health Counseling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18179</link><description>arXiv:2601.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Therapeutic homework (i.e., tasks assigned by therapists for clients to complete between sessions) is essential for effective psychotherapy, yet therapists often interpret fragmented client logs, assessments, and reflections within limited preparation time. Our formative study with licensed therapists revealed three critical design requirements: support for interpreting unstructured client self-reports, customization aligned with clinical objectives, and seamless integration across multiple data sources. We then designed and developed TheraTrack, a customizable, therapist-facing tool that integrates multi-dimensional data and leverages large language models to generate traceable summaries and support natural-language queries, to streamline between-session homework tracking. Our pilot study with 14 therapists showed that TheraTrack reduced their cognitive load, enabled verification through direct navigation from AI summaries to original data entries, and was adapted differently for private analysis compared to in-session use, with dependence varying based on therapist experience and usage duration. We also discuss design implications for clinician-centered AI for mental health.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18179v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VIBEVOICE-ASR Technical Report</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18184</link><description>arXiv:2601.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice-ASR, a general-purpose speech understanding framework built upon VibeVoice, designed to address the persistent challenges of context fragmentation and multi-speaker complexity in long-form audio (e.g., meetings, podcasts) that remain despite recent advancements in short-form speech recognition. Unlike traditional pipelined approaches that rely on audio chunking, VibeVoice-ASRsupports single-pass processing for up to 60 minutes of audio. It unifies Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Diarization, and Timestamping into a single end-to-end generation task. In addition, VibeVoice-ASR supports over 50 languages, requires no explicit language setting, and natively handles code-switching within and across utterances. Furthermore, we introduce a prompt-based context injection mechanism that allows users to supply customized conetxt, significantly improving accuracy on domain-specific terminology and polyphonic character disambiguation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18184v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trajectory-Based RBF Collocation Method for Surface Advection-Diffusion Equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18186</link><description>arXiv:2601.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Trajectory-Based RBF Collocation (TBRBF) method for solving surface advection-diffusion equations on smooth, compact manifolds. TBRBF decouples advection and diffusion by applying a characteristic treatment with a Kansa-type RBF collocation method for diffusion PDE, which yields an operator-split characteristic (OSC) system comprising a characteristic ODE and a diffusion PDE. We rigorously prove the equivalence between the OSC system and the original surface PDE on manifolds by embedding the latter into a narrow band domain. Using an intrinsic approach, we construct a time-continuous embedded PDE with push-forward operators in each chart of the atlas and establish its equivalence with the OSC system in the narrow band. Restricting the solution back to the manifold recovers the OSC system on manifolds, ensuring that the method introduces no operator splitting error. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the robust stability and accuracy of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] \textsc{NaVIDA}: Vision-Language Navigation with Inverse Dynamics Augmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18188</link><description>arXiv:2601.18188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to interpret natural language instructions and act coherently in visually rich environments. However, most existing methods rely on reactive state-action mappings without explicitly modeling how actions causally transform subsequent visual observations. Lacking such vision-action causality, agents cannot anticipate the visual changes induced by its own actions, leading to unstable behaviors, weak generalization, and cumulative error along trajectory. To address these issues, we introduce \textsc{NaVIDA} (\textbf{Nav}igation with \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{D}ynamics \textbf{A}ugmentation), a unified VLN framework that couples policy learning with action-grounded visual dynamics and adaptive execution. \textsc{NaVIDA} augments training with chunk-based inverse-dynamics supervision to learn causal relationship between visual changes and corresponding actions. To structure this supervision and extend the effective planning range, \textsc{NaVIDA} employs hierarchical probabilistic action chunking (HPAC), which organizes trajectories into multi-step chunks and provides discriminative, longer-range visual-change cues. To further curb error accumulation and stabilize behavior at inference, an entropy-guided mechanism adaptively sets the execution horizon of action chunks. Extensive experiments show that \textsc{NaVIDA} achieves superior navigation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters (3B vs. 8B). Real-world robot evaluations further validate the practical feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Code and data will be available upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18188v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smooth, Sparse, and Stable: Finite-Time Exact Skeleton Recovery via Smoothed Proximal Gradients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18189</link><description>arXiv:2601.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous optimization has significantly advanced causal discovery, yet existing methods (e.g., NOTEARS) generally guarantee only asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. This often yields dense weighted matrices that require arbitrary post-hoc thresholding to recover a DAG. This gap between continuous optimization and discrete graph structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing the Hybrid-Order Acyclicity Constraint (AHOC) and optimizing it via the Smoothed Proximal Gradient (SPG-AHOC). Leveraging the Manifold Identification Property of proximal algorithms, we provide a rigorous theoretical guarantee: the Finite-Time Oracle Property. We prove that under standard identifiability assumptions, SPG-AHOC recovers the exact DAG support (structure) in finite iterations, even when optimizing a smoothed approximation. This result eliminates structural ambiguity, as our algorithm returns graphs with exact zero entries without heuristic truncation. Empirically, SPG-AHOC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and strongly corroborates the finite-time identification theory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18189v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Perspective Subimage CLIP with Keyword Guidance for Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18190</link><description>arXiv:2601.18190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models like CLIP have significantly advanced Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR). However, existing methods predominantly rely on coarse-grained global alignment, which often overlooks the dense, multi-scale semantics inherent in overhead imagery. Moreover, adapting these heavy models via full fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational costs and risks catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose MPS-CLIP, a parameter-efficient framework designed to shift the retrieval paradigm from global matching to keyword-guided fine-grained alignment. Specifically, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract core semantic keywords, guiding the Segment Anything Model (SamGeo) to generate semantically relevant sub-perspectives. To efficiently adapt the frozen backbone, we introduce a Gated Global Attention (G^2A) adapter, which captures global context and long-range dependencies with minimal overhead. Furthermore, a Multi-Perspective Representation (MPR) module aggregates these local cues into robust multi-perspective embeddings. The framework is optimized via a hybrid objective combining multi-perspective contrastive and weighted triplet losses, which dynamically selects maximum-response perspectives to suppress noise and enforce precise semantic matching. Extensive experiments on the RSICD and RSITMD benchmarks demonstrate that MPS-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 35.18% and 48.40% mean Recall (mR), respectively, significantly outperforming full fine-tuning baselines and recent competitive methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing human dynamic visual perception from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is of great research significance since EEG's non-invasiveness and high temporal resolution. However, EEG-to-video reconstruction remains challenging due to: 1) Single Modality: existing studies solely align EEG signals with the text modality, which ignores other modalities and are prone to suffer from overfitting problems; 2) Data Scarcity: current methods often have difficulty training to converge with limited EEG-video data. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel framework MindCine to achieve high-fidelity video reconstructions on limited data. We employ a multimodal joint learning strategy to incorporate beyond-text modalities in the training stage and leverage a pre-trained large EEG model to relieve the data scarcity issue for decoding semantic information, while a Seq2Seq model with causal attention is specifically designed for decoding perceptual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, the results underscore the effectiveness of the complementary strengths of different modalities and demonstrate that leveraging a large-scale EEG model can further enhance reconstruction performance by alleviating the challenges associated with limited data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18192v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] InkIdeator: Supporting Chinese-Style Visual Design Ideation via AI-Infused Exploration of Chinese Paintings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18193</link><description>arXiv:2601.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual designers often seek inspiration from Chinese paintings when tasked with creating Chinese-style illustrations, posters, etc. Our formative study (N=10) reveals that during ideation, designers learn the cultural symbols, emotions, compositions, and styles in Chinese paintings but face challenges in searching, analyzing, and integrating these dimensions. This paper leverages multi-modal large models to annotate the value of each dimension in 16,315 Chinese paintings, built on which we propose InkIdeator, an ideation support system for Chinese-style visual designs. InkIdeator suggests cultural symbols associated with the task theme, provides dimensional keywords to help analyze Chinese paintings, and generates visual examples integrating user-selected keywords. Our within-subjects study (N=12) using a baseline system without extracted dimensional keywords, along with two extended use cases by Chinese painters, indicates InkIdeator's effectiveness in creative ideation support, helping users efficiently explore cultural dimensions in Chinese paintings and visualize their ideas. We discuss implications for supporting culture-related visual design ideation with generative AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18193v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QualiRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Visual Quality Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18195</link><description>arXiv:2601.18195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual quality assessment (VQA) is increasingly shifting from scalar score prediction toward interpretable quality understanding -- a paradigm that demands \textit{fine-grained spatiotemporal perception} and \textit{auxiliary contextual information}. Current approaches rely on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning on curated instruction datasets, which involve labor-intensive annotation and are prone to dataset-specific biases. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{QualiRAG}, a \textit{training-free} \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{G}eneration \textbf{(RAG)} framework that systematically leverages the latent perceptual knowledge of large multimodal models (LMMs) for visual quality perception. Unlike conventional RAG that retrieves from static corpora, QualiRAG dynamically generates auxiliary knowledge by decomposing questions into structured requests and constructing four complementary knowledge sources: \textit{visual metadata}, \textit{subject localization}, \textit{global quality summaries}, and \textit{local quality descriptions}, followed by relevance-aware retrieval for evidence-grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments show that QualiRAG achieves substantial improvements over open-source general-purpose LMMs and VQA-finetuned LMMs on visual quality understanding tasks, and delivers competitive performance on visual quality comparison tasks, demonstrating robust quality assessment capabilities without any task-specific training.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced GUI agents' capabilities in parsing textual instructions, interpreting screen content, and executing tasks, a critical challenge persists: the irreversibility of agent operations, where a single erroneous action can trigger catastrophic deviations. To address this, we propose the GUI Action Critic's Data Flywheel System (GAIA), a training framework that enables the models to have iterative critic capabilities, which are used to improve the Test-Time Scaling (TTS) of basic GUI agents' performance. Specifically, we train an Intuitive Critic Model (ICM) using positive and negative action examples from a base agent first. This critic evaluates the immediate correctness of the agent's intended actions, thereby selecting operations with higher success probability. Then, the initial critic guides agent actions to collect refined positive/negative samples, initiating the self-improving cycle. The augmented data then trains a second-round critic with enhanced discernment capability.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are eminently suitable for wireless resource management, thanks to their scalability, but they still face computational challenges in large-scale, dense networks in classical computers. The integration of quantum computing with GNNs offers a promising pathway for enhancing computational efficiency because they reduce the model complexity. This is achieved by leveraging the quantum advantages of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), while retaining the expressive power of GNNs. However, existing pure quantum message passing models remain constrained by the limited number of qubits, hence limiting the scalability of their application to the wireless systems. As a remedy, we conceive a Scalable Quantum Message Passing Graph Neural Network (SQM-GNN) relying on a quantum message passing architecture. To address the aforementioned scalability issue, we decompose the graph into subgraphs and apply a shared PQC to each local subgraph. Importantly, the model incorporates both node and edge features, facilitating the full representation of the underlying wireless graph structure. We demonstrate the efficiency of SQM GNN on a device-to-device (D2D) power control task, where it outperforms both classical GNNs and heuristic baselines. These results highlight SQM-GNN as a promising direction for future wireless network optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18198v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UTune: Towards Uncertainty-Aware Online Index Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18199</link><description>arXiv:2601.18199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been a flurry of recent proposals on learned benefit estimators for index tuning. Although these learned estimators show promising improvement over what-if query optimizer calls in terms of the accuracy of estimated index benefit, they face significant limitations when applied to online index tuning, an arguably more common and more challenging scenario in real-world applications. There are two major challenges for learned index benefit estimators in online tuning: (1) limited amount of query execution feedback that can be used to train the models, and (2) constant coming of new unseen queries due to workload drifts. The combination of the two hinders the generalization capability of existing learned index benefit estimators. To overcome these challenges, we present UTune, an uncertainty-aware online index tuning framework that employs operator-level learned models with improved generalization over unseen queries. At the core of UTune is an uncertainty quantification mechanism that characterizes the inherent uncertainty of the operator-level learned models given limited online execution feedback. We further integrate uncertainty information into index selection and configuration enumeration, the key component of any index tuner, by developing a new variant of the classic $\epsilon$-greedy search strategy with uncertainty-weighted index benefits. Experimental evaluation shows that UTune not only significantly improves the workload execution time compared to state-of-the-art online index tuners but also reduces the index exploration overhead, resulting in faster convergence when the workload is relatively stable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18199v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HeterCSI: Channel-Adaptive Heterogeneous CSI Pretraining Framework for Generalized Wireless Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18200</link><description>arXiv:2601.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless foundation models promise transformative capabilities for channel state information (CSI) processing across diverse 6G network applications, yet face fundamental challenges due to the inherent dual heterogeneity of CSI across both scale and scenario dimensions. However, current pretraining approaches either constrain inputs to fixed dimensions or isolate training by scale, limiting the generalization and scalability of wireless foundation models. In this paper, we propose HeterCSI, a channel-adaptive pretraining framework that reconciles training efficiency with robust cross-scenario generalization via a new understanding of gradient dynamics in heterogeneous CSI pretraining. Our key insight reveals that CSI scale heterogeneity primarily causes destructive gradient interference, while scenario diversity actually promotes constructive gradient alignment when properly managed. Specifically, we formulate heterogeneous CSI batch construction as a partitioning optimization problem that minimizes zero-padding overhead while preserving scenario diversity. To solve this, we develop a scale-aware adaptive batching strategy that aligns CSI samples of similar scales, and design a double-masking mechanism to isolate valid signals from padding artifacts. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that HeterCSI establishes a generalized foundation model without scenario-specific finetuning, achieving superior average performance over full-shot baselines. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot benchmark WiFo, it reduces NMSE by 7.19 dB, 4.08 dB, and 5.27 dB for CSI reconstruction, time-domain, and frequency-domain prediction, respectively. The proposed HeterCSI framework also reduces training latency by 53% compared to existing approaches while improving generalization performance by 1.53 dB on average.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18200v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAGE: Steerable Agentic Data Generation for Deep Search with Execution Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18202</link><description>arXiv:2601.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep search agents, which aim to answer complex questions requiring reasoning across multiple documents, can significantly speed up the information-seeking process. Collecting human annotations for this application is prohibitively expensive due to long and complex exploration trajectories. We propose an agentic pipeline that automatically generates high quality, difficulty-controlled deep search question-answer pairs for a given corpus and a target difficulty level. Our pipeline, SAGE, consists of a data generator which proposes QA pairs and a search agent which attempts to solve the generated question and provide execution feedback for the data generator. The two components interact over multiple rounds to iteratively refine the question-answer pairs until they satisfy the target difficulty level. Our intrinsic evaluation shows SAGE generates questions that require diverse reasoning strategies, while significantly increases the correctness and difficulty of the generated data. Our extrinsic evaluation demonstrates up to 23% relative performance gain on popular deep search benchmarks by training deep search agents with our synthetic data. Additional experiments show that agents trained on our data can adapt from fixed-corpus retrieval to Google Search at inference time, without further training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18202v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DMAP: Human-Aligned Structural Document Map for Multimodal Document Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18203</link><description>arXiv:2601.18203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing multimodal document question-answering (QA) systems predominantly rely on flat semantic retrieval, representing documents as a set of disconnected text chunks and largely neglecting their intrinsic hierarchical and relational structures. Such flattening disrupts logical and spatial dependencies - such as section organization, figure-text correspondence, and cross-reference relations, that humans naturally exploit for comprehension. To address this limitation, we introduce a document-level structural Document MAP (DMAP), which explicitly encodes both hierarchical organization and inter-element relationships within multimodal documents. Specifically, we design a Structured-Semantic Understanding Agent to construct DMAP by organizing textual content together with figures, tables, charts, etc. into a human-aligned hierarchical schema that captures both semantic and layout dependencies. Building upon this representation, a Reflective Reasoning Agent performs structure-aware and evidence-driven reasoning, dynamically assessing the sufficiency of retrieved context and iteratively refining answers through targeted interactions with DMAP. Extensive experiments on MMDocQA benchmarks demonstrate that DMAP yields document-specific structural representations aligned with human interpretive patterns, substantially enhancing retrieval precision, reasoning consistency, and multimodal comprehension over conventional RAG-based approaches.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents operating in long-horizon interactions require memory systems that support temporal consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and evidence-grounded reuse across sessions. Existing approaches largely rely on unstructured retrieval or coarse abstractions, which often lead to temporal conflicts, brittle reasoning, and limited traceability. We propose MemWeaver, a unified memory framework that consolidates long-term agent experiences into three interconnected components: a temporally grounded graph memory for structured relational reasoning, an experience memory that abstracts recurring interaction patterns from repeated observations, and a passage memory that preserves original textual evidence. MemWeaver employs a dual-channel retrieval strategy that jointly retrieves structured knowledge and supporting evidence to construct compact yet information-dense contexts for reasoning. Experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemWeaver substantially improves multi-hop and temporal reasoning accuracy while reducing input context length by over 95\% compared to long-context baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18204v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PaperSearchQA: Learning to Search and Reason over Scientific Papers with RLVR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18207</link><description>arXiv:2601.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search agents are language models (LMs) that reason and search knowledge bases (or the web) to answer questions; recent methods supervise only the final answer accuracy using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Most RLVR search agents tackle general-domain QA, which limits their relevance to technical AI systems in science, engineering, and medicine. In this work we propose training agents to search and reason over scientific papers -- this tests technical question-answering, it is directly relevant to real scientists, and the capabilities will be crucial to future AI Scientist systems. Concretely, we release a search corpus of 16 million biomedical paper abstracts and construct a challenging factoid QA dataset called PaperSearchQA with 60k samples answerable from the corpus, along with benchmarks. We train search agents in this environment to outperform non-RL retrieval baselines; we also perform further quantitative analysis and observe interesting agent behaviors like planning, reasoning, and self-verification. Our corpus, datasets, and benchmarks are usable with the popular Search-R1 codebase for RLVR training and released on https://huggingface.co/collections/jmhb/papersearchqa. Finally, our data creation methods are scalable and easily extendable to other scientific domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative Chain of Behavior for User Trajectory Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18213</link><description>arXiv:2601.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling long-term user behavior trajectories is essential for understanding evolving preferences and enabling proactive recommendations. However, most sequential recommenders focus on next-item prediction, overlooking dependencies across multiple future actions. We propose Generative Chain of Behavior (GCB), a generative framework that models user interactions as an autoregressive chain of semantic behaviors over multiple future steps. GCB first encodes items into semantic IDs via RQ-VAE with k-means refinement, forming a discrete latent space that preserves semantic proximity. On top of this space, a transformer-based autoregressive generator predicts multi-step future behaviors conditioned on user history, capturing long-horizon intent transitions and generating coherent trajectories. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that GCB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommenders in multi-step accuracy and trajectory consistency. Beyond these gains, GCB offers a unified generative formulation for capturing user preference evolution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18213v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rhea: Detecting Privilege-Escalated Evasive Ransomware Attacks Using Format-Aware Validation in the Cloud</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18216</link><description>arXiv:2601.18216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ransomware variants increasingly combine privilege escalation with sophisticated evasion strategies such as intermittent encryption, low-entropy encryption, and imitation attacks. Such powerful ransomware variants, privilege-escalated evasive ransomware (PEER), can defeat existing solutions relying on I/O-pattern analysis by tampering with or obfuscating I/O traces. Meanwhile, conventional statistical content-based detection becomes unreliable as the encryption size decreases due to sampling noises. We present Rhea, a cloud-offloaded ransomware defense system that analyzes replicated data snapshots, so-called mutation snapshots. Rhea introduces Format-Aware Validation that validates the syntactic and semantic correctness of file formats, instead of relying on statistical or entropy-based indicators. By leveraging file-format specifications as detection invariants, Rhea can reliably identify fine-grained and evasive encryption even under elevated attacker privileges. Our evaluation demonstrates that Rhea significantly outperforms existing approaches, establishing its practical effectiveness against modern ransomware threats.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18216v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Paying Less Generalization Tax: A Cross-Domain Generalization Study of RL Training for LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18217</link><description>arXiv:2601.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalist LLM agents are often post-trained on a narrow set of environments but deployed across far broader, unseen domains. In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18217v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PaperTok: Exploring the Use of Generative AI for Creating Short-form Videos for Research Communication</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18218</link><description>arXiv:2601.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dissemination of scholarly research is critical, yet researchers often lack the time and skills to create engaging content for popular media such as short-form videos. To address this gap, we explore the use of generative AI to help researchers transform their academic papers into accessible video content. Informed by a formative study with science communicators and content creators (N=8), we designed PaperTok, an end-to-end system that automates the initial creative labor by generating script options and corresponding audiovisual content from a source paper. Researchers can then refine based on their preferences with further prompting. A mixed-methods user study (N=18) and crowdsourced evaluation (N=100) demonstrate that PaperTok's workflow can help researchers create engaging and informative short-form videos. We also identified the need for more fine-grained controls in the creation process. To this end, we offer implications for future generative tools that support science outreach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18218v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-ForcedAligner: A Non-Autoregressive and Accurate LLM-Based Forced Aligner for Multilingual and Long-Form Speech</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18220</link><description>arXiv:2601.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forced alignment (FA) predicts start and end timestamps for words or characters in speech, but existing methods are language-specific and prone to cumulative temporal shifts. The multilingual speech understanding and long-sequence processing abilities of speech large language models (SLLMs) make them promising for FA in multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech settings. However, directly applying the next-token prediction paradigm of SLLMs to FA results in hallucinations and slow inference. To bridge the gap, we propose LLM-ForcedAligner, reformulating FA as a slot-filling paradigm: timestamps are treated as discrete indices, and special timestamp tokens are inserted as slots into the transcript. Conditioned on the speech embeddings and the transcript with slots, the SLLM directly predicts the time indices at slots. During training, causal attention masking with non-shifted input and label sequences allows each slot to predict its own timestamp index based on itself and preceding context, with loss computed only at slot positions. Dynamic slot insertion enables FA at arbitrary positions. Moreover, non-autoregressive inference is supported, avoiding hallucinations and improving speed. Experiments across multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech scenarios show that LLM-ForcedAligner achieves a 69%~78% relative reduction in accumulated averaging shift compared with prior methods. The checkpoint and inference code will be released later.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18220v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HomoFM: Deep Homography Estimation with Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18222</link><description>arXiv:2601.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep homography estimation has broad applications in computer vision and robotics. Remarkable progresses have been achieved while the existing methods typically treat it as a direct regression or iterative refinement problem and often struggling to capture complex geometric transformations or generalize across different domains. In this work, we propose HomoFM, a new framework that introduces the flow matching technique from generative modeling into the homography estimation task for the first time. Unlike the existing methods, we formulate homography estimation problem as a velocity field learning problem. By modeling a continuous and point-wise velocity field that transforms noisy distributions into registered coordinates, the proposed network recovers high-precision transformations through a conditional flow trajectory. Furthermore, to address the challenge of domain shifts issue, e.g., the cases of multimodal matching or varying illumination scenarios, we integrate a gradient reversal layer (GRL) into the feature extraction backbone. This domain adaptation strategy explicitly constrains the encoder to learn domain-invariant representations, significantly enhancing the network's robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that HomoFM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both estimation accuracy and robustness on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: We study the generalized conditional gradient (GCG) method for time-dependent second-order mean field games (MFG) with local coupling terms. While explicit convergence rates of the GCG method were previously established only for globally coupled interactions, the assumptions used there fail to cover typical local interactions such as congestion effects. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a refined analytical framework adapted to local couplings and derive explicit convergence estimates in terms of the exploitability and optimality gap. The key difficulty lies in establishing uniform bounds on the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman solutions; this is solved via the Cole--Hopf transformation under a standard quadratic Hamiltonian with a convection effect. We further provide numerical experiments demonstrating convergence behavior and confirming the theoretical rates. Additionally, the existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions to the MFG system with locally coupled interactions are established.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18224v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ShopSimulator: Evaluating and Exploring RL-Driven LLM Agent for Shopping Assistants</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18225</link><description>arXiv:2601.18225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in e-commerce shopping. To perform thorough, user-tailored product searches, agents should interpret personal preferences, engage in multi-turn dialogues, and ultimately retrieve and discriminate among highly similar products. However, existing research has yet to provide a unified simulation environment that consistently captures all of these aspects, and always focuses solely on evaluation benchmarks without training support. In this paper, we introduce ShopSimulator, a large-scale and challenging Chinese shopping environment. Leveraging ShopSimulator, we evaluate LLMs across diverse scenarios, finding that even the best-performing models achieve less than 40% full-success rate. Error analysis reveals that agents struggle with deep search and product selection in long trajectories, fail to balance the use of personalization cues, and to effectively engage with users. Further training exploration provides practical guidance for overcoming these weaknesses, with the combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) yielding significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Conventional agent systems often struggle in open-ended environments where task distributions continuously drift and external supervision is scarce. Their reliance on static toolsets or offline training lags behind these dynamics, leaving the system's capability boundaries rigid and unknown. To address this, we propose the In-Situ Self-Evolving paradigm. This approach treats sequential task interactions as a continuous stream of experience, enabling the system to distill short-term execution feedback into long-term, reusable capabilities without access to ground-truth labels. Within this framework, we identify tool evolution as the critical pathway for capability expansion, which provides verifiable, binary feedback signals. Within this framework, we develop Yunjue Agent, a system that iteratively synthesizes, optimizes, and reuses tools to navigate emerging challenges. To optimize evolutionary efficiency, we further introduce a Parallel Batch Evolution strategy. Empirical evaluations across five diverse benchmarks under a zero-start setting demonstrate significant performance gains over proprietary baselines. Additionally, complementary warm-start evaluations confirm that the accumulated general knowledge can be seamlessly transferred to novel domains. Finally, we propose a novel metric to monitor evolution convergence, serving as a function analogous to training loss in conventional optimization. We open-source our codebase, system traces, and evolved tools to facilitate future research in resilient, self-evolving intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18226v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Facial Emotion Recognition on FER-2013 using an EfficientNetB2-Based Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18228</link><description>arXiv:2601.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of human emotions based on facial images in real-world scenarios is a difficult task due to low image quality, variations in lighting, pose changes, background distractions, small inter-class variations, noisy crowd-sourced labels, and severe class imbalance, as observed in the FER-2013 dataset of 48x48 grayscale images. Although recent approaches using large CNNs such as VGG and ResNet achieve reasonable accuracy, they are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting their practicality for real-time applications. We address these challenges using a lightweight and efficient facial emotion recognition pipeline based on EfficientNetB2, trained using a two-stage warm-up and fine-tuning strategy. The model is enhanced with AdamW optimization, decoupled weight decay, label smoothing (epsilon = 0.06) to reduce annotation noise, and clipped class weights to mitigate class imbalance, along with dropout, mixed-precision training, and extensive real-time data augmentation. The model is trained using a stratified 87.5%/12.5% train-validation split while keeping the official test set intact, achieving a test accuracy of 68.78% with nearly ten times fewer parameters than VGG16-based baselines. Experimental results, including per-class metrics and learning dynamics, demonstrate stable training and strong generalization, making the proposed approach suitable for real-time and edge-based applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Using LibCal Seats to Better Serve Students</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18230</link><description>arXiv:2601.18230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter examines the evolution of library services at the University of Li\`ege (ULi\`ege), with a focus on the implementation and assessment of the LibCal Seats booking module. Introduced in September 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this system was designed to manage occupancy and maintain social distancing. While initially a temporary measure, the seat booking service remains in use during peak periods. Drawing on survey data from 2022 and 2023, the chapter analyses user perceptions of the system. Results indicate strong student appreciation, particularly regarding stress reduction and equitable access to study spaces. Despite overall satisfaction, issues such as unoccupied reserved seats and an unnecessarily complex booking process emerged, leading to targeted improvements. This chapter highlights the importance of responsive, user-centred services in academic libraries. The adoption of the booking system helped address challenges such as overcrowding and "seat hogging," ultimately contributing to a more organised and accessible environment. The case study illustrates how technology can enhance library service delivery, offering insights for institutions seeking to optimise space management. The continued evaluation of the system reflects a broader commitment to adapting services in alignment with user needs and institutional priorities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Cross-Modal Fine-Tuning: Optimizing the Interaction between Feature Alignment and Target Fitting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18231</link><description>arXiv:2601.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting pre-trained models to unseen feature modalities has become increasingly important due to the growing need for cross-disciplinary knowledge integration.~A key challenge here is how to align the representation of new modalities with the most relevant parts of the pre-trained model's representation space to enable accurate knowledge transfer.~This requires combining feature alignment with target fine-tuning, but uncalibrated combinations can exacerbate misalignment between the source and target feature-label structures and reduce target generalization.~Existing work however lacks a theoretical understanding of this critical interaction between feature alignment and target fitting.~To bridge this gap, we develop a principled framework that establishes a provable generalization bound on the target error, which explains the interaction between feature alignment and target fitting through a novel concept of feature-label distortion.~This bound offers actionable insights into how this interaction should be optimized for practical algorithm design. The resulting approach achieves significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of benchmark datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Complex-Valued-Matrix Permanents: SPA-based Approximations and Double-Cover Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18232</link><description>arXiv:2601.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating the permanent of a complex-valued matrix is a fundamental problem with applications in Boson sampling and probabilistic inference. In this paper, we extend factor-graph-based methods for approximating the permanent of non-negative-real-valued matrices that are based on running the sum-product algorithm (SPA) on standard normal factor graphs, to factor-graph-based methods for approximating the permanent of complex-valued matrices that are based on running the SPA on double-edge normal factor graphs.
  On the algorithmic side, we investigate the behavior of the SPA, in particular how the SPA fixed points change when transitioning from real-valued to complex-valued matrix ensembles. On the analytical side, we use graph covers to analyze the Bethe approximation of the permanent, i.e., the approximation of the permanent that is obtained with the help of the SPA.
  This combined algorithmic and analytical perspective provides new insight into the structure of Bethe approximations in complex-valued problems and clarifies when such approximations remain meaningful beyond the non-negative-real-valued settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18232v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative AI in Saudi Arabia: A National Survey of Adoption, Risks, and Public Perceptions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18234</link><description>arXiv:2601.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly becoming embedded in Saudi Arabia's digital transformation under Vision 2030, yet public awareness, adoption, and concerns surrounding these tools remain underexplored. This study provides an early snapshot of GenAI engagement among Saudi nationals. Using a nationwide survey of 330 participants across regions, age groups, and employment sectors, we examine seven dimensions of GenAI use: awareness and understanding, adoption patterns, perceived impacts, training needs, risks and barriers, data-sharing behaviors, and future expectations. Findings show that 93% of respondents actively use GenAI primarily for text-based tasks, while more advanced uses such as programming or multimodal generation are less common. Despite the prevalence of use, overall awareness and conceptual understanding remain uneven, with many reporting limited technical knowledge. Participants recognize GenAI's benefits for productivity, work quality, and understanding complex information, yet caution that sustained reliance may undermine critical thinking and key professional skills. Trust in AI-generated outputs remains cautious, with widespread concerns about privacy, misinformation, and ethical misuse, including potential job displacement. Respondents show strong interest in structured GenAI training that combines foundational skills, domain-specific applications, and clear guidance on privacy, ethics, and responsible use. These results establish a baseline for GenAI engagement in Saudi Arabia and highlight priorities for policymakers and developers: expanding AI literacy, ensuring culturally and linguistically aligned GenAI solutions, and strengthening frameworks for privacy and responsible deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18234v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TechING: Towards Real World Technical Image Understanding via VLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18238</link><description>arXiv:2601.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Professionals working in technical domain typically hand-draw (on whiteboard, paper, etc.) technical diagrams (e.g., flowcharts, block diagrams, etc.) during discussions; however, if they want to edit these later, it needs to be drawn from scratch. Modern day VLMs have made tremendous progress in image understanding but they struggle when it comes to understanding technical diagrams. One way to overcome this problem is to fine-tune on real world hand-drawn images, but it is not practically possible to generate large number of such images. In this paper, we introduce a large synthetically generated corpus (reflective of real world images) for training VLMs and subsequently evaluate VLMs on a smaller corpus of hand-drawn images (with the help of humans). We introduce several new self-supervision tasks for training and perform extensive experiments with various baseline models and fine-tune Llama 3.2 11B-instruct model on synthetic images on these tasks to obtain LLama-VL-TUG, which significantly improves the ROUGE-L performance of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 2.14x and achieves the best all-round performance across all baseline models. On real-world images, human evaluation reveals that we achieve minimum compilation errors across all baselines in 7 out of 8 diagram types and improve the average F1 score of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 6.97x.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18238v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probing the Future of Meta-Analysis: Eliciting Design Principles via an Agentic Research IDE</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18239</link><description>arXiv:2601.18239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-analyses and systematic reviews demand rigorous abductive reasoning to build, test, and refine hypotheses across vast, heterogeneous literature. While NLP advancements have automated parts of this pipeline, existing tools often detach researchers from the cognitive loop or function merely as retrieval engines, leading to loss of intellectual ownership and frequent context switching. We present Research IDE, a prototype reimagining authoring environments through the "Research as Code" metaphor. Research IDE embeds a multi-agent backend into the writing flow, enabling in-situ verification via "hypothesis breakpoints." A one-week field deployment with 8 domain experts, followed by a reflective workshop, as a Research through Design (RtD) probe, reveals that users strongly preferred this verification workflow, actively leveraged prior knowledge for confirmation, and reported that breakpoints sparked insights. Drawing from participant feedback and suggestions, we derive design implications for future AI-assisted research tools that fully preserve researcher autonomy and intellectual ownership while harnessing computational scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18239v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] V-Loop: Visual Logical Loop Verification for Hallucination Detection in Medical Visual Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18240</link><description>arXiv:2601.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capability in assisting disease diagnosis in medical visual question answering (VQA). However, their outputs remain vulnerable to hallucinations (i.e., responses that contradict visual facts), posing significant risks in high-stakes medical scenarios. Recent introspective detection methods, particularly uncertainty-based approaches, offer computational efficiency but are fundamentally indirect, as they estimate predictive uncertainty for an image-question pair rather than verifying the factual correctness of a specific answer. To address this limitation, we propose Visual Logical Loop Verification (V-Loop), a training-free and plug-and-play framework for hallucination detection in medical VQA. V-Loop introduces a bidirectional reasoning process that forms a visually grounded logical loop to verify factual correctness. Given an input, the MLLM produces an answer for the primary input pair. V-Loop extracts semantic units from the primary QA pair, generates a verification question by conditioning on the answer unit to re-query the question unit, and enforces visual attention consistency to ensure answering both primary question and verification question rely on the same image evidence. If the verification answer matches the expected semantic content, the logical loop closes, indicating factual grounding; otherwise, the primary answer is flagged as hallucinated. Extensive experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks and MLLMs show that V-Loop consistently outperforms existing introspective methods, remains highly efficient, and further boosts uncertainty-based approaches when used in combination.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18240v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TAM-Eval: Evaluating LLMs for Automated Unit Test Maintenance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18241</link><description>arXiv:2601.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software engineering, their application to unit testing remains largely confined to isolated test generation or oracle prediction, neglecting the broader challenge of test suite maintenance. We introduce TAM-Eval (Test Automated Maintenance Evaluation), a framework and benchmark designed to evaluate model performance across three core test maintenance scenarios: creation, repair, and updating of test suites. Unlike prior work limited to function-level tasks, TAM-Eval operates at the test file level, while maintaining access to full repository context during isolated evaluation, better reflecting real-world maintenance workflows. Our benchmark comprises 1,539 automatically extracted and validated scenarios from Python, Java, and Go projects. TAM-Eval supports system-agnostic evaluation of both raw LLMs and agentic workflows, using a reference-free protocol based on test suite pass rate, code coverage, and mutation testing. Empirical results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs have limited capabilities in realistic test maintenance processes and yield only marginal improvements in test effectiveness. We release TAM-Eval as an open-source framework to support future research in automated software testing. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/trndcenter/TAM-Eval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18241v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vision-Language-Model-Guided Differentiable Ray Tracing for Fast and Accurate Multi-Material RF Parameter Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18242</link><description>arXiv:2601.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate radio-frequency (RF) material parameters are essential for electromagnetic digital twins in 6G systems, yet gradient-based inverse ray tracing (RT) remains sensitive to initialization and costly under limited measurements. This paper proposes a vision-language-model (VLM) guided framework that accelerates and stabilizes multi-material parameter estimation in a differentiable RT (DRT) engine. A VLM parses scene images to infer material categories and maps them to quantitative priors via an ITU-R material table, yielding informed conductivity initializations. The VLM further selects informative transmitter/receiver placements that promote diverse, material-discriminative paths. Starting from these priors, the DRT performs gradient-based refinement using measured received signal strengths. Experiments in NVIDIA Sionna on indoor scenes show 2-4$\times$ faster convergence and 10-100$\times$ lower final parameter error compared with uniform or random initialization and random placement baselines, achieving sub-0.1\% mean relative error with only a few receivers. Complexity analyses indicate per-iteration time scales near-linearly with the number of materials and measurement setups, while VLM-guided placement reduces the measurements required for accurate recovery. Ablations over RT depth and ray counts confirm further accuracy gains without significant per-iteration overhead. Results demonstrate that semantic priors from VLMs effectively guide physics-based optimization for fast and reliable RF material estimation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18242v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tractable Gaussian Phase Retrieval with Heavy Tails and Adversarial Corruption with Near-Linear Sample Complexity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18245</link><description>arXiv:2601.18245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase retrieval is the classical problem of recovering a signal $x^* \in \mathbb{R}^n$ from its noisy phaseless measurements $y_i = \langle a_i, x^* \rangle^2 + \zeta_i$ (where $\zeta_i$ denotes noise, and $a_i$ is the sensing vector) for $i \in [m]$. The problem of phase retrieval has a rich history, with a variety of applications such as optics, crystallography, heteroscedastic regression, astrophysics, etc. A major consideration in algorithms for phase retrieval is robustness against measurement errors. In recent breakthroughs in algorithmic robust statistics, efficient algorithms have been developed for several parameter estimation tasks such as mean estimation, covariance estimation, robust principal component analysis (PCA), etc. in the presence of heavy-tailed noise and adversarial corruptions. In this paper, we study efficient algorithms for robust phase retrieval with heavy-tailed noise when a constant fraction of both the measurements $y_i$ and the sensing vectors $a_i$ may be arbitrarily adversarially corrupted. For this problem, Buna and Rebeschini (AISTATS 2025) very recently gave an exponential time algorithm with sample complexity $O(n \log n)$. Their algorithm needs a robust spectral initialization, specifically, a robust estimate of the top eigenvector of a covariance matrix, which they deemed to be beyond known efficient algorithmic techniques (similar spectral initializations are a key ingredient of a large family of phase retrieval algorithms). In this work, we make a connection between robust spectral initialization and recent algorithmic advances in robust PCA, yielding the first polynomial-time algorithms for robust phase retrieval with both heavy-tailed noise and adversarial corruptions, in fact with near-linear (in $n$) sample complexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18245v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A multimodal vision foundation model for generalizable knee pathology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18250</link><description>arXiv:2601.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders represent a leading cause of global disability, creating an urgent demand for precise interpretation of medical imaging. Current artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in orthopedics predominantly rely on task-specific, supervised learning paradigms. These methods are inherently fragmented, require extensive annotated datasets, and often lack generalizability across different modalities and clinical scenarios. The development of foundation models in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, curated, and open-source musculoskeletal datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce OrthoFoundation, a multimodal vision foundation model optimized for musculoskeletal pathology. We constructed a pre-training dataset of 1.2 million unlabeled knee X-ray and MRI images from internal and public databases. Utilizing a Dinov3 backbone, the model was trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to capture robust radiological representations. OrthoFoundation achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across 14 downstream tasks. It attained superior accuracy in X-ray osteoarthritis diagnosis and ranked first in MRI structural injury detection. The model demonstrated remarkable label efficiency, matching supervised baselines using only 50% of labeled data. Furthermore, despite being pre-trained on knee images, OrthoFoundation exhibited exceptional cross-anatomy generalization to the hip, shoulder, and ankle. OrthoFoundation represents a significant advancement toward general-purpose AI for musculoskeletal imaging. By learning fundamental, joint-agnostic radiological semantics from large-scale multimodal data, it overcomes the limitations of conventional models, which provides a robust framework for reducing annotation burdens and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18250v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GenCI: Generative Modeling of User Interest Shift via Cohort-based Intent Learning for CTR Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18251</link><description>arXiv:2601.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays a pivotal role in online advertising and recommender systems. Despite notable progress in modeling user preferences from historical behaviors, two key challenges persist. First, exsiting discriminative paradigms focus on matching candidates to user history, often overfitting to historically dominant features and failing to adapt to rapid interest shifts. Second, a critical information chasm emerges from the point-wise ranking paradigm. By scoring each candidate in isolation, CTR models discard the rich contextual signal implied by the recalled set as a whole, leading to a misalignment where long-term preferences often override the user's immediate, evolving intent. To address these issues, we propose GenCI, a generative user intent framework that leverages semantic interest cohorts to model dynamic user preferences for CTR prediction. The framework first employs a generative model, trained with a next-item prediction (NTP) objective, to proactively produce candidate interest cohorts. These cohorts serve as explicit, candidate-agnostic representations of a user's immediate intent. A hierarchical candidate-aware network then injects this rich contextual signal into the ranking stage, refining them with cross-attention to align with both user history and the target item. The entire model is trained end-to-end, creating a more aligned and effective CTR prediction pipeline. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18251v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BoRP: Bootstrapped Regression Probing for Scalable and Human-Aligned LLM Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18253</link><description>arXiv:2601.18253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate evaluation of user satisfaction is critical for iterative development of conversational AI. However, for open-ended assistants, traditional A/B testing lacks reliable metrics: explicit feedback is sparse, while implicit metrics are ambiguous. To bridge this gap, we introduce BoRP (Bootstrapped Regression Probing), a scalable framework for high-fidelity satisfaction evaluation. Unlike generative approaches, BoRP leverages the geometric properties of LLM latent space. It employs a polarization-index-based bootstrapping mechanism to automate rubric generation and utilizes Partial Least Squares (PLS) to map hidden states to continuous scores. Experiments on industrial datasets show that BoRP (Qwen3-8B/14B) significantly outperforms generative baselines (even Qwen3-Max) in alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, BoRP reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude, enabling full-scale monitoring and highly sensitive A/B testing via CUPED.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18253v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Retention: Orchestrating Structural Safety and Plasticity in Continual Learning for LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18255</link><description>arXiv:2601.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) faces the critical challenge of balancing stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (learning new tasks). While Experience Replay (ER) is a standard countermeasure against catastrophic forgetting, its impact across diverse capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we uncover a critical dichotomy in ER's behavior: while it induces positive backward transfer on robust, unstructured tasks (e.g., boosting performance on previous NLP classification tasks through repeated rehearsal), it causes severe negative transfer on fragile, structured domains like code generation (e.g., a significant relative drop in coding accuracy). This reveals that ER trades structural integrity for broad consolidation. To address this dilemma, we propose \textbf{Orthogonal Subspace Wake-up (OSW)}. OSW identifies essential parameter subspaces of previous tasks via a brief "wake-up" phase and enforces orthogonal updates for new tasks, providing a mathematically grounded "safety guarantee" for established knowledge structures. Empirical results across a diverse four-task sequence demonstrate that OSW uniquely succeeds in preserving fragile coding abilities where Replay fails, while simultaneously maintaining high plasticity for novel tasks. Our findings emphasize the necessity of evaluating structural safety alongside average retention in LLM continual learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18255v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Depth to Anatomy: Learning Internal Organ Locations from Surface Depth Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18260</link><description>arXiv:2601.18260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated patient positioning plays an important role in optimizing scanning procedure and improving patient throughput.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting impairs the continuous learning of large language models.

FGGM dynamically generates binary masks with adaptive thresholds, preserving critical parameters to balance stability and plasticity without requiring historical data. Unlike magnitude-based methods such as MIGU, our approach offers a mathematically principled parameter importance estimation. On the TRACE benchmark, FGGM shows a 9.6% relative improvement in retaining general capabilities over supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a 4.4% improvement over MIGU on TRACE tasks. Additional analysis on code generation tasks confirms FGGM's superior performance and reduced forgetting, establishing it as an effective solution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18261v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Aerial Scene Classification on the AID Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18263</link><description>arXiv:2601.18263v1 Announce Type: new

In this connection, we have also designed Aerial-Y-Net, a spatial attention-enhanced CNN with multi-scale feature fusion mechanism, which acts as an attention-based model and helps us to better understand the complexities of aerial images. Evaluated on the AID dataset, our model achieves 91.72% accuracy, outperforming several baseline architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18263v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Network Approximation: A View from Polytope Decomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18264</link><description>arXiv:2601.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal approximation theory offers a foundational framework to verify neural network expressiveness, enabling principled utilization in real-world applications. However, most existing theoretical constructions are established by uniformly dividing the input space into tiny hypercubes without considering the local regularity of the target function. In this work, we investigate the universal approximation capabilities of ReLU networks from a view of polytope decomposition, which offers a more realistic and task-oriented approach compared to current methods. To achieve this, we develop an explicit kernel polynomial method to derive an universal approximation of continuous functions, which is characterized not only by the refined Totik-Ditzian-type modulus of continuity, but also by polytopical domain decomposition. Then, a ReLU network is constructed to approximate the kernel polynomial in each subdomain separately. Furthermore, we find that polytope decomposition makes our approximation more efficient and flexible than existing methods in many cases, especially near singular points of the objective function. Lastly, we extend our approach to analytic functions to reach a higher approximation rate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18264v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Orchestrating Specialized Agents for Trustworthy Enterprise RAG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18267</link><description>arXiv:2601.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows promise for enterprise knowledge work, yet it often underperforms in high-stakes decision settings that require deep synthesis, strict traceability, and recovery from underspecified prompts. One-pass retrieval-and-write pipelines frequently yield shallow summaries, inconsistent grounding, and weak mechanisms for completeness verification. We introduce ADORE (Adaptive Deep Orchestration for Research in Enterprise), an agentic framework that replaces linear retrieval with iterative, user-steered investigation coordinated by a central orchestrator and a set of specialized agents. ADORE's key insight is that a structured Memory Bank (a curated evidence store with explicit claim-evidence linkage and section-level admissible evidence) enables traceable report generation and systematic checks for evidence completeness. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Memory-locked synthesis - report generation is constrained to a structured Memory Bank (Claim-Evidence Graph) with section-level admissible evidence, enabling traceable claims and grounded citations; (2) Evidence-coverage-guided execution - a retrieval-reflection loop audits section-level evidence coverage to trigger targeted follow-up retrieval and terminates via an evidence-driven stopping criterion; (3) Section-packed long-context grounding - section-level packing, pruning, and citation-preserving compression make long-form synthesis feasible under context limits. Across our evaluation suite, ADORE ranks first on DeepResearch Bench (52.65) and achieves the highest head-to-head preference win rate on DeepConsult (77.2%) against commercial systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18267v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Designing large language model prompts to extract scores from messy text: A shared dataset and challenge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18271</link><description>arXiv:2601.18271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some areas of computing, natural language processing and information science, progress is made by sharing datasets and challenging the community to design the best algorithm for an associated task. This article introduces a shared dataset of 1446 short texts, each of which describes a research quality score on the UK scale of 1* to 4*. This is a messy collection, with some texts not containing scores and others including invalid scores or strange formats. With this dataset there is also a description of what constitutes a valid score and a "gold standard" of the correct scores for these texts (including missing values). The challenge is to design a prompt for Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the scores from these texts as accurately as possible. The format for the response should be a number and no other text so there are two aspects to the challenge: ensuring that the LLM returns only a number, and instructing it to deduce the correct number for the text. As part of this, the LLM prompt needs to explain when to return the missing value code, -1, instead of a number when the text does not clearly contain one. The article also provides an example of a simple prompt. The purpose of the challenge is twofold: to get an effective solution to this problem, and to increase understanding of prompt design and LLM capabilities for complex numerical tasks. The initial solution suggested has an accuracy of 72.6%, so the challenge is to beat this.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18271v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TEFormer: Structured Bidirectional Temporal Enhancement Modeling in Spiking Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18274</link><description>arXiv:2601.18274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Spiking Transformers emerging as a promising architecture for energy-efficient sequence modeling. However, existing Spiking Transformers still lack a principled mechanism for effective temporal fusion, limiting their ability to fully exploit spatiotemporal dependencies. Inspired by feedforward-feedback modulation in the human visual pathway, we propose TEFormer, the first Spiking Transformer framework that achieves bidirectional temporal fusion by decoupling temporal modeling across its core components. Specifically, TEFormer employs a lightweight and hyperparameter-free forward temporal fusion mechanism in the attention module, enabling fully parallel computation, while incorporating a backward gated recurrent structure in the MLP to aggregate temporal information in reverse order and reinforce temporal consistency. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that TEFormer consistently and significantly outperforms strong SNN and Spiking Transformer baselines under diverse datasets. Moreover, through the first systematic evaluation of Spiking Transformers under different neural encoding schemes, we show that the performance gains of TEFormer remain stable across encoding choices, indicating that the improved temporal modeling directly translates into reliable accuracy improvements across varied spiking representations. These results collectively establish TEFormer as an effective and general framework for temporal modeling in Spiking Transformers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18274v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Nobody Around Is Real: Exploring Public Opinions and User Experiences On the Multi-Agent AI Social Platform</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18275</link><description>arXiv:2601.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powered by large language models, a new genre of multi-agent social platforms has emerged. Apps such as Social.AI deploy numerous AI agents that emulate human behavior, creating unprecedented bot-centric social networks. Yet, existing research has predominantly focused on one-on-one chatbots, leaving multi-agent AI platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we took Social.AI as a case study and performed a two-stage investigation: (i) content analysis of 883 user comments; (ii) a 7-day diary study with 20 participants to document their firsthand platform experiences. While public discourse expressed greater skepticism, the diary study found that users did project a range of social expectations onto the AI agents. While some user expectations were met, the AI-dominant social environment introduces distinct problems, such as attention overload and homogenized interaction. These tensions signal a future where AI functions not merely as a tool or an anthropomorphized actor, but as the dominant medium of sociality itself-a paradigm shift that foregrounds new forms of architected social life.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18275v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Do Learned Models Measure?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18278</link><description>arXiv:2601.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many scientific and data-driven applications, machine learning models are increasingly used as measurement instruments, rather than merely as predictors of predefined labels. When the measurement function is learned from data, the mapping from observations to quantities is determined implicitly by the training distribution and inductive biases, allowing multiple inequivalent mappings to satisfy standard predictive evaluation criteria. We formalize learned measurement functions as a distinct focus of evaluation and introduce measurement stability, a property capturing invariance of the measured quantity across admissible realizations of the learning process and across contexts. We show that standard evaluation criteria in machine learning, including generalization error, calibration, and robustness, do not guarantee measurement stability. Through a real-world case study, we show that models with comparable predictive performance can implement systematically inequivalent measurement functions, with distribution shift providing a concrete illustration of this failure. Taken together, our results highlight a limitation of existing evaluation frameworks in settings where learned model outputs are identified as measurements, motivating the need for an additional evaluative dimension.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18278v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reflecting Twice before Speaking with Empathy: Self-Reflective Alternating Inference for Empathy-Aware End-to-End Spoken Dialogue</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18281</link><description>arXiv:2601.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end Spoken Language Models (SLMs) hold great potential for paralinguistic perception, and numerous studies have aimed to enhance their capabilities, particularly for empathetic dialogue. However, current approaches largely depend on rigid supervised signals, such as ground-truth response in supervised fine-tuning or preference scores in reinforcement learning. Such reliance is fundamentally limited for modeling complex empathy, as there is no single "correct" response and a simple numerical score cannot fully capture the nuances of emotional expression or the appropriateness of empathetic behavior. To address these limitations, we sequentially introduce EmpathyEval, a descriptive natural-language-based evaluation model for assessing empathetic quality in spoken dialogues. Building upon EmpathyEval, we propose ReEmpathy, an end-to-end SLM that enhances empathetic dialogue through a novel Empathetic Self-Reflective Alternating Inference mechanism, which interleaves spoken response generation with free-form, empathy-related reflective reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReEmpathy substantially improves empathy-sensitive spoken dialogue by enabling reflective reasoning, offering a promising approach toward more emotionally intelligent and empathy-aware human-computer interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18281v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Think-Augmented Function Calling: Improving LLM Parameter Accuracy Through Embedded Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18282</link><description>arXiv:2601.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in function calling for autonomous agents, yet current mechanisms lack explicit reasoning transparency during parameter generation, particularly for complex functions with interdependent parameters. While existing approaches like chain-of-thought prompting operate at the agent level, they fail to provide fine-grained reasoning guidance for individual function parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Think-Augmented Function Calling (TAFC), a novel framework that enhances function calling accuracy through explicit reasoning at both function and parameter levels. Our method introduces a universal "think" parameter augmentation that enables models to articulate their decision-making process, with dynamic optimization for parameter descriptions to improve reasoning quality. For complex parameters, TAFC automatically triggers granular reasoning based on complexity scoring, ensuring appropriate justification for critical decisions. Additionally, we propose reasoning-guided optimization to align generated reasoning with human expectations. TAFC requires no architectural modifications to existing LLMs while maintaining full API compatibility. Evaluation on ToolBench across proprietary and open-source models demonstrates significant improvements in parameter generation accuracy and reasoning coherence for multi-parameter functions, while providing enhanced interpretability for debugging AI agent behaviors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18282v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VissimRL: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control Based on Vissim</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18284</link><description>arXiv:2601.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a major challenge for urban transportation, leading to significant economic and environmental impacts. Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is one of the key measures to mitigate congestion, and recent studies have increasingly applied Reinforcement Learning (RL) for its adaptive capabilities. With respect to SUMO and CityFlow, the simulator Vissim offers high-fidelity driver behavior modeling and wide industrial adoption but remains underutilized in RL research due to its complex interface and lack of standardized frameworks. To address this gap, this paper proposes VissimRL, a modular RL framework for TSC that encapsulates Vissim's COM interface through a high-level Python API, offering standardized environments for both single- and multi-agent training. Experiments show that VissimRL significantly reduces development effort while maintaining runtime efficiency, and supports consistent improvements in traffic performance during training, as well as emergent coordination in multi-agent control. Overall, VissimRL demonstrates the feasibility of applying RL in high-fidelity simulations and serves as a bridge between academic research and practical applications in intelligent traffic signal control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] U-Fold: Dynamic Intent-Aware Context Folding for User-Centric Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18285</link><description>arXiv:2601.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have been successfully deployed in many tool-augmented settings, but their scalability is fundamentally constrained by context length. Existing context-folding methods mitigate this issue by summarizing past interactions, yet they are typically designed for single-query or single-intent scenarios. In more realistic user-centric dialogues, we identify two major failure modes: (i) they irreversibly discard fine-grained constraints and intermediate facts that are crucial for later decisions, and (ii) their summaries fail to track evolving user intent, leading to omissions and erroneous actions. To address these limitations, we propose U-Fold, a dynamic context-folding framework tailored to user-centric tasks. U-Fold retains the full user--agent dialogue and tool-call history but, at each turn, uses two core components to produce an intent-aware, evolving dialogue summary and a compact, task-relevant tool log. Extensive experiments on $\tau$-bench, $\tau^2$-bench, VitaBench, and harder context-inflated settings show that U-Fold consistently outperforms ReAct (achieving a 71.4% win rate in long-context settings) and prior folding baselines (with improvements of up to 27.0%), particularly on long, noisy, multi-turn tasks. Our study demonstrates that U-Fold is a promising step toward transferring context-management techniques from single-query benchmarks to realistic user-centric applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TriPlay-RL: Tri-Role Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for LLM Safety Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18292</link><description>arXiv:2601.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, safety risks associated with large language models have become increasingly prominent, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate the generation of toxic and harmful content. The mainstream paradigm for LLM safety alignment typically adopts a collaborative framework involving three roles: an attacker for adversarial prompt generation, a defender for safety defense, and an evaluator for response assessment. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop reinforcement learning framework called TriPlay-RL that enables iterative and co-improving collaboration among three roles with near-zero manual annotation. Experimental results show that the attacker preserves high output diversity while achieving a 20%-50% improvement in adversarial effectiveness; the defender attains 10%-30% gains in safety performance without degrading general reasoning capability; and the evaluator continuously refines its fine-grained judgment ability through iterations, accurately distinguishing unsafe responses, simple refusals, and useful guidance. Overall, our framework establishes an efficient and scalable paradigm for LLM safety alignment, enabling continuous co-evolution within a unified learning loop.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18292v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Learning with Distributed MPC for Fuel-Efficient Platoon Control with Discrete Gear Transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18294</link><description>arXiv:2601.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative control of groups of autonomous vehicles (AVs), i.e., platoons, is a promising direction to improving the efficiency of autonomous transportation systems. In this context, distributed co-optimization of both vehicle speed and gear position can offer benefits for fuel-efficient driving. To this end, model predictive control (MPC) is a popular approach, optimizing the speed and gear-shift schedule while explicitly considering the vehicles' dynamics over a prediction window. However, optimization over both the vehicles' continuous dynamics and discrete gear positions is computationally intensive, and may require overly long sample times or high-end hardware for real-time implementation. This work proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distributed MPC approach to address this issue. For each vehicle in the platoon, a policy is trained to select and fix the gear positions across the prediction window of a local MPC controller, leaving a significantly simpler continuous optimization problem to be solved as part of a distributed MPC scheme. In order to reduce the computational cost of training and facilitate the scalability of the proposed approach to large platoons, the policies are parameterized such that the emergent multi-agent RL problem can be decoupled into single-agent learning tasks. In addition, a recurrent neural-network (RNN) architecture is proposed for the gear selection policy, such that the learning is scalable even as the number of possible gear-shift schedules grows exponentially with the MPC prediction horizon. In highway-driving simulations, the proposed approach is shown to have a significantly lower computation burden and a comparable performance in terms of fuel-efficient platoon control, with respect to pure MPC-based co-optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18294v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Temp-R1: A Unified Autonomous Agent for Complex Temporal KGQA via Reverse Curriculum Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18296</link><description>arXiv:2601.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) is inherently challenging, as it requires sophisticated reasoning over dynamic facts with multi-hop dependencies and complex temporal constraints. Existing methods rely on fixed workflows and expensive closed-source APIs, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose Temp-R1, the first autonomous end-to-end agent for TKGQA trained through reinforcement learning. To address cognitive overload in single-action reasoning, we expand the action space with specialized internal actions alongside external action. To prevent shortcut learning on simple questions, we introduce reverse curriculum learning that trains on difficult questions first, forcing the development of sophisticated reasoning before transferring to easier cases. Our 8B-parameter Temp-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA, improving 19.8% over strong baselines on complex questions. Our work establishes a new paradigm for autonomous temporal reasoning agents.

Abstract: Simulation techniques such as the finite element method are essential for designing electrical devices, but their computational cost can be prohibitive for repeated or real-time computations.

In this work, Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is combined with proper orthogonal decomposition and Gaussian process regression to construct a non-intrusive surrogate model of a parametric nonlinear model of a permanent magnet synchronous machine. The differentiable nature of IGA allows for computationally efficient extraction of parametric sensitivities, which are leveraged for gradient-enhanced surrogate modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18300v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Contextual Range-View Projection for 3D LiDAR Point Clouds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18301</link><description>arXiv:2601.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Range-view projection provides an efficient method for transforming 3D LiDAR point clouds into 2D range image representations, enabling effective processing with 2D deep learning models. However, a major challenge in this projection is the many-to-one conflict, where multiple 3D points are mapped onto the same pixel in the range image, requiring a selection strategy. Existing approaches typically retain the point with the smallest depth (closest to the LiDAR), disregarding semantic relevance and object structure, which leads to the loss of important contextual information. In this paper, we extend the depth-based selection rule by incorporating contextual information from both instance centers and class labels, introducing two mechanisms: \textit{Centerness-Aware Projection (CAP)} and \textit{Class-Weighted-Aware Projection (CWAP)}. In CAP, point depths are adjusted according to their distance from the instance center, thereby prioritizing central instance points over noisy boundary and background points. In CWAP, object classes are prioritized through user-defined weights, offering flexibility in the projection strategy. Our evaluations on the SemanticKITTI dataset show that CAP preserves more instance points during projection, achieving up to a 3.1\% mIoU improvement compared to the baseline. Furthermore, CWAP enhances the performance of targeted classes while having a negligible impact on the performance of other classes</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18301v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Suppressing Final Layer Hidden State Jumps in Transformer Pretraining</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18302</link><description>arXiv:2601.18302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the internal behavior of Transformer language models. Many recent pre-trained models have been reported to exhibit only slight changes in the angular distance between the input and output hidden state vectors in the middle Transformer layers, despite a disproportionately large ``jump'' in the angular distance occurring in or around the final Transformer layer. To characterize this, we first introduce a quantitative metric for the jump strength around the final layer, and then demonstrate its prevalence across many open-weight models, as well as its amplification throughout pre-training. Assuming such jumps indicate an undesirable property, we propose the jump-suppressing regularizer (JREG) which penalizes this jump during pre-training, thereby encouraging more balanced capability usage across the middle layers. Empirical evaluations of three model sizes of Llama-based models, trained with the proposed JREG method, reveal improved task performance compared to the baseline without altering the model architecture.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18302v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SwipeGen: Bridging the Execution Gap in GUI Agents via Human-like Swipe Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18305</link><description>arXiv:2601.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents for automating GUI interaction tasks, substantial research focused on improving GUI perception to ground task instructions into concrete action steps. However, the step execution capability of these agents has gradually emerged as a new bottleneck for task completion. In particular, existing GUI agents often adopt overly simplified strategies for handling swipe interactions, preventing them from accurately replicating human-like behavior. To address this limitation, we decompose human swipe gestures into multiple quantifiable dimensions and propose an automated pipeline SwipeGen to synthesize human-like swipe interactions through GUI exploration. Based on this pipeline, we construct and release the first benchmark for evaluating the swipe execution capability of GUI agents. Furthermore, leveraging the synthesized data, we propose GUISwiper, a GUI agent with enhanced interaction execution capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that GUISwiper achieves a swipe execution accuracy of 69.07%, representing a 214% improvement over existing VLM baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18305v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Calibrating Beyond English: Language Diversity for Better Quantized Multilingual LLM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18306</link><description>arXiv:2601.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique for reducing the storage footprint and computational costs of Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often results in performance degradation. Existing post-training quantization methods typically use small, English-only calibration sets; however, their impact on multilingual models remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate eight calibration settings (five single-language and three multilingual mixes) on two quantizers (GPTQ, AWQ) on data from 10 languages. Our findings reveal a consistent trend: non-English and multilingual calibration sets significantly improve perplexity compared to English-only baselines. Specifically, we observe notable average perplexity gains across both quantizers on Llama3.1 8B and Qwen2.5 7B, with multilingual mixes achieving the largest overall reductions of up to 3.52 points in perplexity. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that tailoring calibration sets to the evaluation language yields the largest improvements for individual languages, underscoring the importance of linguistic alignment. We also identify specific failure cases where certain language-quantizer combinations degrade performance, which we trace to differences in activation range distributions across languages. These results highlight that static one-size-fits-all calibration is suboptimal and that tailoring calibration data, both in language and diversity, plays a crucial role in robustly quantizing multilingual LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18306v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Generative AI-Driven Reliability Layer for Action-Oriented Disaster Resilience</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18308</link><description>arXiv:2601.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As climate-related hazards intensify, conventional early warning systems (EWS) disseminate alerts rapidly but often fail to trigger timely protective actions, leading to preventable losses and inequities.

Evaluation through simulations, user studies, and a municipal pilot shows improved outcomes, including higher protective action execution, reduced response latency, and increased usability and trust. By combining predictive analytics, behavioral science, and responsible AI, Climate RADAR advances people-centered, transparent, and equitable early warning systems, offering practical pathways toward compliance-ready disaster resilience infrastructures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18308v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Convex Chance-Constrained Stochastic Control under Uncertain Specifications with Application to Learning-Based Hybrid Powertrain Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18313</link><description>arXiv:2601.18313v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into wireless networks presents significant potential for automating system design. However, unlike conventional throughput maximization, Covert Communication (CC) requires optimizing transmission utility under strict detection-theoretic constraints, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence limits. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on general reasoning or standard communication tasks and do not adequately evaluate the ability of LLMs to satisfy these rigorous security constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CovertComBench, a unified benchmark designed to assess LLM capabilities across the CC pipeline, encompassing conceptual understanding (MCQs), optimization derivation (ODQs), and code generation (CGQs). Furthermore, we analyze the reliability of automated scoring within a detection-theoretic ``LLM-as-Judge'' framework. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art models reveal a significant performance discrepancy. While LLMs achieve high accuracy in conceptual identification (81%) and code implementation (83%), their performance in the higher-order mathematical derivations necessary for security guarantees ranges between 18% and 55%. This limitation indicates that current LLMs serve better as implementation assistants rather than autonomous solvers for security-constrained optimization. These findings suggest that future research should focus on external tool augmentation to build trustworthy wireless AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18315v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MultiVis-Agent: A Multi-Agent Framework with Logic Rules for Reliable and Comprehensive Cross-Modal Data Visualization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18320</link><description>arXiv:2601.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world visualization tasks involve complex, multi-modal requirements that extend beyond simple text-to-chart generation, requiring reference images, code examples, and iterative refinement. Current systems exhibit fundamental limitations: single-modality input, one-shot generation, and rigid workflows. While LLM-based approaches show potential for these complex requirements, they introduce reliability challenges including catastrophic failures and infinite loop susceptibility. To address this gap, we propose MultiVis-Agent, a logic rule-enhanced multi-agent framework for reliable multi-modal and multi-scenario visualization generation. Our approach introduces a four-layer logic rule framework that provides mathematical guarantees for system reliability while maintaining flexibility. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, our logic rules are mathematical constraints that guide LLM reasoning rather than replacing it. We formalize the MultiVis task spanning four scenarios from basic generation to iterative refinement, and develop MultiVis-Bench, a benchmark with over 1,000 cases for multi-modal visualization evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves 75.63% visualization score on challenging tasks, significantly outperforming baselines (57.54-62.79%), with task completion rates of 99.58% and code execution success rates of 94.56% (vs. 74.48% and 65.10% without logic rules), successfully addressing both complexity and reliability challenges in automated visualization generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18320v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Integrating Fine-Grained Audio-Visual Evidence for Robust Multimodal Emotion Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18321</link><description>arXiv:2601.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion analysis is shifting from static classification to generative reasoning. Beyond simple label prediction, robust affective reasoning must synthesize fine-grained signals such as facial micro-expressions and prosodic which shifts to decode the latent causality within complex social contexts. However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face significant limitations in fine-grained perception, primarily due to data scarcity and insufficient cross-modal fusion. As a result, these models often exhibit unimodal dominance which leads to hallucinations in complex multimodal interactions, particularly when visual and acoustic cues are subtle, ambiguous, or even contradictory (e.g., in sarcastic scenery). To address this, we introduce SABER-LLM, a framework designed for robust multimodal reasoning. First, we construct SABER, a large-scale emotion reasoning dataset comprising 600K video clips, annotated with a novel six-dimensional schema that jointly captures audiovisual cues and causal logic. Second, we propose the structured evidence decomposition paradigm, which enforces a "perceive-then-reason" separation between evidence extraction and reasoning to alleviate unimodal dominance. The ability to perceive complex scenes is further reinforced by consistency-aware direct preference optimization, which explicitly encourages alignment among modalities under ambiguous or conflicting perceptual conditions. Experiments on EMER, EmoBench-M, and SABER-Test demonstrate that SABER-LLM significantly outperforms open-source baselines and achieves robustness competitive with closed-source models in decoding complex emotional dynamics. The dataset and model are available at https://github.com/zxzhao0/SABER-LLM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18321v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TC-IDM: Grounding Video Generation for Executable Zero-shot Robot Motion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18323</link><description>arXiv:2601.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm has enabled powerful robotic control by leveraging vision-language models, but its reliance on large-scale, high-quality robot data limits its generalization. Generative world models offer a promising alternative for general-purpose embodied AI, yet a critical gap remains between their pixel-level plans and physically executable actions.
  To this end, we propose the Tool-Centric Inverse Dynamics Model (TC-IDM). By focusing on the tool's imagined trajectory as synthesized by the world model, TC-IDM establishes a robust intermediate representation that bridges the gap between visual planning and physical control.
  TC-IDM extracts the tool's point cloud trajectories via segmentation and 3D motion estimation from generated videos. Considering diverse tool attributes, our architecture employs decoupled action heads to project these planned trajectories into 6-DoF end-effector motions and corresponding control signals.
  This plan-and-translate paradigm not only supports a wide range of end-effectors but also significantly improves viewpoint invariance. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities across long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks, including interacting with deformable objects.
  In real-world evaluations, the world model with TC-IDM achieves an average success rate of 61.11 percent, with 77.7 percent on simple tasks and 38.46 percent on zero-shot deformable object tasks. It substantially outperforms end-to-end VLA-style baselines and other inverse dynamics models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18323v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cognitive Fusion of ZC Sequences and Time-Frequency Images for Out-of-Distribution Detection of Drone Signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18326</link><description>arXiv:2601.18326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a drone signal out-of-distribution detection (OODD) algorithm based on the cognitive fusion of Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences and time-frequency images (TFI). ZC sequences are identified by analyzing the communication protocols of DJI drones, while TFI capture the time-frequency characteristics of drone signals with unknown or non-standard communication protocols. Both modalities are used jointly to enable OODD in the drone remote identification (RID) task. Specifically, ZC sequence features and TFI features are generated from the received radio frequency signals, which are then processed through dedicated feature extraction module to enhance and align them. The resultant multi-modal features undergo multi-modal feature interaction, single-modal feature fusion, and multi-modal feature fusion to produce features that integrate and complement information across modalities. Discrimination scores are computed from the fused features along both spatial and channel dimensions to capture time-frequency characteristic differences dictated by the communication protocols, and these scores will be transformed into adaptive attention weights. The weighted features are then passed through a Softmax function to produce the signal classification results. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms and achieves 1.7% and 7.5% improvements in RID and OODD metrics, respectively. The proposed algorithm also performs strong robustness under varying flight conditions and across different drone types.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MarioChart: Autonomous Tangibles as Active Proxy Interfaces for Embodied Casual Data Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18328</link><description>arXiv:2601.18328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of an Active Proxy interface, i.e. tangible models as proxies for physical data referents, supporting interactive exploration of data through active manipulation. We realise an active proxy data visualisation system, "MarioChart", using robot carts relocating themselves on a tabletop, e.g., to align with their data referents in a map or other visual layout. We consider a casual-data exploration scenario involving a multivariate campus sustainability dataset, using scale models as proxies for their physical building data referents. Our empirical study (n=12) compares active proxy use with conventional tablet interaction, finding that our active proxy system enhances short-term spatial memory of data and enables faster completion of certain data analytic tasks. It shows no significant differences compared to traditional touch-screens in long-term memory, physical fatigue, mental workload, or user engagement. Our study offers an initial baseline for active proxy techniques and advances understanding of tangible interfaces in situated data visualisation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18328v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Discriminability-Driven Spatial-Channel Selection with Gradient Norm for Drone Signal OOD Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18329</link><description>arXiv:2601.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a drone signal out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithm based on discriminability-driven spatial-channel selection with a gradient norm. Time-frequency image features are adaptively weighted along both spatial and channel dimensions by quantifying inter-class similarity and variance based on protocol-specific time-frequency characteristics. Subsequently, a gradient-norm metric is introduced to measure perturbation sensitivity for capturing the inherent instability of OOD samples, which is then fused with energy-based scores for joint inference. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides superior discriminative power and robust performance via SNR and various drone types.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18329v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Tumor Aware DenseNet Swin Hybrid Learning with Boosted and Hierarchical Feature Spaces for Large-Scale Brain MRI Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18330</link><description>arXiv:2601.18330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an efficient Densely Swin Hybrid (EDSH) framework for brain tumor MRI analysis, designed to jointly capture fine grained texture patterns and long range contextual dependencies. Two tumor aware experimental setups are introduced to address class-specific diagnostic challenges. The first setup employs a Boosted Feature Space (BFS), where independently customized DenseNet and Swint branches learn complementary local and global representations that are dimension aligned, fused, and boosted, enabling highly sensitive detection of diffuse glioma patterns by successfully learning the features of irregular shape, poorly defined mass, and heterogeneous texture. The second setup adopts a hierarchical DenseNet Swint architecture with Deep Feature Extraction have Dual Residual connections (DFE and DR), in which DenseNet serves as a stem CNN for structured local feature learning, while Swin_t models global tumor morphology, effectively suppressing false negatives in meningioma and pituitary tumor classification by learning the features of well defined mass, location (outside brain) and enlargments in tumors (dural tail or upward extension). DenseNet is customized at the input level to match MRI spatial characteristics, leveraging dense residual connectivity to preserve texture information and mitigate vanishing-gradient effects. In parallel, Swint is tailored through task aligned patch embedding and shifted-window self attention to efficiently capture hierarchical global dependencies. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale MRI dataset (stringent 40,260 images across four tumor classes) demonstrates consistent superiority over standalone CNNs, Vision Transformers, and hybrids, achieving 98.50 accuracy and recall on the test unseen dataset.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18330v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Overalignment in Frontier LLMs: An Empirical Study of Sycophantic Behaviour in Healthcare</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18334</link><description>arXiv:2601.18334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, their tendency for sycophancy, prioritizing user agreement over factual accuracy, poses significant risks to patient safety. While existing evaluations often rely on subjective datasets, we introduce a robust framework grounded in medical MCQA with verifiable ground truths. We propose the Adjusted Sycophancy Score, a novel metric that isolates alignment bias by accounting for stochastic model instability, or "confusability". Through an extensive scaling analysis of the Qwen-3 and Llama-3 families, we identify a clear scaling trajectory for resilience. Furthermore, we reveal a counter-intuitive vulnerability in reasoning-optimized "Thinking" models: while they demonstrate high vanilla accuracy, their internal reasoning traces frequently rationalize incorrect user suggestions under authoritative pressure. Our results across frontier models suggest that benchmark performance is not a proxy for clinical reliability, and that simplified reasoning structures may offer superior robustness against expert-driven sycophancy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analytic Incremental Learning For Sound Source Localization With Imbalance Rectification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18335</link><description>arXiv:2601.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) demonstrates remarkable results in controlled settings but struggles in real-world deployment due to dual imbalance challenges: intra-task imbalance arising from long-tailed direction-of-arrival (DoA) distributions, and inter-task imbalance induced by cross-task skews and overlaps. These often lead to catastrophic forgetting, significantly degrading the localization accuracy. To mitigate these issues, we propose a unified framework with two key innovations. Specifically, we design a GCC-PHAT-based data augmentation (GDA) method that leverages peak characteristics to alleviate intra-task distribution skews. We also propose an Analytic dynamic imbalance rectifier (ADIR) with task-adaption regularization, which enables analytic updates that adapt to inter-task dynamics. On the SSLR benchmark, our proposal achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results of 89.0% accuracy, 5.3{\deg} mean absolute error, and 1.6 backward transfer, demonstrating robustness to evolving imbalances without exemplar storage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18335v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PPISP: Physically-Plausible Compensation and Control of Photometric Variations in Radiance Field Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18336</link><description>arXiv:2601.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction methods remain highly sensitive to photometric inconsistencies arising from camera optical characteristics and variations in image signal processing (ISP). Existing mitigation strategies such as per-frame latent variables or affine color corrections lack physical grounding and generalize poorly to novel views. We propose the Physically-Plausible ISP (PPISP) correction module, which disentangles camera-intrinsic and capture-dependent effects through physically based and interpretable transformations. A dedicated PPISP controller, trained on the input views, predicts ISP parameters for novel viewpoints, analogous to auto exposure and auto white balance in real cameras. This design enables realistic and fair evaluation on novel views without access to ground-truth images. PPISP achieves SoTA performance on standard benchmarks, while providing intuitive control and supporting the integration of metadata when available.

Abstract: The Complete Vocal Technique (CVT) is a school of singing developed in the past decades by Cathrin Sadolin et al.. CVT groups the use of the voice into so called vocal modes, namely Neutral, Curbing, Overdrive and Edge. Knowledge of the desired vocal mode can be helpful for singing students. Automatic classification of vocal modes can thus be important for technology-assisted singing teaching. Previously, automatic classification of vocal modes has been attempted without major success, potentially due to a lack of data. Therefore, we recorded a novel vocal mode dataset consisting of sustained vowels recorded from four singers, three of which professional singers with more than five years of CVT-experience. The dataset covers the entire vocal range of the subjects, totaling 3,752 unique samples. By using four microphones, thereby offering a natural data augmentation, the dataset consists of more than 13,000 samples combined. An annotation was created using three CVT-experienced annotators, each providing an individual annotation. The merged annotation as well as the three individual annotations come with the published dataset. Additionally, we provide some baseline classification results. The best balanced accuracy across a 5-fold cross validation of 81.3\,\% was achieved with a ResNet18. The dataset can be downloaded under https://zenodo.org/records/14276415.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18339v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Rigid: Benchmarking Non-Rigid Video Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18340</link><description>arXiv:2601.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in text-driven video editing, generating coherent non-rigid deformations remains a critical challenge, often plagued by physical distortion and temporal flicker. To bridge this gap, we propose NRVBench, the first dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate non-rigid video editing. First, we curate a high-quality dataset consisting of 180 non-rigid motion videos from six physics-based categories, equipped with 2,340 fine-grained task instructions and 360 multiple-choice questions. Second, we propose NRVE-Acc, a novel evaluation metric based on Vision-Language Models that can rigorously assess physical compliance, temporal consistency, and instruction alignment, overcoming the limitations of general metrics in capturing complex dynamics. Third, we introduce a training-free baseline, VM-Edit, which utilizes a dual-region denoising mechanism to achieve structure-aware control, balancing structural preservation and dynamic deformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while current methods have shortcomings in maintaining physical plausibility, our method achieves excellent performance across both standard and proposed metrics. We believe the benchmark could serve as a standard testing platform for advancing physics-aware video editing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18340v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Much? Adoption of Coding Agents on GitHub</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18341</link><description>arXiv:2601.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first half of 2025, coding agents have emerged as a category of development tools that have very quickly transitioned to the practice. Unlike ''traditional'' code completion LLMs such as Copilot, agents like Cursor, Claude Code, or Codex operate with high degrees of autonomy, up to generating complete pull requests starting from a developer-provided task description. This new mode of operation is poised to change the landscape in an even larger way than code completion LLMs did, making the need to study their impact critical. Also, unlike traditional LLMs, coding agents tend to leave more explicit traces in software engineering artifacts, such as co-authoring commits or pull requests. We leverage these traces to present the first large-scale study (129,134 projects) of the adoption of coding agents on GitHub, finding an estimated adoption rate of 15.85%--22.60%, which is very high for a technology only a few months old--and increasing. We carry out an in-depth study of the adopters we identified, finding that adoption is broad: it spans the entire spectrum of project maturity; it includes established organizations; and it concerns diverse programming languages or project topics. At the commit level, we find that commits assisted by coding agents are larger than commits only authored by human developers, and have a large proportion of features and bug fixes. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the practical use of coding agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18341v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Forecasting the Maintained Score from the OpenSSF Scorecard for GitHub Repositories linked to PyPI libraries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18344</link><description>arXiv:2601.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The OpenSSF Scorecard is widely used to assess the security posture of open-source software repositories, with the Maintained metric indicating recent development activity and helping identify potentially abandoned dependencies. However, this metric is inherently retrospective, reflecting only the past 90 days of activity and providing no insight into future maintenance, which limits its usefulness for proactive risk assessment. In this paper, we study to what extent future maintenance activity, as captured by the OpenSSF Maintained score, can be forecasted. We analyze 3,220 GitHub repositories associated with the top 1% most central PyPI libraries by PageRank and reconstruct historical Maintained scores over a three-year period. We formulate the task as multivariate time series forecasting and consider four target representations: raw scores, bucketed maintenance levels, numerical trend slopes, and categorical trend types. We compare a statistical model (VARMA), a machine learning model (Random Forest), and a deep learning model (LSTM) across training windows of 3-12 months and forecasting horizons of 1-6 months. Our results show that future maintenance activity can be predicted with meaningful accuracy, particularly for aggregated representations such as bucketed scores and trend types, achieving accuracies above 0.95 and 0.80, respectively. Simpler statistical and machine learning models perform on par with deep learning approaches, indicating that complex architectures are not required. These findings suggest that predictive modeling can effectively complement existing Scorecard metrics, enabling more proactive assessment of open-source maintenance risks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18344v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Promises, Perils, and (Timely) Heuristics for Mining Coding Agent Activity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18345</link><description>arXiv:2601.18345v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on existing low-level vision benchmarks, which primarily focus on generic images. However, their capabilities to perceive and assess portrait images, a domain characterized by distinct structural and perceptual properties, remain largely underexplored. To this end, we introduce Q-Bench-Portrait, the first holistic benchmark specifically designed for portrait image quality perception, comprising 2,765 image-question-answer triplets and featuring (1) diverse portrait image sources, including natural, synthetic distortion, AI-generated, artistic, and computer graphics images; (2) comprehensive quality dimensions, covering technical distortions, AIGC-specific distortions, and aesthetics; and (3) a range of question formats, including single-choice, multiple-choice, true/false, and open-ended questions, at both global and local levels. Based on Q-Bench-Portrait, we evaluate 20 open-source and 5 closed-source MLLMs, revealing that although current models demonstrate some competence in portrait image perception, their performance remains limited and imprecise, with a clear gap relative to human judgments. We hope that the proposed benchmark will foster further research into enhancing the portrait image perception capabilities of both general-purpose and domain-specific MLLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Maps of Tournaments: Distances, Experiments, and Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18348</link><description>arXiv:2601.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We form a "map of tournaments" by adapting the map framework from the world of elections. By a tournament we mean a complete directed graph where the nodes are the players and an edge points from a winner of a game to the loser (with no ties allowed). A map is a set of tournaments represented as points on a 2D plane, so that their Euclidean distances resemble the distances computed according to a given measure. We identify useful distance measures, discuss ways of generating random tournaments (and compare them to several real-life ones), and show how the maps are helpful in visualizing experimental results (also for knockout tournaments).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18348v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Domain Pretraining Interferes with Instruction Alignment: An Empirical Study of Adapter Merging in Medical LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18350</link><description>arXiv:2601.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong general capability but often struggle with medical terminology precision and safety-critical instruction following. We present a case study for adapter interference in safety-critical domains using a 14B-parameter base model through a two-stage LoRA pipeline: (1) domain-adaptive pre-training (PT) to inject broad medical knowledge via continued pre-training (DAPT), and (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model with medical question-answering behaviors through instruction-style data. To balance instruction-following ability and domain knowledge retention, we propose Weighted Adapter Merging, linearly combining SFT and PT adapters before exporting a merged base-model checkpoint. On a held-out medical validation set (F5/F6), the merged model achieves BLEU-4 = 16.38, ROUGE-1 = 20.42, ROUGE-2 = 4.60, and ROUGE-L = 11.54 under a practical decoding configuration. We further analyze decoding sensitivity and training stability with loss curves and controlled decoding comparisons.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18350v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Code over Words: Overcoming Semantic Inertia via Code-Grounded Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18352</link><description>arXiv:2601.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs struggle with Semantic Inertia: the inability to inhibit pre-trained priors (e.g., "Lava is Dangerous") when dynamic, in-context rules contradict them. We probe this phenomenon using Baba Is You, where physical laws are mutable text rules, enabling precise evaluation of models' ability to override learned priors when rules change. We quantatively observe that larger models can exhibit inverse scaling: they perform worse than smaller models when natural language reasoning requires suppressing pre-trained associations (e.g., accepting "Lava is Safe"). Our analysis attributes this to natural language encoding, which entangles descriptive semantics and logical rules, leading to persistent hallucinations of familiar physics despite explicit contradictory rules. Here we show that representing dynamics as executable code, rather than descriptive text, reverses this trend and enables effective prior inhibition. We introduce Code-Grounded Vistas (LCV), which fine-tunes models on counterfactual pairs and identifies states with contradictory rules, thereby forcing attention to logical constraints rather than visual semantics. This training-time approach outperforms expensive inference-time search methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that representation fundamentally determines whether scaling improves or impairs contextual reasoning. This challenges the assumption that larger models are universally better, with implications for domains that require dynamic overriding of learned priors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can Good Writing Be Generative?

Abstract: Creative writing has long been considered a uniquely human endeavor, requiring voice and style that machines could not replicate. This assumption is challenged by Generative AI that can emulate thousands of author styles in seconds with negligible marginal labor. To understand this better, we conducted a behavioral experiment where 28 MFA writers (experts) competed against three LLMs in emulating 50 critically acclaimed authors. Based on blind pairwise comparisons by 28 expert judges and 131 lay judges, we find that experts preferred human writing in 82.7% of cases under the in-context prompting condition but this reversed to 62% preference for AI after fine-tuning on authors' complete works. Lay judges, however, consistently preferred AI writing. Debrief interviews with expert writers revealed that their preference for AI writing triggered an identity crisis, eroding aesthetic confidence and questioning what constitutes "good writing." These findings challenge discourse about AI's creative limitations and raise fundamental questions about the future of creative labor.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18353v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Making medical vision-language models think causally across modalities with retrieval-augmented cross-modal reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18356</link><description>arXiv:2601.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in diagnostic reporting and image-text alignment, yet their underlying reasoning mechanisms remain fundamentally correlational, exhibiting reliance on superficial statistical associations that fail to capture the causal pathophysiological mechanisms central to clinical decision-making. This limitation makes them fragile, prone to hallucinations, and sensitive to dataset biases. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a partial remedy by grounding predictions in external knowledge. However, conventional RAG depends on semantic similarity, introducing new spurious correlations. We propose Multimodal Causal Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a framework that integrates causal inference principles with multimodal retrieval. It retrieves clinically relevant exemplars and causal graphs from external sources, conditioning model reasoning on counterfactual and interventional evidence rather than correlations alone. Applied to radiology report generation, diagnosis prediction, and visual question answering, it improves factual accuracy, robustness to distribution shifts, and interpretability. Our results highlight causal retrieval as a scalable path toward medical VLMs that think beyond pattern matching, enabling trustworthy multimodal reasoning in high-stakes clinical settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18356v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty Quantification in Calibration and Simulation of Thermo-Chemical Curing of Epoxy Resins</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18359</link><description>arXiv:2601.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curing of epoxy resins poses a particular challenge in terms of modeling, experimental investigation, and numerical implementation, as it is a thermo-chemo-mechanical process. Several constitutive relations are required to model these processes, yielding numerous material parameters. The calibration of the constitutive relations must be performed using multiple steps, wherein uncertainties unavoidably propagate. In this study, we investigate the propagation of uncertainties during both the multi-step calibration procedure and the numerical simulation of curing processes with the identified parameters. For both, we employ the first-order second-moment method, which is carefully evaluated through coverage tests and by comparing it to the Monte Carlo method as a reference. It is demonstrated that the first-order second-moment method efficiently yields reasonable results, although providing only a first-order approximation of the highly nonlinear stochastic model response.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Integrating HAPS, LEO, and Terrestrial Networks: A Cost-Performance Study for IoT Connectivity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18361</link><description>arXiv:2601.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work evaluates the potential of High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites as alternative or complementary systems to enhance Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. We first analyze the transmission erasure probability under different connectivity configurations, including only HAPS or LEO satellites, as well as hybrid architectures that integrate both aerial/spatial and terrestrial infrastructures. To make the analysis more realistic, we considered movement of LEO satellites regarding a fixed region, elevation angle between gateway and devices, and different fading models for terrestrial and non-terrestrial communication. We also analyze LR-FHSS (Long-Range Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) random access uplink technology as a potential use case for IoT connectivity, showing the scalability impact of the scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that HAPS can effectively complement sparse terrestrial networks and improve the performance of satellite-based systems in specific scenarios. Furthermore, considering the deployment and operational costs, respectively, CAPEX and OPEX, the economic analysis reveals that although HAPS exhibits higher costs, these remain within a comparable order of magnitude to LEO and terrestrial deployments. In addition, specific use cases, such as natural disasters, transform HAPS into a competitive technology for conventional infrastructures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18361v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Synchronization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18362</link><description>arXiv:2601.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the synchronization game on finite deterministic automata. In this game, Alice chooses one input letter of an automaton $A$ on each of her moves while Bob may respond with an arbitrary finite word over the input alphabet of $A$; Alice wins if the word obtained by interleaving her letters with Bob's responses resets $A$. We prove that if Alice has a winning strategy in this game on $A$, then $A$ admits a reset word whose length is strictly smaller than the number of states of $A$. In contrast, for any $k\ge 1$, we exhibit automata with shortest reset-word length quadratic in the number of states, on which Alice nevertheless wins a version of the game in which Bob's responses are restricted to arbitrary words of length at most $k$. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for deciding the winner in various synchronization games, and we analyze the relationships between variants of synchronization games on fixed-size automata.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18362v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Symplecticity-Preserving Prediction of Hamiltonian Dynamics by Generalized Kernel Interpolation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18364</link><description>arXiv:2601.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a kernel-based surrogate for integrating Hamiltonian dynamics that is symplectic by construction and tailored to large prediction horizons is proposed. The method learns a scalar potential whose gradient enters a symplectic-Euler update, yielding a discrete flow map that exactly preserves the canonical symplectic structure. Training is formulated as a gradient Hermite--Birkhoff interpolation problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, providing a systematic framework for existence, uniqueness, and error control. Algorithmically, the symplectic kernel predictor is combined with structure-preserving model order reduction, enabling efficient treatment of high-dimensional discretized PDEs. Numerical tests for a pendulum, a nonlinear spring--mass chain, and a semi-discrete wave equation show nearly algebraic greedy convergence and long-time trajectory errors reduce by two to three orders of magnitude compared to an implicit midpoint baseline at the same macro time step.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18364v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OREHAS: A fully automated deep-learning pipeline for volumetric endolymphatic hydrops quantification in MRI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18368</link><description>arXiv:2601.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present OREHAS (Optimized Recognition &amp; Evaluation of volumetric Hydrops in the Auditory System), the first fully automatic pipeline for volumetric quantification of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) from routine 3D-SPACE-MRC and 3D-REAL-IR MRI. The system integrates three components -- slice classification, inner ear localization, and sequence-specific segmentation -- into a single workflow that computes per-ear endolymphatic-to-vestibular volume ratios (ELR) directly from whole MRI volumes, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
  Trained with only 3 to 6 annotated slices per patient, OREHAS generalized effectively to full 3D volumes, achieving Dice scores of 0.90 for SPACE-MRC and 0.75 for REAL-IR. In an external validation cohort with complete manual annotations, OREHAS closely matched expert ground truth (VSI = 74.3%) and substantially outperformed the clinical syngo.via software (VSI = 42.5%), which tended to overestimate endolymphatic volumes. Across 19 test patients, vestibular measurements from OREHAS were consistent with syngo.via, while endolymphatic volumes were systematically smaller and more physiologically realistic.
  These results show that reliable and reproducible EH quantification can be achieved from standard MRI using limited supervision. By combining efficient deep-learning-based segmentation with a clinically aligned volumetric workflow, OREHAS reduces operator dependence, ensures methodological consistency. Besides, the results are compatible with established imaging protocols. The approach provides a robust foundation for large-scale studies and for recalibrating clinical diagnostic thresholds based on accurate volumetric measurements of the inner ear.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18368v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CitiLink: Enhancing Municipal Transparency and Citizen Engagement through Searchable Meeting Minutes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18374</link><description>arXiv:2601.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: City council minutes are typically lengthy and formal documents with a bureaucratic writing style. Although publicly available, their structure often makes it difficult for citizens or journalists to efficiently find information. In this demo, we present CitiLink, a platform designed to transform unstructured municipal meeting minutes into structured and searchable data, demonstrating how NLP and IR can enhance the accessibility and transparency of local government. The system employs LLMs to extract metadata, discussed subjects, and voting outcomes, which are then indexed in a database to support full-text search with BM25 ranking and faceted filtering through a user-friendly interface. The developed system was built over a collection of 120 minutes made available by six Portuguese municipalities. To assess its usability, CitiLink was tested through guided sessions with municipal personnel, providing insights into how real users interact with the system. In addition, we evaluated Gemini's performance in extracting relevant information from the minutes, highlighting its effectiveness in data extraction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18374v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Text Classification with LLM-Refined Taxonomies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18375</link><description>arXiv:2601.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) depends on taxonomies that organize labels into structured hierarchies. However, many real-world taxonomies introduce ambiguities, such as identical leaf names under similar parent nodes, which prevent language models (LMs) from learning clear decision boundaries. In this paper, we present TaxMorph, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to transform entire taxonomies through operations such as renaming, merging, splitting, and reordering. Unlike prior work, our method revises the full hierarchy to better match the semantics encoded by LMs. Experiments across three HTC benchmarks show that LLM-refined taxonomies consistently outperform human-curated ones in various settings up to +2.9pp. in F1. To better understand these improvements, we compare how well LMs can assign leaf nodes to parent nodes and vice versa across human-curated and LLM-refined taxonomies. We find that human-curated taxonomies lead to more easily separable clusters in embedding space. However, the LLM-refined taxonomies align more closely with the model's actual confusion patterns during classification. In other words, even though they are harder to separate, they better reflect the model's inductive biases. These findings suggest that LLM-guided refinement creates taxonomies that are more compatible with how models learn, improving HTC performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18375v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Corpus-Based Approaches to Igbo Diacritic Restoration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18380</link><description>arXiv:2601.18380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With natural language processing (NLP), researchers aim to enable computers to identify and understand patterns in human languages. This is often difficult because a language embeds many dynamic and varied properties in its syntax, pragmatics and phonology, which need to be captured and processed. The capacity of computers to process natural languages is increasing because NLP researchers are pushing its boundaries. But these research works focus more on well-resourced languages such as English, Japanese, German, French, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, etc. Over 95% of the world's 7000 languages are low-resourced for NLP, i.e. they have little or no data, tools, and techniques for NLP work.
  In this thesis, we present an overview of diacritic ambiguity and a review of previous diacritic disambiguation approaches on other languages. Focusing on the Igbo language, we report the steps taken to develop a flexible framework for generating datasets for diacritic restoration. Three main approaches, the standard n-gram model, the classification models and the embedding models were proposed. The standard n-gram models use a sequence of previous words to the target stripped word as key predictors of the correct variants. For the classification models, a window of words on both sides of the target stripped word was used. The embedding models compare the similarity scores of the combined context word embeddings and the embeddings of each of the candidate variant vectors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18380v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI Agent for Reverse-Engineering Legacy Finite-Difference Code and Translating to Devito</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18381</link><description>arXiv:2601.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate the transformation of legacy finite difference implementations into the Devito environment, this study develops an integrated AI agent framework. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and open-source Large Language Models are combined through multi-stage iterative workflows in the system's hybrid LangGraph architecture. The agent constructs an extensive Devito knowledge graph through document parsing, structure-aware segmentation, extraction of entity relationships, and Leiden-based community detection. GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability. A comprehensive validation framework integrates conventional static analysis with the G-Eval approach, covering execution correctness, structural soundness, mathematical consistency, and API compliance. The overall agent workflow is implemented on the LangGraph framework and adopts concurrent processing to support quality-based iterative refinement and state-aware dynamic routing. The principal contribution lies in the incorporation of feedback mechanisms motivated by reinforcement learning, enabling a transition from static code translation toward dynamic and adaptive analytical behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18381v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Thinking-Token Selection for Efficient Reasoning in Large Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18383</link><description>arXiv:2601.18383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems by explicitly generating a reasoning trace before deriving the final answer. However, these extended generations incur substantial memory footprint and computational overhead, bottlenecking LRMs' efficiency. This work uses attention maps to analyze the influence of reasoning traces and uncover an interesting phenomenon: only some decision-critical tokens in a reasoning trace steer the model toward the final answer, while the remaining tokens contribute negligibly. Building on this observation, we propose Dynamic Thinking-Token Selection (DynTS). This method identifies decision-critical tokens and retains only their associated Key-Value (KV) cache states during inference, evicting the remaining redundant entries to optimize efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18383v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Estimation of geometric transformation matrices using grid-shaped pilot signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18385</link><description>arXiv:2601.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital watermarking techniques are essential to prevent unauthorized use of images. Since pirated images are often geometrically distorted by operations such as scaling and cropping, accurate synchronization - detecting the embedding position of the watermark - is critical for proper extraction. In particular, cropping changes the origin of the image, making synchronization difficult. However, few existing methods are robust against cropping. To address this issue, we propose a watermarking method that estimates geometric transformations applied to a stego image using a pilot signal, allowing synchronization even after cropping. A grid-shaped pilot signal with distinct horizontal and vertical values is embedded in the image. When the image is transformed, the grid is also distorted. By analyzing this distortion, the transformation matrix can be estimated. Applying the Radon transform to the distorted image allows estimation of the grid angles and intervals. In addition, since the horizontal and vertical grid lines are encoded differently, the grid orientation can be determined, which reduces ambiguity. To validate our method, we performed simulations with anisotropic scaling, rotation, shearing, and cropping. The results show that the proposed method accurately estimates transformation matrices with low error under both single and composite attacks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18385v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARMOR: Agentic Reasoning for Methods Orchestration and Reparameterization for Robust Adversarial Attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18386</link><description>arXiv:2601.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing automated attack suites operate as static ensembles with fixed sequences, lacking strategic adaptation and semantic awareness. This paper introduces the Agentic Reasoning for Methods Orchestration and Reparameterization (ARMOR) framework to address these limitations. ARMOR orchestrates three canonical adversarial primitives, Carlini-Wagner (CW), Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), and Spatially Transformed Attacks (STA) via Vision Language Models (VLM)-guided agents that collaboratively generate and synthesize perturbations through a shared ``Mixing Desk". Large Language Models (LLMs) adaptively tune and reparameterize parallel attack agents in a real-time, closed-loop system that exploits image-specific semantic vulnerabilities. On standard benchmarks, ARMOR achieves improved cross-architecture transfer and reliably fools both settings, delivering a blended output for blind targets and selecting the best attack or blended attacks for white-box targets using a confidence-and-SSIM score.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18386v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Complex-Valued Vision Transformers for MRI Classification Directly from k-Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18392</link><description>arXiv:2601.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning applications in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) predominantly operate on reconstructed magnitude images, a process that discards phase information and requires computationally expensive transforms. Standard neural network architectures rely on local operations (convolutions or grid-patches) that are ill-suited for the global, non-local nature of raw frequency-domain (k-Space) data. In this work, we propose a novel complex-valued Vision Transformer (kViT) designed to perform classification directly on k-Space data. To bridge the geometric disconnect between current architectures and MRI physics, we introduce a radial k-Space patching strategy that respects the spectral energy distribution of the frequency-domain. Extensive experiments on the fastMRI and in-house datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves classification performance competitive with state-of-the-art image-domain baselines (ResNet, EfficientNet, ViT). Crucially, kViT exhibits superior robustness to high acceleration factors and offers a paradigm shift in computational efficiency, reducing VRAM consumption during training by up to 68$\times$ compared to standard methods. This establishes a pathway for resource-efficient, direct-from-scanner AI analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18392v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OCR-Enhanced Multimodal ASR Can Read While Listening</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18393</link><description>arXiv:2601.18393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual information, such as subtitles in a movie, often helps automatic speech recognition. In this paper, we propose Donut-Whisper, an audio-visual ASR model with dual encoder to leverage visual information to improve speech recognition performance in both English and Chinese. Donut-Whisper combines the advantage of the linear and the Q-Former-based modality alignment structures via a cross-attention module, generating more powerful audio-visual features. Meanwhile, we propose a lightweight knowledge distillation scheme showcasing the potential of using audio-visual models to teach audio-only models to achieve better performance. Moreover, we propose a new multilingual audio-visual speech recognition dataset based on movie clips containing both Chinese and English partitions. As a result, Donut-Whisper achieved significantly better performance on both English and Chinese partition of the dataset compared to both Donut and Whisper large V3 baselines. In particular, an absolute 5.75% WER reduction and a 16.5% absolute CER reduction were achieved on the English and Chinese sets respectively compared to the Whisper ASR baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18393v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do not be greedy, Think Twice: Sampling and Selection for Document-level Information Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18395</link><description>arXiv:2601.18395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document-level Information Extraction (DocIE) aims to produce an output template with the entities and relations of interest occurring in the given document. Standard practices include prompting decoder-only LLMs using greedy decoding to avoid output variability. Rather than treating this variability as a limitation, we show that sampling can produce substantially better solutions than greedy decoding, especially when using reasoning models. We thus propose ThinkTwice, a sampling and selection framework in which the LLM generates multiple candidate templates for a given document, and a selection module chooses the most suitable one. We introduce both an unsupervised method that exploits agreement across generated outputs, and a supervised selection method using reward models trained on labeled DocIE data. To address the scarcity of golden reasoning trajectories for DocIE, we propose a rejection-sampling-based method to generate silver training data that pairs output templates with reasoning traces. Our experiments show the validity of unsupervised and supervised ThinkTwice, consistently outperforming greedy baselines and the state-of-the-art.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18395v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Estimating Dense-Packed Zone Height in Liquid-Liquid Separation: A Physics-Informed Neural Network Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18399</link><description>arXiv:2601.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separating liquid-liquid dispersions in gravity settlers is critical in chemical, pharmaceutical, and recycling processes. The dense-packed zone height is an important performance and safety indicator but it is often expensive and impractical to measure due to optical limitations. We propose to estimate phase heights using only inexpensive volume flow measurements. To this end, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is first pretrained on synthetic data and physics equations derived from a low-fidelity (approximate) mechanistic model to reduce the need for extensive experimental data. While the mechanistic model is used to generate synthetic training data, only volume balance equations are used in the PINN, since the integration of submodels describing droplet coalescence and sedimentation into the PINN would be computationally prohibitive. The pretrained PINN is then fine-tuned with scarce experimental data to capture the actual dynamics of the separator. We then employ the differentiable PINN as a predictive model in an Extended Kalman Filter inspired state estimation framework, enabling the phase heights to be tracked and updated from flow-rate measurements. We first test the two-stage trained PINN by forward simulation from a known initial state against the mechanistic model and a non-pretrained PINN. We then evaluate phase height estimation performance with the filter, comparing the two-stage trained PINN with a two-stage trained purely data-driven neural network. All model types are trained and evaluated using ensembles to account for model parameter uncertainty. In all evaluations, the two-stage trained PINN yields the most accurate phase-height estimates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18399v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Superlinear Multi-Step Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401</link><description>arXiv:2601.18401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{Superlinear attention}, a fully trainable multi-step attention architecture that achieves subquadratic complexity for long sequences while preserving \textbf{random context access} (a.k.a.\ structural non-exclusion): no eligible token position is structurally excluded from being selected for attention. Superlinear attention reformulates standard causal self-attention as a multi-step search problem with $N$ steps, yielding an overall complexity of $O(L^{1+\frac{1}{N}})$. To illustrate the architecture, we present a baseline $N=2$ implementation, which is algorithmically analogous to standard jump search. In this $O(L^{3/2})$ instantiation, the first step performs $O(L^{3/2})$ span-search to select relevant spans of the sequence, and the second step applies $O(L^{3/2})$ span-attention (standard attention restricted to the selected spans). In an upscaled $O(L^{1.54})$ configuration for robustness, we achieve an average decoding throughput of 114 tokens/sec at 1M context length and 80 tokens/sec at 10M context in our implementation on a modified 30B hybrid MoE model on a single B200 GPU. With limited training, we also obtain strong performance on the NIAH (Needle In A Haystack) task up to 256K context length, demonstrating that the routed span selection is learnable end-to-end. This paper emphasizes architectural formulation, scaling analysis, and systems feasibility, and presents initial validation; comprehensive quality evaluations across diverse long-context tasks are left to future work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18401v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Larger than memory image processing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18407</link><description>arXiv:2601.18407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report addresses larger-than-memory image analysis for petascale datasets such as 1.4 PB electron-microscopy volumes and 150 TB human-organ atlases. We argue that performance is fundamentally I/O-bound. We show that structuring analysis as streaming passes over data is crucial. For 3D volumes, two representations are popular: stacks of 2D slices (e.g., directories or multi-page TIFF) and 3D chunked layouts (e.g., Zarr/HDF5). While for a few algorithms, chunked layout on disk is crucial to keep disk I/O at a minimum, we show how the slice-based streaming architecture can be built on top of either image representation in a manner that minimizes disk I/O. This is in particular advantageous for algorithms relying on neighbouring values, since the slicing streaming architecture is 1D, which implies that there are only 2 possible sweeping orders, both of which are aligned with the order in which images are read from the disk. This is in contrast to 3D chunks, in which any sweep cannot be done without accessing each chunk at least 9 times. We formalize this with sweep-based execution (natural 2D/3D orders), windowed operations, and overlap-aware tiling to minimize redundant access. Building on these principles, we introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes algorithms with intrinsic knowledge of their optimal streaming and memory use; the DSL performs compile-time and run-time pipeline analyses to automatically select window sizes, fuse stages, tee and zip streams, and schedule passes for limited-RAM machines, yielding near-linear I/O scans and predictable memory footprints. The approach integrates with existing tooling for segmentation and morphology but reframes pre/post-processing as pipelines that privilege sequential read/write patterns, delivering substantial throughput gains for extremely large images without requiring full-volume residency in memory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Frequency-Based Hyperparameter Selection in Games</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18409</link><description>arXiv:2601.18409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning in smooth games fundamentally differs from standard minimization due to rotational dynamics, which invalidate classical hyperparameter tuning strategies. Despite their practical importance, effective methods for tuning in games remain underexplored. A notable example is LookAhead (LA), which achieves strong empirical performance but introduces additional parameters that critically influence performance. We propose a principled approach to hyperparameter selection in games by leveraging frequency estimation of oscillatory dynamics. Specifically, we analyze oscillations both in continuous-time trajectories and through the spectrum of the discrete dynamics in the associated frequency-based space. Building on this analysis, we introduce \emph{Modal LookAhead (MoLA)}, an extension of LA that selects the hyperparameters adaptively to a given problem. We provide convergence guarantees and demonstrate in experiments that MoLA accelerates training in both purely rotational games and mixed regimes, all with minimal computational overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18409v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Time-Scale-Adaptable Spectrum Sharing for Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18410</link><description>arXiv:2601.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation between satellite and terrestrial wireless networks promises great potential in meeting fast-growing demands for ubiquitous communications coverage. To tackle spectrum scarcity, spectrum sharing is studied for a hybrid satellite-terrestrial network where satellite links share the same group of time-slotted sub-carriers with terrestrial links opportunistically. In particular, with coarse network-wide time synchronization, a time-scale-adaptable spectrum sharing framework is proposed based on a satellite-terrestrial cooperation time scale that can be flexibly adjusted according to practical requirements. For generality, it is assumed that both full and partial frequency reuse could be adopted among the base stations (BSs) and satellite selection is supported when multiple satellites are available. Relying on only statistical channel state information (CSI), joint link scheduling and power control are explored to maximize the average sum rate of the network while ensuring quality of service (QoS) for users. To solve the complicated mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, a low-complexity spectrum sharing scheme is presented based on link-feature-sketching-aided hierarchical link clustering and Monte-Carlo-and-successive-approximation-aided transmit power optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that by link feature sketching, diversity of the links brought by the spatial distribution of the users could be well utilized. The proposed scheme promises a significant performance gain even under strict inter-link interference constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18410v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Comparative Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Affective State Recognition from Children's Drawings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18414</link><description>arXiv:2601.18414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties in expressing emotions and communication, particularly during early childhood. Understanding the affective state of children at an early age remains challenging, as conventional assessment methods are often intrusive, subjective, or difficult to apply consistently. This paper builds upon previous work on affective state recognition from children's drawings by presenting a comparative evaluation of machine learning models for emotion classification. Three deep learning architectures -- MobileNet, EfficientNet, and VGG16 -- are evaluated within a unified experimental framework to analyze classification performance, robustness, and computational efficiency. The models are trained using transfer learning on a dataset of children's drawings annotated with emotional labels provided by psychological experts. The results highlight important trade-offs between lightweight and deeper architectures when applied to drawing-based affective computing tasks, particularly in mobile and real-time application contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18414v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pisets: A Robust Speech Recognition System for Lectures and Interviews</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18415</link><description>arXiv:2601.18415v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: This work extends the application of Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods to higher-order cell-centred finite-volume formulations for solid mechanics. While conventional schemes are typically limited to second-order accuracy, we present third- and fourth-order formulations employing local least-squares reconstructions for gradient evaluation and Gaussian quadrature at cell faces. These schemes enable accurate resolution of complex stress and deformation fields in linear and nonlinear solids while retaining the flexibility of finite-volume methods. A key contribution is a JFNK solution strategy for these higher-order schemes, eliminating the need to assemble complex Jacobian matrices. A compact-stencil approximate Jacobian is used as a preconditioner, providing efficiency gains similar to second-order frameworks. To enhance robustness on irregular meshes, an alpha-stabilisation scheme is incorporated, damping high-frequency error modes without compromising formal accuracy. The proposed methodology is benchmarked across a suite of two- and three-dimensional test problems involving elastic and nonlinear materials, where key performance metrics, including accuracy, computational cost, memory usage, and robustness, are systematically evaluated. Results confirm that the higher-order formulations deliver substantial accuracy improvements over second-order schemes, while the JFNK approach achieves strong performance with only minimal modifications to existing segregated frameworks. These findings underscore the potential of combining higher-order finite-volume methods with JFNK solvers to advance the state of the art in computational solid mechanics.

Abstract: Recently, the frontier of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities has shifted from single-turn code generation to agentic software engineering-a paradigm where models autonomously navigate, edit, and test complex repositories. While post-training methods have become the de facto approach for code agents, **agentic mid-training**-mid-training (MT) on large-scale data that mirrors authentic agentic workflows-remains critically underexplored due to substantial resource requirements, despite offering a more scalable path to instilling foundational agentic behaviors than relying solely on expensive reinforcement learning. A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity. We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`. We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe `Kimi-Dev` under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B). Besides relative advantage, our best performing 32B and 72B models achieve **56.1%** and **58.5%** resolution rates, respectively, which are ...</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18418v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gradient Regularized Natural Gradients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18420</link><description>arXiv:2601.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient regularization (GR) has been shown to improve the generalizability of trained models. While Natural Gradient Descent has been shown to accelerate optimization in the initial phase of training, little attention has been paid to how the training dynamics of second-order optimizers can benefit from GR. In this work, we propose Gradient-Regularized Natural Gradients (GRNG), a family of scalable second-order optimizers that integrate explicit gradient regularization with natural gradient updates. Our framework provides two complementary algorithms: a frequentist variant that avoids explicit inversion of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) via structured approximations, and a Bayesian variant based on a Regularized-Kalman formulation that eliminates the need for FIM inversion entirely. We establish convergence guarantees for GRNG, showing that gradient regularization improves stability and enables convergence to global minima. Empirically, we demonstrate that GRNG consistently enhances both optimization speed and generalization compared to first-order methods (SGD, AdamW) and second-order baselines (K-FAC, Sophia), with strong results on vision and language benchmarks. Our findings highlight gradient regularization as a principled and practical tool to unlock the robustness of natural gradient methods for large-scale deep learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18420v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fusion of Spatio-Temporal and Multi-Scale Frequency Features for Dry Electrodes MI-EEG Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18424</link><description>arXiv:2601.18424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dry-electrode Motor Imagery Electroencephalography (MI-EEG) enables fast, comfortable, real-world Brain Computer Interface by eliminating gels and shortening setup for at-home and wearable use.However, dry recordings pose three main issues: lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio with more baseline drift and sudden transients; weaker and noisier data with poor phase alignment across trials; and bigger variances between sessions. These drawbacks lead to larger data distribution shift, making features less stable for MI-EEG tasks.To address these problems, we introduce STGMFM, a tri-branch framework tailored for dry-electrode MI-EEG, which models complementary spatio-temporal dependencies via dual graph orders, and captures robust envelope dynamics with a multi-scale frequency mixing branch, motivated by the observation that amplitude envelopes are less sensitive to contact variability than instantaneous waveforms. Physiologically meaningful connectivity priors guide learning, and decision-level fusion consolidates a noise-tolerant consensus. On our collected dry-electrode MI-EEG, STGMFM consistently surpasses competitive CNN/Transformer/graph baselines.

Abstract: Although generative diffusion models (GDMs) are widely used in practice, their theoretical foundations remain limited, especially concerning the impact of different discretization schemes applied to the underlying stochastic differential equation (SDE). Existing convergence analysis largely focuses on Euler-Maruyama (EM)-like methods and does not extend to higher-order schemes, which are naturally expected to provide improved discretization accuracy. In this paper, we establish asymptotic 2-Wasserstein convergence results for SDE-based discretization methods employed in sampling for GDMs. We provide an all-at-once error bound analysis of the EM method that accounts for all error sources and establish convergence under all prevalent score-matching error assumptions in the literature, assuming a strongly log-concave data distribution. Moreover, we present the first error bound result for arbitrary higher-order SDE-discretization methods with known strong L_2 convergence in dependence on the discretization grid and the score-matching error. Finally, we complement our theoretical findings with an extensive numerical study, providing comprehensive experimental evidence and showing that, contrary to popular believe, higher order discretization methods can in fact retain their theoretical advantage over EM for sampling GDMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18425v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Collaposer: Transforming Photo Collections into Visual Assets for Storytelling with Collages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18428</link><description>arXiv:2601.18428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital collage is an artistic practice that combines image cutouts to tell stories. However, preparing cutouts from a set of photos remains a tedious and time-consuming task. A formative study identified three main challenges: 1) inefficient search for relevant photos, 2) manual image cutout, and 3) difficulty in organizing large sets of cutouts. To meet these challenges and facilitate asset preparation for collage, we propose Collaposer, a tool that transforms a collection of photos into organized, ready-to-use visual cutouts based on user-provided story descriptions. Collaposer tags, detects, and segments photos, and then uses an LLM to select central and related labels based on the user-provided story description. Collaposer presents the resulting visuals in varying sizes, clustered according to semantic hierarchy. Our evaluation shows that Collaposer effectively automates the preparation process to produce diverse sets of visual cutouts adhering to the storyline, allowing users to focus on collaging these assets for storytelling.

Abstract: This paper explores the fine-grained structure of classes of regular languages maintainable in fragments of first-order logic within the dynamic descriptive complexity framework of Patnaik and Immerman. A result by Hesse states that the class of regular languages is maintainable by first-order formulas even if only unary auxiliary relations can be used. Another result by Gelade, Marquardt,and Schwentick states that the class of regular languages coincides with the class of languages maintainable by quantifier-free formulas with binary auxiliary relations. We refine Hesse's result and show that with unary auxiliary data formulas with one quantifier alternation can maintain all regular languages. We then obtain precise algebraic characterizations of the classes of languages maintainable with quantifier-free formulas and positive existential formulas in the presence of unary auxiliary relations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18429v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TopKGAT: A Top-K Objective-Driven Architecture for Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18432</link><description>arXiv:2601.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems (RS) aim to retrieve the top-K items most relevant to users, with metrics such as Precision@K and Recall@K commonly used to assess effectiveness. The architecture of an RS model acts as an inductive bias, shaping the patterns the model is inclined to learn. In recent years, numerous recommendation architectures have emerged, spanning traditional matrix factorization, deep neural networks, and graph neural networks. However, their designs are often not explicitly aligned with the top-K objective, thereby limiting their effectiveness.
  To address this limitation, we propose TopKGAT, a novel recommendation architecture directly derived from a differentiable approximation of top-K metrics. The forward computation of a single TopKGAT layer is intrinsically aligned with the gradient ascent dynamics of the Precision@K metric, enabling the model to naturally improve top-K recommendation accuracy. Structurally, TopKGAT resembles a graph attention network and can be implemented efficiently. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that TopKGAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/StupidThree/TopKGAT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18432v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Quantum Cliff: A Critical Proton Tunneling Threshold Determines Clinical Severity in RPE65-Mediated Retinal Disease</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18435</link><description>arXiv:2601.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting clinical severity from genotype remains a fundamental challenge in molecular medicine, particularly for enzymes whose function depends on sub-atomic-scale geometry. Mutations in the \textit{RPE65} isomerohydrolase cause Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and related retinal diseases; however, the kinetic mechanisms connecting sub-atomic-scale perturbations to blindness remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that mutations in the human visual isomerase RPE65 are governed by a quantum-mechanical threshold effect arising from proton tunneling in the active site. We established a hybrid quantum-classical structure-to-phenotype pipeline combining AlphaFold structure prediction with \textit{ab initio} quantum simulation using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to analyze minimal proton-coupled electron transfer in the visual cycle. Our analysis reveals that many pathogenic mutations do not merely occlude the active site, but rather strongly reduce the quantum probability of proton tunneling. We observed a sharp non-linear effect, termed the "Quantum Cliff," where minute structural changes (below 0.1 \AA) reduce the reaction rate by multiple orders of magnitude. Based on these findings, we introduce a dimensionless Relative Quantum Activity Score (RQAS) that isolates the geometry-controlled exponential sensitivity of the reaction rate and successfully distinguishes between mild and severe patient phenotypes. These results suggest that RPE65 operates near a quantum-critical point, where sub-Angstrom structural perturbations induce a catastrophic loss of function. Furthermore, our findings establish quantum tunneling as a predictive mechanistic link between atomic structure and clinical phenotype, proposing a general framework for quantum-structural disease modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18435v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Properties of calculus in r-Complexity 2025</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18437</link><description>arXiv:2601.18437v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Automatic speech quality assessment has become increasingly important as modern speech generation systems continue to advance, while human listening tests remain costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. Most existing learning-based assessment models rely primarily on scarce human-annotated mean opinion score (MOS) data, which limits robustness and generalization, especially when training across heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we propose UrgentMOS, a unified speech quality assessment framework that jointly learns from diverse objective and perceptual quality metrics, while explicitly tolerating the absence of arbitrary subsets of metrics during training. By leveraging complementary quality facets under heterogeneous supervision, UrgentMOS enables effective utilization of partially annotated data and improves robustness when trained on large-scale, multi-source datasets. Beyond absolute score prediction, UrgentMOS explicitly models pairwise quality preferences by directly predicting comparative MOS (CMOS), making it well suited for preference-based evaluation scenarios commonly adopted in system benchmarking. Extensive experiments across a wide range of speech quality datasets, including simulated distortions, speech enhancement, and speech synthesis, demonstrate that UrgentMOS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both absolute and comparative evaluation settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Optimal Message Size in PIR Under Arbitrary Collusion Patterns</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18440</link><description>arXiv:2601.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A private information retrieval protocol (PIR) scheme under an arbitrary collusion pattern $\mathcal{P}$ enables a client to retrieve one message from a library of $K$ equal-sized messages duplicated in $N$ servers, while keeping the index of the desired message private from any colluding set in $\mathcal{P}$. Although achieving high rates typically requires sufficiently large message sizes, smaller message sizes also desirable due to reduced implementation complexity and fewer constraints. By characterizing the capacity-achieving schemes, Tian, Sun, and Chen (2019) showed that the optimal message size for uniformly decomposable PIR schemes under no-collusion setting is $N-1$. However, comparable results are not yet available for more general collusion settings.
  In this work, we present a complete characterization of the properties of capacity-achieving decomposable PIR schemes under arbitrary collusion patterns. Building on this characterization, we derive a general lower bound on the optimal message size for capacity-achieving uniformly decomposable PIR schemes under an arbitrary collusion pattern $\mathcal{P}$, expressed in terms of the hitting number of a newly defined family of subsets of servers determined by the collusion pattern $\mathcal{P}$. Finally, we specialize the lower bound to several important classes of collusion patterns, including $T$-collusion, disjoint collections of colluding sets, cyclically $T$-contiguous collusion, and disjoint collections of cyclically contiguous colluding sets. For the last two collusion patterns, we present matching achievable schemes that attain the corresponding bounds, thereby providing a complete characterization of the optimal message size.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18440v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Coding Schemes for Document Exchange under Multiple Substring Edits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18441</link><description>arXiv:2601.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the document exchange problem under multiple substring edits. A substring edit in a string $\mathbf{x}$ occurs when a substring $\mathbf{u}$ of $\mathbf{x}$ is replaced by an arbitrary string $\mathbf{v}$. The lengths of $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are bounded from above by a fixed constant. Let $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ be two binary strings that differ by multiple substring edits. The aim of document exchange schemes is to construct an encoding of $\mathbf{x}$ with small length such that $\mathbf{x}$ can be recovered using $\mathbf{y}$ and the encoding. We construct a low-complexity document exchange scheme with encoding length of $4t\log n+o(\log n)$ bits, where $n$ is the length of the string $\mathbf{x}$. The best known scheme achieves an encoding length of $4t \log n+O(\log\log n)$ bits, but at a much higher computational complexity. Then, we investigate the average length of valid encodings for document exchange schemes with uniform strings $\mathbf{x}$ and develop a scheme with an expected encoding length of $(4t-1) \log n+o(\log n)$ bits. In this setting, prior works have only constructed schemes for a single substring edit.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18441v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SG-CADVLM: A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18442</link><description>arXiv:2601.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicle safety validation requires testing on safety-critical scenarios, but these events are rare in real-world driving and costly to test due to collision risks. Crash reports provide authentic specifications of safety-critical events, offering a vital alternative to scarce real-world collision trajectory data. This makes them valuable sources for generating realistic high-risk scenarios through simulation. Existing approaches face significant limitations because data-driven methods lack diversity due to their reliance on existing latent distributions, whereas adversarial methods often produce unrealistic scenarios lacking physical fidelity. Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM)-based methods show significant promise. However, they suffer from context suppression issues where internal parametric knowledge overrides crash specifications, producing scenarios that deviate from actual accident characteristics. This paper presents SG-CADVLM (A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation), a framework that integrates Context-Aware Decoding with multi-modal input processing to generate safety-critical scenarios from crash reports and road network diagrams. The framework mitigates VLM hallucination issues while enabling the simultaneous generation of road geometry and vehicle trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate that SG-CADVLM generates critical risk scenarios at a rate of 84.4% compared to 12.5% for the baseline methods, representing an improvement of 469%, while producing executable simulations for autonomous vehicle testing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Behaviors of Evolutionary Algorithms on GPUs: When Does Parallelism Pay Off?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18446</link><description>arXiv:2601.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are increasingly implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs) to leverage parallel processing capabilities for enhanced efficiency. However, existing studies largely emphasize the raw speedup obtained by porting individual algorithms from CPUs to GPUs. Consequently, these studies offer limited insight into when and why GPU parallelism fundamentally benefits EAs. To address this gap, we investigate how GPU parallelism alters the behavior of EAs beyond simple acceleration metrics. We conduct a systematic empirical study of 16 representative EAs on 30 benchmark problems. Specifically, we compare CPU and GPU executions across a wide range of problem dimensionalities and population sizes. Our results reveal that the impact of GPU acceleration is highly heterogeneous and depends strongly on algorithmic structure. We further demonstrate that conventional fixed-budget evaluation based on the number of function evaluations (FEs) is inadequate for GPU execution. In contrast, fixed-time evaluation uncovers performance characteristics that are unobservable under small or practically constrained FE budgets, particularly for adaptive and exploration-oriented algorithms. Moreover, we identify distinct scaling regimes in which GPU parallelism is beneficial, saturates, or degrades as problem dimensionality and population size increase. Crucially, we show that large populations enabled by GPUs not only improve hardware utilization but also reveal algorithm-specific convergence and diversity dynamics that are difficult to observe under CPU-constrained settings. Consequently, our findings indicate that GPU parallelism is not strictly an implementation detail, but a pivotal factor that influences how EAs should be evaluated, compared, and designed for modern computing platforms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18446v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GCFX: Generative Counterfactual Explanations for Deep Graph Models at the Model Level</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18447</link><description>arXiv:2601.18447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep graph learning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing graph-structured data and have been widely applied across various fields. However, their complex internal architectures and lack of transparency make it difficult to explain their decisions, resulting in opaque models that users find hard to understand and trust. In this paper, we explore model-level explanation techniques for deep graph learning models, aiming to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the models' overall decision-making processes and underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we address the problem of counterfactual explanations for deep graph learning models by introducing a generative model-level counterfactual explanation approach called GCFX, which is based on deep graph generation. This approach generates a set of high-quality counterfactual explanations that reflect the model's global predictive behavior by leveraging an enhanced deep graph generation framework and a global summarization algorithm. GCFX features an architecture that combines dual encoders, structure-aware taggers, and Message Passing Neural Network decoders, enabling it to accurately learn the true latent distribution of input data and generate high-quality, closely related counterfactual examples. Subsequently, a global counterfactual summarization algorithm selects the most representative and comprehensive explanations from numerous candidate counterfactuals, providing broad insights into the model's global predictive patterns. Experiments on a synthetic dataset and several real-world datasets demonstrate that GCFX outperforms existing methods in terms of counterfactual validity and coverage while maintaining low explanation costs, thereby offering crucial support for enhancing the practicality and trustworthiness of global counterfactual explanations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18447v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On Procrustes Contamination in Machine Learning Applications of Geometric Morphometrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18448</link><description>arXiv:2601.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric morphometrics (GMM) is widely used to quantify shape variation, more recently serving as input for machine learning (ML) analyses. Standard practice aligns all specimens via Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) prior to splitting data into training and test sets, potentially introducing statistical dependence and contaminating downstream predictive models. Here, the effects of GPA-induced contamination are formally characterised using controlled 2D and 3D simulations across varying sample sizes, landmark densities, and allometric patterns. A novel realignment procedure is proposed, whereby test specimens are aligned to the training set prior to model fitting, eliminating cross-sample dependency. Simulations reveal a robust "diagonal" in sample-size vs. landmark-space, reflecting the scaling of RMSE under isotropic variation, with slopes analytically derived from the degrees of freedom in Procrustes tangent space. The importance of spatial autocorrelation among landmarks is further demonstrated using linear and convolutional regression models, highlighting performance degradation when landmark relationships are ignored. This work establishes the need for careful preprocessing in ML applications of GMM, provides practical guidelines for realignment, and clarifies fundamental statistical constraints inherent to Procrustes shape space.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18448v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] 3DGesPolicy: Phoneme-Aware Holistic Co-Speech Gesture Generation Based on Action Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18451</link><description>arXiv:2601.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating holistic co-speech gestures that integrate full-body motion with facial expressions suffers from semantically incoherent coordination on body motion and spatially unstable meaningless movements due to existing part-decomposed or frame-level regression methods, We introduce 3DGesPolicy, a novel action-based framework that reformulates holistic gesture generation as a continuous trajectory control problem through diffusion policy from robotics. By modeling frame-to-frame variations as unified holistic actions, our method effectively learns inter-frame holistic gesture motion patterns and ensures both spatially and semantically coherent movement trajectories that adhere to realistic motion manifolds. To further bridge the gap in expressive alignment, we propose a Gesture-Audio-Phoneme (GAP) fusion module that can deeply integrate and refine multi-modal signals, ensuring structured and fine-grained alignment between speech semantics, body motion, and facial expressions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the BEAT2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our 3DGesPolicy across other state-of-the-art methods in generating natural, expressive, and highly speech-aligned holistic gestures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18451v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Geneses: Unified Generative Speech Enhancement and Separation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18456</link><description>arXiv:2601.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world audio recordings often contain multiple speakers and various degradations, which limit both the quantity and quality of speech data available for building state-of-the-art speech processing models. Although end-to-end approaches that concatenate speech enhancement (SE) and speech separation (SS) to obtain a clean speech signal for each speaker are promising, conventional SE-SS methods suffer from complex degradations beyond additive noise. To this end, we propose \textbf{Geneses}, a generative framework to achieve unified, high-quality SE--SS. Our Geneses leverages latent flow matching to estimate each speaker's clean speech features using multi-modal diffusion Transformer conditioned on self-supervised learning representation from noisy mixture. We conduct experimental evaluation using two-speaker mixtures from LibriTTS-R under two conditions: additive-noise-only and complex degradations. The results demonstrate that Geneses significantly outperforms a conventional mask-based SE--SS method across various objective metrics with high robustness against complex degradations. Audio samples are available in our demo page.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18456v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Token-level Collaborative Alignment for LLM-based Generative Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18457</link><description>arXiv:2601.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for generative recommendation by leveraging rich semantic knowledge. However, existing LLM-based recommender systems struggle to effectively incorporate collaborative filtering (CF) signals, due to a fundamental mismatch between item-level preference modeling in CF and token-level next-token prediction (NTP) optimization in LLMs. Prior approaches typically treat CF as contextual hints or representation bias, and resort to multi-stage training to reduce behavioral semantic space discrepancies, leaving CF unable to explicitly regulate LLM generation. In this work, we propose Token-level Collaborative Alignment for Recommendation (TCA4Rec), a model-agnostic and plug-and-play framework that establishes an explicit optimization-level interface between CF supervision and LLM generation. TCA4Rec consists of (i) Collaborative Tokenizer, which projects raw item-level CF logits into token-level distributions aligned with the LLM token space, and (ii) Soft Label Alignment, which integrates these CF-informed distributions with one-hot supervision to optimize a soft NTP objective. This design preserves the generative nature of LLM training while enabling collaborative alignment with essential user preference of CF models. We highlight TCA4Rec is compatible with arbitrary traditional CF models and generalizes across a wide range of decoder-based LLM recommender architectures. Moreover, it provides an explicit mechanism to balance behavioral alignment and semantic fluency, yielding generative recommendations that are both accurate and controllable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA4Rec consistently improves recommendation performance across a broad spectrum of CF models and LLM-based recommender systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18457v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking AI in the age of climate collapse: Ethics, power, and responsibility</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18462</link><description>arXiv:2601.18462v1 Announce Type: new

This contribution examines the ambivalent role of AI in the ecological crisis, addressing both its promises and its risks. On the one hand, AI supports improvements in climate forecasting, renewable energy management, and real-time detection of environmental degradation. On the other hand, the energy demands of data centres, resource-intensive hardware production, algorithmic bias, corporate concentration of power, and technocratic decision-making reveal contradictions that challenge its sustainability. The discussion explores these issues through interdisciplinary lenses, including environmental ethics, philosophy of technology, and legal governance, and concludes with recommendations for socially just, ecologically responsible, and democratically accountable uses of AI. Rather than assuming AI as an inherently sustainable solution, this analysis argues that its contribution to climate action depends fundamentally on the values, institutions, and power structures that shape its development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18462v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Justification of a Relaxation Approximation for the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18463</link><description>arXiv:2601.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard (NSCH) system governs the diffuse-interface dynamics of two incompressible and immiscible fluids. We consider a relaxation approximation of the NSCH system that is composed by a system of first-order hyperbolic balance laws and second-order elliptic operators. We prove first that the solutions of an initial boundary value problem for the approximation recover the limiting NSCH system for vanishing relaxation parameters. To cope with the singular limit we exploit the fact that the approximate solutions dissipate an almost quadratic energy, and employ the relative entropy-framework. In the second part of the work we provide numerical evidence for the analytical results, even in flow regimes not covered by the assumptions needed for the theoretical results. Using a novel marker-and-cell conservative finite-difference approach for both the approximation and the limit system, we are able to compute physically relevant interfacial flow problems including Ostwald ripening and high-velocity flow.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18463v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fair-Eye Net: A Fair, Trustworthy, Multimodal Integrated Glaucoma Full Chain AI System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18464</link><description>arXiv:2601.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glaucoma is a top cause of irreversible blindness globally, making early detection and longitudinal follow-up pivotal to preventing permanent vision loss. Current screening and progression assessment, however, rely on single tests or loosely linked examinations, introducing subjectivity and fragmented care. Limited access to high-quality imaging tools and specialist expertise further compromises consistency and equity in real-world use. To address these gaps, we developed Fair-Eye Net, a fair, reliable multimodal AI system closing the clinical loop from glaucoma screening to follow-up and risk alerting. It integrates fundus photos, OCT structural metrics, VF functional indices, and demographic factors via a dual-stream heterogeneous fusion architecture, with an uncertainty-aware hierarchical gating strategy for selective prediction and safe referral. A fairness constraint reduces missed diagnoses in disadvantaged subgroups. Experimental results show it achieved an AUC of 0.912 (96.7% specificity), cut racial false-negativity disparity by 73.4% (12.31% to 3.28%), maintained stable cross-domain performance, and enabled 3-12 months of early risk alerts (92% sensitivity, 88% specificity). Unlike post hoc fairness adjustments, Fair-Eye Net optimizes fairness as a primary goal with clinical reliability via multitask learning, offering a reproducible path for clinical translation and large-scale deployment to advance global eye health equity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18464v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OffSeeker: Online Reinforcement Learning Is Not All You Need for Deep Research Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18467</link><description>arXiv:2601.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep research agents have shown remarkable potential in handling long-horizon tasks. However, state-of-the-art performance typically relies on online reinforcement learning (RL), which is financially expensive due to extensive API calls. While offline training offers a more efficient alternative, its progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality research trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate that expensive online reinforcement learning is not all you need to build powerful research agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully open-source suite designed for effective offline training. Our core contributions include DeepForge, a ready-to-use task synthesis framework that generates large-scale research queries without heavy preprocessing; and a curated collection of 66k QA pairs, 33k SFT trajectories, and 21k DPO pairs. Leveraging these resources, we train OffSeeker (8B), a model developed entirely offline. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show that OffSeeker not only leads among similar-sized agents but also remains competitive with 30B-parameter systems trained via heavy online RL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18467v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Latent Knowledge as a Predictor of Fact Acquisition in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18468</link><description>arXiv:2601.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models store biomedical facts with uneven strength after pretraining: some facts are present in the weights but are not reliably accessible under deterministic decoding (latent knowledge), while others are scarcely represented. We fine tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct to learn ontology term identifier mappings from the Human Phenotype Ontology (800 pairs) and the Gene Ontology (400 training pairs), withholding 400 GO pairs to test generalization. Treating learning as a time to event process across 20 epochs, we used stochastic decoding to detect latent knowledge at baseline and Cox proportional hazards models to identify predictors of acquisition, generalization, and degradation. Baseline deterministic recall for HPO was 2.8%, rising to 71.9% after fine-tuning. Latent knowledge was the strongest predictor of faster fact acquisition (HR 2.6) and was associated with earlier, higher peak learning rates and faster convergence; identifier frequency and curated annotation counts had smaller effects. Generalization to withheld GO facts was uncommon (5.8%) but more likely when latent knowledge was present. Previously correct GO mappings degraded more often for withheld (unseen) terms than for trained (seen) terms, suggesting a protective effect of reinforcement during training. These results show that latent knowledge predicts both the speed of factual learning during fine-tuning and the limited generalization of unseen ontology facts, while resistance to degradation depends on whether facts are reinforced.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18468v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LoD-Structured 3D Gaussian Splatting for Streaming Video Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18475</link><description>arXiv:2601.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) reconstruction enables photorealistic and interactive 3D scene visualization; however, real-time streaming is often bottlenecked by sparse-view inputs, prohibitive training costs, and bandwidth constraints. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced FVV due to its superior rendering speed, Streaming Free-Viewpoint Video (SFVV) introduces additional demands for rapid optimization, high-fidelity reconstruction under sparse constraints, and minimal storage footprints. To bridge this gap, we propose StreamLoD-GS, an LoD-based Gaussian Splatting framework designed specifically for SFVV. Our approach integrates three core innovations: 1) an Anchor- and Octree-based LoD-structured 3DGS with a hierarchical Gaussian dropout technique to ensure efficient and stable optimization while maintaining high-quality rendering; 2) a GMM-based motion partitioning mechanism that separates dynamic and static content, refining dynamic regions while preserving background stability; and 3) a quantized residual refinement framework that significantly reduces storage requirements without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StreamLoD-GS achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality, efficiency, and storage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18475v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Audit of Machine Learning Experiments on Software Defect Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18477</link><description>arXiv:2601.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Machine learning algorithms are widely used to predict defect prone software components. In this literature, computational experiments are the main means of evaluation, and the credibility of results depends on experimental design and reporting. Objective: This paper audits recent software defect prediction (SDP) studies by assessing their experimental design, analysis, and reporting practices against accepted norms from statistics, machine learning, and empirical software engineering. The aim is to characterise current practice and assess the reproducibility of published results. Method: We audited SDP studies indexed in SCOPUS between 2019 and 2023, focusing on design and analysis choices such as outcome measures, out of sample validation strategies, and the use of statistical inference. Nine study issues were evaluated. Reproducibility was assessed using the instrument proposed by Gonz\'alez Barahona and Robles. Results: The search identified approximately 1,585 SDP experiments published during the period. From these, we randomly sampled 101 papers, including 61 journal and 40 conference publications, with almost 50 percent behind paywalls. We observed substantial variation in research practice. The number of datasets ranged from 1 to 365, learners or learner variants from 1 to 34, and performance measures from 1 to 9. About 45 percent of studies applied formal statistical inference. Across the sample, we identified 427 issues, with a median of four per paper, and only one paper without issues. Reproducibility ranged from near complete to severely limited. We also identified two cases of tortured phrases and possible paper mill activity. Conclusions: Experimental design and reporting practices vary widely, and almost half of the studies provide insufficient detail to support reproduction. The audit indicates substantial scope for improvement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18477v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Funny or Persuasive, but Not Both: Evaluating Fine-Grained Multi-Concept Control in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18483</link><description>arXiv:2601.18483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong generative capabilities, but many applications require explicit and \textit{fine-grained} control over specific textual concepts, such as humor, persuasiveness, or formality. Prior approaches in prompting and representation engineering can provide coarse or single-attribute control, but systematic evaluation of multi-attribute settings remains limited. We introduce an evaluation framework for fine-grained controllability for both single- and dual-concept scenarios, focusing on linguistically distinct concept pairs (e.g., persuasiveness vs.~humor). Surprisingly, across multiple LLMs and generative tasks, we find that performance often drops in the dual-concept setting, even though the chosen concepts should in principle be separable. This reveals a fundamental limitation of naive prompting-based control: models struggle with compositionality even when concepts are intuitively independent. Our framework provides systematic evidence of this gap and offers a principled approach for measuring the ability of future methods for multi-concept control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18483v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Demographic Probing of Large Language Models Lacks Construct Validity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18486</link><description>arXiv:2601.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demographic probing is widely used to study how large language models (LLMs) adapt their behavior to signaled demographic attributes. This approach typically uses a single demographic cue in isolation (e.g., a name or dialect) as a signal for group membership, implicitly assuming strong construct validity: that such cues are interchangeable operationalizations of the same underlying, demographically conditioned behavior. We test this assumption in realistic advice-seeking interactions, focusing on race and gender in a U.S. context. We find that cues intended to represent the same demographic group induce only partially overlapping changes in model behavior, while differentiation between groups within a given cue is weak and uneven. Consequently, estimated disparities are unstable, with both magnitude and direction varying across cues. We further show that these inconsistencies partly arise from variation in how strongly cues encode demographic attributes and from linguistic confounders that independently shape model behavior. Together, our findings suggest that demographic probing lacks construct validity: it does not yield a single, stable characterization of how LLMs condition on demographic information, which may reflect a misspecified or fragmented construct. We conclude by recommending the use of multiple, ecologically valid cues and explicit control of confounders to support more defensible claims about demographic effects in LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18486v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgentDoG: A Diagnostic Guardrail Framework for AI Agent Safety and Security</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18491</link><description>arXiv:2601.18491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of AI agents introduces complex safety and security challenges arising from autonomous tool use and environmental interactions. Current guardrail models lack agentic risk awareness and transparency in risk diagnosis. To introduce an agentic guardrail that covers complex and numerous risky behaviors, we first propose a unified three-dimensional taxonomy that orthogonally categorizes agentic risks by their source (where), failure mode (how), and consequence (what). Guided by this structured and hierarchical taxonomy, we introduce a new fine-grained agentic safety benchmark (ATBench) and a Diagnostic Guardrail framework for agent safety and security (AgentDoG). AgentDoG provides fine-grained and contextual monitoring across agent trajectories. More Crucially, AgentDoG can diagnose the root causes of unsafe actions and seemingly safe but unreasonable actions, offering provenance and transparency beyond binary labels to facilitate effective agent alignment. AgentDoG variants are available in three sizes (4B, 7B, and 8B parameters) across Qwen and Llama model families. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AgentDoG achieves state-of-the-art performance in agentic safety moderation in diverse and complex interactive scenarios. All models and datasets are openly released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18491v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DV-VLN: Dual Verification for Reliable LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18492</link><description>arXiv:2601.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an embodied agent to navigate in a complex 3D environment according to natural language instructions. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled language-driven navigation with improved interpretability. However, most LLM-based agents still rely on single-shot action decisions, where the model must choose one option from noisy, textualized multi-perspective observations. Due to local mismatches and imperfect intermediate reasoning, such decisions can easily deviate from the correct path, leading to error accumulation and reduced reliability in unseen environments. In this paper, we propose DV-VLN, a new VLN framework that follows a generate-then-verify paradigm. DV-VLN first performs parameter-efficient in-domain adaptation of an open-source LLaMA-2 backbone to produce a structured navigational chain-of-thought, and then verifies candidate actions with two complementary channels: True-False Verification (TFV) and Masked-Entity Verification (MEV). DV-VLN selects actions by aggregating verification successes across multiple samples, yielding interpretable scores for reranking. Experiments on R2R, RxR (English subset), and REVERIE show that DV-VLN consistently improves over direct prediction and sampling-only baselines, achieving competitive performance among language-only VLN agents and promising results compared with several cross-modal systems.Code is available at https://github.com/PlumJun/DV-VLN.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18492v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DisasterInsight: A Multimodal Benchmark for Function-Aware and Grounded Disaster Assessment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18493</link><description>arXiv:2601.18493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely interpretation of satellite imagery is critical for disaster response, yet existing vision-language benchmarks for remote sensing largely focus on coarse labels and image-level recognition, overlooking the functional understanding and instruction robustness required in real humanitarian workflows. We introduce DisasterInsight, a multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on realistic disaster analysis tasks. DisasterInsight restructures the xBD dataset into approximately 112K building-centered instances and supports instruction-diverse evaluation across multiple tasks, including building-function classification, damage-level and disaster-type classification, counting, and structured report generation aligned with humanitarian assessment guidelines.
  To establish domain-adapted baselines, we propose DI-Chat, obtained by fine-tuning existing VLM backbones on disaster-specific instruction data using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art generic and remote-sensing VLMs reveal substantial performance gaps across tasks, particularly in damage understanding and structured report generation. DI-Chat achieves significant improvements on damage-level and disaster-type classification as well as report generation quality, while building-function classification remains challenging for all evaluated models. DisasterInsight provides a unified benchmark for studying grounded multimodal reasoning in disaster imagery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18493v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time Prediction of Lower Limb Joint Kinematics, Kinetics, and Ground Reaction Force using Wearable Sensors and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18494</link><description>arXiv:2601.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Walking is a key movement of interest in biomechanics, yet gold-standard data collection methods are time- and cost-expensive. This paper presents a real-time, multimodal, high sample rate lower-limb motion capture framework, based on wireless wearable sensors and machine learning algorithms. Random Forests are used to estimate joint angles from IMU data, and ground reaction force (GRF) is predicted from instrumented insoles, while joint moments are predicted from angles and GRF using deep learning based on the ResNet-16 architecture. All three models achieve good accuracy compared to literature, and the predictions are logged at 1 kHz with a minimal delay of 23 ms for 20s worth of input data. The present work fully relies on wearable sensors, covers all five major lower limb joints, and provides multimodal comprehensive estimations of GRF, joint angles, and moments with minimal delay suitable for biofeedback applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18494v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DEEPMED: Building a Medical DeepResearch Agent via Multi-hop Med-Search Data and Turn-Controlled Agentic Training &amp; Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18496</link><description>arXiv:2601.18496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical reasoning models remain constrained by parametric knowledge and are thus susceptible to forgetting and hallucinations. DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains. We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus "find it but fail to use it," leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth. For inference, we bring a monitor to help validate hypotheses within a controlled number of steps and avoid context rot. Overall, on seven medical benchmarks, DeepMed improves its base model by 9.79\% on average and outperforms larger medical reasoning and DR models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18496v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BAIT: Visual-illusion-inspired Privacy Preservation for Mobile Data Visualization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18497</link><description>arXiv:2601.18497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the prevalence of mobile data visualizations, there have been growing concerns about their privacy risks, especially shoulder surfing attacks. Inspired by prior research on visual illusion, we propose BAIT, a novel approach to automatically generate privacy-preserving visualizations by stacking a decoy visualization over a given visualization. It allows visualization owners at proximity to clearly discern the original visualization and makes shoulder surfers at a distance be misled by the decoy visualization, by adjusting different visual channels of a decoy visualization (e.g., shape, position, tilt, size, color and spatial frequency). We explicitly model human perception effect at different viewing distances to optimize the decoy visualization design. Privacy-preserving examples and two in-depth user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of BAIT in both controlled lab study and real-world scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18497v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nearly Optimal Bayesian Inference for Structural Missingness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18500</link><description>arXiv:2601.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural missingness breaks 'just impute and train': values can be undefined by causal or logical constraints, and the mask may depend on observed variables, unobserved variables (MNAR), and other missingness indicators. It simultaneously brings (i) a catch-22 situation with causal loop, prediction needs the missing features, yet inferring them depends on the missingness mechanism, (ii) under MNAR, the unseen are different, the missing part can come from a shifted distribution, and (iii) plug-in imputation, a single fill-in can lock in uncertainty and yield overconfident, biased decisions. In the Bayesian view, prediction via the posterior predictive distribution integrates over the full model posterior uncertainty, rather than relying on a single point estimate. This framework decouples (i) learning an in-model missing-value posterior from (ii) label prediction by optimizing the predictive posterior distribution, enabling posterior integration. This decoupling yields an in-model almost-free-lunch: once the posterior is learned, prediction is plug-and-play while preserving uncertainty propagation. It achieves SOTA on 43 classification and 15 imputation benchmarks, with finite-sample near Bayes-optimality guarantees under our SCM prior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18500v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conformal Prediction Algorithms for Time Series Forecasting: Methods and Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18509</link><description>arXiv:2601.18509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is of critical importance in time series forecasting, yet traditional methods often rely on restrictive distributional assumptions. Conformal prediction (CP) has emerged as a promising distribution-free framework for generating prediction intervals with rigorous theoretical guarantees. However, applying CP to sequential data presents a primary challenge: the temporal dependencies inherent in time series fundamentally violate the core assumption of data exchangeability, upon which standard CP guarantees are built. This review critically examines the main categories of algorithmic solutions designed to address this conflict. We survey and benchmark methods that relax the exchangeability assumption, those that redefine the data unit to be a collection of independent time series, approaches that explicitly model the dynamics of the prediction residuals, and online learning algorithms that adapt to distribution shifts to maintain long-run coverage. By synthesizing these approaches, we highlight computational efficiency and practical performance on real-world data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18509v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Just-In-Time Reinforcement Learning: Continual Learning in LLM Agents Without Gradient Updates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18510</link><description>arXiv:2601.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at general tasks, they inherently struggle with continual adaptation due to the frozen weights after deployment. Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution but incurs prohibitive computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. We introduce Just-In-Time Reinforcement Learning (JitRL), a training-free framework that enables test-time policy optimization without any gradient updates. JitRL maintains a dynamic, non-parametric memory of experiences and retrieves relevant trajectories to estimate action advantages on-the-fly. These estimates are then used to directly modulate the LLM's output logits. We theoretically prove that this additive update rule is the exact closed-form solution to the KL-constrained policy optimization objective. Extensive experiments on WebArena and Jericho demonstrate that JitRL establishes a new state-of-the-art among training-free methods. Crucially, JitRL outperforms the performance of computationally expensive fine-tuning methods (e.g., WebRL) while reducing monetary costs by over 30 times, offering a scalable path for continual learning agents. The code is available at https://github.com/liushiliushi/JitRL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18510v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling up Privacy-Preserving ML: A CKKS Implementation of Llama-2-7B</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18511</link><description>arXiv:2601.18511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, privacy concerns pertaining to inference inputs keep growing. In this context, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) has emerged as a primary cryptographic solution to provide non-interactive confidential LLM inference. Existing solutions scale poorly with the input token length, and hence focus either on small models or larger models with a small number of input tokens. They also suffer from the existence of large outlier values. These values have a strong impact on the evaluation of non-linear layers, leading to large-degree polynomial approximation and thus heavy evaluation costs.
  We propose an FHE-based private LLM inference solution that allows thousands of input tokens with only a part of them being encrypted: this fits with a scenario where the context is benign and only part of the input is sensitive. To do so, we suggest an unbalanced chunked prefill framework that processes the private and public parts of the input tokens differently. Our framework contains plaintext-plaintext, plaintext-ciphertext and ciphertext-ciphertext computational components. We adopt different strategies and ingredients for each component. We also devise new homomorphic algorithms for specific matrix multiplication and polynomial evaluation tasks encountered during LLM inference.
  Furthermore, without retraining, we tailor the LLM inference algorithm to reduce the ranges of outlier values: we leverage machine learning strategies (token prepending and rotations) to mitigate the impact of the outliers on non-linear layers.
  Based on these ingredients, we describe a CKKS-based end-to-end implementation of Llama-2-7B private inference for up to 4096 input tokens, of which the last 128 are encrypted. On a cluster of 8~NVIDIA RTX-4090 GPUs, inference takes 85s for summarization and 33s for generation per output token.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18511v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Using Large Language Models to Construct Virtual Top Managers: A Method for Organizational Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18512</link><description>arXiv:2601.18512v1 Announce Type: new

Across three phases, we assess construct validity, reliability, and behavioral fidelity by benchmarking these virtual CEOs against human participants. Our results indicate that theoretically scaffolded personas approximate the moral judgements observed in human samples, suggesting that LLM-based personas can serve as credible and complementary tools for organizational research in contexts where direct access to executives is limited. We conclude by outlining implications for future research using LLM-based personas in organizational settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18512v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LipNeXt: Scaling up Lipschitz-based Certified Robustness to Billion-parameter Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18513</link><description>arXiv:2601.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lipschitz-based certification offers efficient, deterministic robustness guarantees but has struggled to scale in model size, training efficiency, and ImageNet performance. We introduce \emph{LipNeXt}, the first \emph{constraint-free} and \emph{convolution-free} 1-Lipschitz architecture for certified robustness.

The full network uses orthogonal projections, spatial shifts, a simple 1-Lipschitz $\beta$-Abs nonlinearity, and $L_2$ spatial pooling to maintain tight Lipschitz control while enabling expressive feature mixing. Across CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet, LipNeXt achieves state-of-the-art clean and certified robust accuracy (CRA), and on ImageNet it scales to 1-2B large models, improving CRA over prior Lipschitz models (e.g., up to $+8\%$ at $\varepsilon{=}1$) while retaining efficient, stable low-precision training. These results demonstrate that Lipschitz-based certification can benefit from modern scaling trends without sacrificing determinism or efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18513v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ribbons from Independence Structure: Hypercontractivity, $\Phi$-Mutual Information, and Matrix $\Phi$-Entropy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18516</link><description>arXiv:2601.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hypercontractivity ribbon and the $\Phi$-ribbon for joint distributions that obey a given independence structure, obtaining tight bounds in some basic regimes. For general independence structures, modeled as a hypergraph whose hyperedges specify mutually independent subcollections of random variables, we provide an explicit inner bound on the $\Phi$-ribbon described by a simple convex hull of incidence vectors. We also provide a new multipartite generalization version and a $\Phi$-mutual information analogue of the Zhang--Yeung inequality, which implies nontrivial points in the hypercontractivity ribbon and the $\Phi$-ribbon respectively. Finally, we propose the matrix $\Phi$-ribbon based on matrix $\Phi$-entropy and establish the tensorization and data processing properties, together with the calculation of an exact matrix SDPI constant for the doubly symmetric binary source.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18516v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GenAI for Social Work Field Education: Client Simulation with Real-Time Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18517</link><description>arXiv:2601.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field education is the signature pedagogy of social work, yet providing timely and objective feedback during training is constrained by the availability of instructors and counseling clients. In this paper, we present SWITCH, the Social Work Interactive Training Chatbot. SWITCH integrates realistic client simulation, real-time counseling skill classification, and a Motivational Interviewing (MI) progression system into the training workflow. To model a client, SWITCH uses a cognitively grounded profile comprising static fields (e.g., background, beliefs) and dynamic fields (e.g., emotions, automatic thoughts, openness), allowing the agent's behavior to evolve throughout a session realistically. The skill classification module identifies the counseling skills from the user utterances, and feeds the result to the MI controller that regulates the MI stage transitions. To enhance classification accuracy, we study in-context learning with retrieval over annotated transcripts, and a fine-tuned BERT multi-label classifier. In the experiments, we demonstrated that both BERT-based approach and in-context learning outperforms the baseline with big margin. SWITCH thereby offers a scalable, low-cost, and consistent training workflow that complements field education, and allows supervisors to focus on higher-level mentorship.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18517v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A BFBt preconditioner for Double Saddle-Point Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18520</link><description>arXiv:2601.18520v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Urban bus transit agencies need reliable, network-wide delay predictions to provide accurate arrival information to passengers and support real-time operational control. Accurate predictions help passengers plan their trips, reduce waiting time, and allow operations staff to adjust headways, dispatch extra vehicles, and manage disruptions. Although real-time feeds such as GTFS-Realtime (GTFS-RT) are now widely available, most existing delay prediction systems handle only a few routes, depend on hand-crafted features, and offer little guidance on how to design a scalable, reusable architecture.
  We present a city-scale prediction pipeline that combines multi-resolution feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and deep learning. The framework generates 1,683 spatiotemporal features by exploring 23 aggregation combinations over H3 cells, routes, segments, and temporal patterns, and compresses them into 83 components using Adaptive PCA while preserving 95% of the variance. To avoid the "giant cluster" problem that occurs when dense urban areas fall into a single H3 region, we introduce a hybrid H3+topology clustering method that yields 12 balanced route clusters (coefficient of variation 0.608) and enables efficient distributed training.
  We compare five model architectures on six months of bus operations from the Soci\'et\'e de transport de Montr\'eal (STM) network in Montr\'eal. A global LSTM with cluster-aware features achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, outperforming transformer models by 18 to 52% while using 275 times fewer parameters. We also report multi-level evaluation at the elementary segment, segment, and trip level with walk-forward validation and latency analysis, showing that the proposed pipeline is suitable for real-time, city-scale deployment and can be reused for other networks with limited adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18521v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Human Labels to Literature: Semi-Supervised Learning of NMR Chemical Shifts at Scale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18524</link><description>arXiv:2601.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts is fundamental to spectral analysis and molecular structure elucidation, yet existing machine learning methods rely on limited, labor-intensive atom-assigned datasets. We propose a semi-supervised framework that learns NMR chemical shifts from millions of literature-extracted spectra without explicit atom-level assignments, integrating a small amount of labeled data with large-scale unassigned spectra. We formulate chemical shift prediction from literature spectra as a permutation-invariant set supervision problem, and show that under commonly satisfied conditions on the loss function, optimal bipartite matching reduces to a sorting-based loss, enabling stable large-scale semi-supervised training beyond traditional curated datasets. Our models achieve substantially improved accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art methods and exhibit stronger generalization on significantly larger and more diverse molecular datasets. Moreover, by incorporating solvent information at scale, our approach captures systematic solvent effects across common NMR solvents for the first time. Overall, our results demonstrate that large-scale unlabeled spectra mined from the literature can serve as a practical and effective data source for training NMR shift models, suggesting a broader role of literature-derived, weakly structured data in data-centric AI for science.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18524v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Closing the Modality Gap Aligns Group-Wise Semantics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18525</link><description>arXiv:2601.18525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multimodal learning, CLIP has been recognized as the \textit{de facto} method for learning a shared latent space across multiple modalities, placing similar representations close to each other and moving them away from dissimilar ones. Although CLIP-based losses effectively align modalities at the semantic level, the resulting latent spaces often remain only partially shared, revealing a structural mismatch known as the modality gap. While the necessity of addressing this phenomenon remains debated, particularly given its limited impact on instance-wise tasks (e.g., retrieval), we prove that its influence is instead strongly pronounced in group-level tasks (e.g., clustering). To support this claim, we introduce a novel method designed to consistently reduce this discrepancy in two-modal settings, with a straightforward extension to the general $n$-modal case. Through our extensive evaluation, we demonstrate our novel insight: while reducing the gap provides only marginal or inconsistent improvements in traditional instance-wise tasks, it significantly enhances group-wise tasks. These findings may reshape our understanding of the modality gap, highlighting its key role in improving performance on tasks requiring semantic grouping.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18525v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Fine-Tuning for In-Context Retrieval and Efficient KV-Caching in Long-Context Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18527</link><description>arXiv:2601.18527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With context windows of millions of tokens, Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can encode entire document collections, offering a strong alternative to conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, it remains unclear whether fine-tuning strategies can improve long-context performance and translate to greater robustness under KV-cache compression techniques. In this work, we investigate which training strategies most effectively enhance LCLMs' ability to identify and use relevant information, as well as enhancing their robustness under KV-cache compression. Our experiments show substantial in-domain improvements, achieving gains of up to +20 points over the base model. However, out-of-domain generalization remains task dependent with large variance -- LCLMs excels on finance questions (+9 points), while RAG shows stronger performance on multiple-choice questions (+6 points) over the baseline models. Finally, we show that our fine-tuning approaches bring moderate improvements in robustness under KV-cache compression, with gains varying across tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Cold Start to Active Learning: Embedding-Based Scan Selection for Medical Image Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18532</link><description>arXiv:2601.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation annotations are critical for disease monitoring, yet manual labeling remains a major bottleneck due to the time and expertise required. Active learning (AL) alleviates this burden by prioritizing informative samples for annotation, typically through a diversity-based cold-start phase followed by uncertainty-driven selection. We propose a novel cold-start sampling strategy that combines foundation-model embeddings with clustering, including automatic selection of the number of clusters and proportional sampling across clusters, to construct a diverse and representative initial training. This is followed by an uncertainty-based AL framework that integrates spatial diversity to guide sample selection. The proposed method is intuitive and interpretable, enabling visualization of the feature-space distribution of candidate samples. We evaluate our approach on three datasets spanning X-ray and MRI modalities. On the CheXmask dataset, the cold-start strategy outperforms random selection, improving Dice from 0.918 to 0.929 and reducing the Hausdorff distance from 32.41 to 27.66 mm. In the AL setting, combined entropy and diversity selection improves Dice from 0.919 to 0.939 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 30.10 to 19.16 mm. On the Montgomery dataset, cold-start gains are substantial, with Dice improving from 0.928 to 0.950 and Hausdorff distance decreasing from 14.22 to 9.38 mm. On the SynthStrip dataset, cold-start selection slightly affects Dice but reduces the Hausdorff distance from 9.43 to 8.69 mm, while active learning improves Dice from 0.816 to 0.826 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 7.76 to 6.38 mm. Overall, the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods in low-data regimes, improving segmentation accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18532v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Verifiable Dot to Reward Chain: Harnessing Verifiable Reference-based Rewards for Reinforcement Learning of Open-ended Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18533</link><description>arXiv:2601.18533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) succeeds in reasoning tasks (e.g., math and code) by checking the final verifiable answer (i.e., a verifiable dot signal). However, extending this paradigm to open-ended generation is challenging because there is no unambiguous ground truth. Relying on single-dot supervision often leads to inefficiency and reward hacking. To address these issues, we propose reinforcement learning with verifiable reference-based rewards (RLVRR). Instead of checking the final answer, RLVRR extracts an ordered linguistic signal from high-quality references (i.e, reward chain). Specifically, RLVRR decomposes rewards into two dimensions: content, which preserves deterministic core concepts (e.g., keywords), and style, which evaluates adherence to stylistic properties through LLM-based verification. In this way, RLVRR combines the exploratory strength of RL with the efficiency and reliability of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments on more than 10 benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models confirm the advantages of our approach. RLVRR (1) substantially outperforms SFT trained with ten times more data and advanced reward models, (2) unifies the training of structured reasoning and open-ended generation, and (3) generalizes more effectively while preserving output diversity. These results establish RLVRR as a principled and efficient path toward verifiable reinforcement learning for general-purpose LLM alignment.

Abstract: We present a novel metric for the evaluation of the morphological plausibility of subword segmentation.

These are available in resources such as Universal Dependencies or UniMorph for a much wider range of languages. The metric works by probabilistically aligning subwords with morphological features through an IBM Model 1. Our experiments show that the metric correlates well with traditional morpheme boundary recall while being more broadly applicable across languages with different morphological systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18536v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GenAgent: Scaling Text-to-Image Generation via Agentic Multimodal Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18543</link><description>arXiv:2601.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GenAgent, unifying visual understanding and generation through an agentic multimodal model. Unlike unified models that face expensive training costs and understanding-generation trade-offs, GenAgent decouples these capabilities through an agentic framework: understanding is handled by the multimodal model itself, while generation is achieved by treating image generation models as invokable tools. Crucially, unlike existing modular systems constrained by static pipelines, this design enables autonomous multi-turn interactions where the agent generates multimodal chains-of-thought encompassing reasoning, tool invocation, judgment, and reflection to iteratively refine outputs. We employ a two-stage training strategy: first, cold-start with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality tool invocation and reflection data to bootstrap agent behaviors; second, end-to-end agentic reinforcement learning combining pointwise rewards (final image quality) and pairwise rewards (reflection accuracy), with trajectory resampling for enhanced multi-turn exploration. GenAgent significantly boosts base generator(FLUX.1-dev) performance on GenEval++ (+23.6\%) and WISE (+14\%). Beyond performance gains, our framework demonstrates three key properties: 1) cross-tool generalization to generators with varying capabilities, 2) test-time scaling with consistent improvements across interaction rounds, and 3) task-adaptive reasoning that automatically adjusts to different tasks.

Abstract: To expedite space exploration on Mars, it is indispensable to develop an efficient Martian image compression method for transmitting images through the constrained Mars-to-Earth communication channel. Although the existing learned compression methods have achieved promising results for natural images from earth, there remain two critical issues that hinder their effectiveness for Martian image compression: 1) They overlook the highly-limited computational resources on Mars; 2) They do not utilize the strong \textit{inter-image} similarities across Martian images to advance image compression performance. Motivated by our empirical analysis of the strong \textit{intra-} and \textit{inter-image} similarities from the perspective of texture, color, and semantics, we propose a reference-based Martian asymmetrical image compression (REMAC) approach, which shifts computational complexity from the encoder to the resource-rich decoder and simultaneously improves compression performance. To leverage \textit{inter-image} similarities, we propose a reference-guided entropy module and a ref-decoder that utilize useful information from reference images, reducing redundant operations at the encoder and achieving superior compression performance. To exploit \textit{intra-image} similarities, the ref-decoder adopts a deep, multi-scale architecture with enlarged receptive field size to model long-range spatial dependencies. Additionally, we develop a latent feature recycling mechanism to further alleviate the extreme computational constraints on Mars. Experimental results show that REMAC reduces encoder complexity by 43.51\% compared to the state-of-the-art method, while achieving a BD-PSNR gain of 0.2664 dB.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18547v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast and Safe Trajectory Optimization for Mobile Manipulators With Neural Configuration Space Distance Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18548</link><description>arXiv:2601.18548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile manipulators promise agile, long-horizon behavior by coordinating base and arm motion, yet whole-body trajectory optimization in cluttered, confined spaces remains difficult due to high-dimensional nonconvexity and the need for fast, accurate collision reasoning. Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDF) enable fixed-base manipulators to model collisions directly in configuration space via smooth, implicit distances. This representation holds strong potential to bypass the nonlinear configuration-to-workspace mapping while preserving accurate whole-body geometry and providing optimization-friendly collision costs. Yet, extending this capability to mobile manipulators is hindered by unbounded workspaces and tighter base-arm coupling. We lift this promise to mobile manipulation with Generalized Configuration Space Distance Fields (GCDF), extending CDF to robots with both translational and rotational joints in unbounded workspaces with tighter base-arm coupling. We prove that GCDF preserves Euclidean-like local distance structure and accurately encodes whole-body geometry in configuration space, and develop a data generation and training pipeline that yields continuous neural GCDFs with accurate values and gradients, supporting efficient GPU-batched queries. Building on this representation, we develop a high-performance sequential convex optimization framework centered on GCDF-based collision reasoning. The solver scales to large numbers of implicit constraints through (i) online specification of neural constraints, (ii) sparsity-aware active-set detection with parallel batched evaluation across thousands of constraints, and (iii) incremental constraint management for rapid replanning under scene changes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18548v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unknown Unknowns: Why Hidden Intentions in LLMs Evade Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18552</link><description>arXiv:2601.18552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are increasingly embedded in everyday decision-making, yet their outputs can encode subtle, unintended behaviours that shape user beliefs and actions. We refer to these covert, goal-directed behaviours as hidden intentions, which may arise from training and optimisation artefacts, or be deliberately induced by an adversarial developer, yet remain difficult to detect in practice. We introduce a taxonomy of ten categories of hidden intentions, grounded in social science research and organised by intent, mechanism, context, and impact, shifting attention from surface-level behaviours to design-level strategies of influence. We show how hidden intentions can be easily induced in controlled models, providing both testbeds for evaluation and demonstrations of potential misuse. We systematically assess detection methods, including reasoning and non-reasoning LLM judges, and find that detection collapses in realistic open-world settings, particularly under low-prevalence conditions, where false positives overwhelm precision and false negatives conceal true risks. Stress tests on precision-prevalence and precision-FNR trade-offs reveal why auditing fails without vanishingly small false positive rates or strong priors on manipulation types. Finally, a qualitative case study shows that all ten categories manifest in deployed, state-of-the-art LLMs, emphasising the urgent need for robust frameworks. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of detectability failures of hidden intentions in LLMs under open-world settings, offering a foundation for understanding, inducing, and stress-testing such behaviours, and establishing a flexible taxonomy for anticipating evolving threats and informing governance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18552v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deconstructing Instruction-Following: A New Benchmark for Granular Evaluation of Large Language Model Instruction Compliance Abilities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18554</link><description>arXiv:2601.18554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliably ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) follow complex instructions is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks often fail to reflect real-world use or isolate compliance from task success. We introduce MOSAIC (MOdular Synthetic Assessment of Instruction Compliance), a modular framework that uses a dynamically generated dataset with up to 20 application-oriented generation constraints to enable a granular and independent analysis of this capability. Our evaluation of five LLMs from different families based on this new benchmark demonstrates that compliance is not a monolithic capability but varies significantly with constraint type, quantity, and position. The analysis reveals model-specific weaknesses, uncovers synergistic and conflicting interactions between instructions, and identifies distinct positional biases such as primacy and recency effects. These granular insights are critical for diagnosing model failures and developing more reliable LLMs for systems that demand strict adherence to complex instructions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18554v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Discrimination for Medical Image Diagnosis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18556</link><description>arXiv:2601.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biomedical engineering, artificial intelligence has become a pivotal tool for enhancing medical diagnostics, particularly in medical image classification tasks such as detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays and breast cancer screening. However, real-world medical datasets frequently exhibit severe class imbalance, where positive samples substantially outnumber negative samples, leading to biased models with low recall rates for minority classes. This imbalance not only compromises diagnostic accuracy but also poses clinical misdiagnosis risks. To address this challenge, we propose SDA-QEC (Simplified Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Classification), an innovative framework that integrates simplified diffusion-based data augmentation with quantum-enhanced feature discrimination. Our approach employs a lightweight diffusion augmentor to generate high-quality synthetic samples for minority classes, rebalancing the training distribution. Subsequently, a quantum feature layer embedded within MobileNetV2 architecture enhances the model's discriminative capability through high-dimensional feature mapping in Hilbert space. Comprehensive experiments on coronary angiography image classification demonstrate that SDA-QEC achieves 98.33% accuracy, 98.78% AUC, and 98.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming classical baselines including ResNet18, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and VGG16. Notably, our framework simultaneously attains 98.33% sensitivity and 98.33% specificity, achieving a balanced performance critical for clinical deployment. The proposed method validates the feasibility of integrating generative augmentation with quantum-enhanced modeling in real-world medical imaging tasks, offering a novel research pathway for developing highly reliable medical AI systems in small-sample, highly imbalanced, and high-risk diagnostic scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18556v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-enabled Satellite Edge Computing: A Single-Pixel Feature based Shallow Classification Model for Hyperspectral Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18560</link><description>arXiv:2601.18560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the important component of the Earth observation system, hyperspectral imaging satellites provide high-fidelity and enriched information for the formulation of related policies due to the powerful spectral measurement capabilities. However, the transmission speed of the satellite downlink has become a major bottleneck in certain applications, such as disaster monitoring and emergency mapping, which demand a fast response ability. We propose an efficient AI-enabled Satellite Edge Computing paradigm for hyperspectral image classification, facilitating the satellites to attain autonomous decision-making. To accommodate the resource constraints of satellite platforms, the proposed method adopts a lightweight, non-deep learning framework integrated with a few-shot learning strategy. Moreover, onboard processing on satellites could be faced with sensor failure and scan pattern errors, which result in degraded image quality with bad/misaligned pixels and mixed noise. To address these challenges, we develop a novel two-stage pixel-wise label propagation scheme that utilizes only intrinsic spectral features at the single pixel level without the necessity to consider spatial structural information as requested by deep neural networks. In the first stage, initial pixel labels are obtained by propagating selected anchor labels through the constructed anchor-pixel affinity matrix. Subsequently, a top-k pruned sparse graph is generated by directly computing pixel-level similarities. In the second stage, a closed-form solution derived from the sparse graph is employed to replace iterative computations. Furthermore, we developed a rank constraint-based graph clustering algorithm to determine the anchor labels.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18560v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An LLM-Agent-Based Framework for Age of Information Optimization in Heterogeneous Random Access Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18563</link><description>arXiv:2601.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and heterogeneous wireless networks, the Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric for evaluating the performance of real-time and personalized systems. While AoI-based random access is essential for next-generation applications such as the low-altitude economy and indoor service robots, existing strategies, ranging from rule-based protocols to learning-based methods, face critical challenges, including idealized model assumptions, slow convergence, and poor generalization. In this article, we propose Reflex-Core, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) agent-based framework for AoI-driven random access in heterogeneous networks. By devising an "Observe-Reflect-Decide-Execute" closed-loop mechanism, this framework integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to enable optimal, autonomous access control. Based on the Reflex-Core framework, we develop a Reflexive Multiple Access (RMA) protocol and a priority-based RMA variant for intelligent access control under different heterogeneous network settings. Experimental results demonstrate that in the investigated scenarios, the RMA protocol achieves up to a 14.9% reduction in average AoI compared with existing baselines, while the priority-based version improves the convergence rate by approximately 20%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18563v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Unsupervised Tensor-Based Domain Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18564</link><description>arXiv:2601.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a tensor-based domain alignment (DA) algorithm designed to align source and target tensors within an invariant subspace through the use of alignment matrices. These matrices along with the subspace undergo iterative optimization of which constraint is on oblique manifold, which offers greater flexibility and adaptability compared to the traditional Stiefel manifold. Moreover, regularization terms defined to preserve the variance of both source and target tensors, ensures robust performance. Our framework is versatile, effectively generalizing existing tensor-based DA methods as special cases. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances DA conversion speed but also significantly boosts classification accuracy. This positions our method as superior to current state-of-the-art techniques, making it a preferable choice for complex domain adaptation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18564v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Attention-Based Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter for Legged Robot State Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18569</link><description>arXiv:2601.18569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an Attention-Based Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (AttenNKF) for state estimation in legged robots. Foot slip is a major source of estimation error: when slip occurs, kinematic measurements violate the no-slip assumption and inject bias during the update step. Our objective is to estimate this slip-induced error and compensate for it. To this end, we augment an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) with a neural compensator that uses an attention mechanism to infer error conditioned on foot-slip severity and then applies this estimate as a post-update compensation to the InEKF state (i.e., after the filter update). The compensator is trained in a latent space, which aims to reduce sensitivity to raw input scales and encourages structured slip-conditioned compensations, while preserving the InEKF recursion. Experiments demonstrate improved performance compared to existing legged-robot state estimators, particularly under slip-prone conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18569v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feature-Indexed Federated Recommendation with Residual-Quantized Codebooks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18570</link><description>arXiv:2601.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated recommendation provides a privacy-preserving solution for training recommender systems without centralizing user interactions. However, existing methods follow an ID-indexed communication paradigm that transmit whole item embeddings between clients and the server, which has three major limitations: 1) consumes uncontrollable communication resources, 2) the uploaded item information cannot generalize to related non-interacted items, and 3) is sensitive to client noisy feedback. To solve these problems, it is necessary to fundamentally change the existing ID-indexed communication paradigm. Therefore, we propose a feature-indexed communication paradigm that transmits feature code embeddings as codebooks rather than raw item embeddings. Building on this paradigm, we present RQFedRec, which assigns each item a list of discrete code IDs via Residual Quantization (RQ)-Kmeans. Each client generates and trains code embeddings as codebooks based on discrete code IDs provided by the server, and the server collects and aggregates these codebooks rather than item embeddings. This design makes communication controllable since the codebooks could cover all items, enabling updates to propagate across related items in same code ID. In addition, since code embedding represents many items, which is more robust to a single noisy item. To jointly capture semantic and collaborative information, RQFedRec further adopts a collaborative-semantic dual-channel aggregation with a curriculum strategy that emphasizes semantic codes early and gradually increases the contribution of collaborative codes over training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that RQFedRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art federated recommendation baselines while significantly reducing communication overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18570v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One Persona, Many Cues, Different Results: How Sociodemographic Cues Impact LLM Personalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18572</link><description>arXiv:2601.18572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalization of LLMs by sociodemographic subgroup often improves user experience, but can also introduce or amplify biases and unfair outcomes across groups. Prior work has employed so-called personas, sociodemographic user attributes conveyed to a model, to study bias in LLMs by relying on a single cue to prompt a persona, such as user names or explicit attribute mentions. This disregards LLM sensitivity to prompt variations (robustness) and the rarity of some cues in real interactions (external validity). We compare six commonly used persona cues across seven open and proprietary LLMs on four writing and advice tasks. While cues are overall highly correlated, they produce substantial variance in responses across personas. We therefore caution against claims from a single persona cue and recommend future personalization research to evaluate multiple externally valid cues.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18572v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stable Matching with Deviators and Conformists</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18573</link><description>arXiv:2601.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fundamental Stable Marriage and Stable Roommates problems, there are inherent trade-offs between the size and stability of solutions. While in the former problem, a stable matching always exists and can be found efficiently using the celebrated Gale-Shapley algorithm, the existence of a stable matching is not guaranteed in the latter problem, but can be determined efficiently using Irving's algorithm. However, the computation of matchings that minimise the instability, either due to the presence of additional constraints on the size of the matching or due to restrictive preference cycles, gives rise to a collection of infamously intractable almost-stable matching problems. In practice, however, not every agent is able or likely to initiate deviations caused by blocking pairs. Suppose we knew, for example, due to a set of requirements or estimates based on historical data, which agents are likely to initiate deviations - the deviators - and which are likely to comply with whatever matching they are presented with - the conformists. Can we decide efficiently whether a matching exists in which no deviator is blocking, i.e., in which no deviator has an incentive to initiate a deviation? Furthermore, can we find matchings in which only a few deviators are blocking? We characterise the computational complexity of this question in bipartite and non-bipartite preference settings. Surprisingly, these problems prove computationally intractable in strong ways: for example, unlike in the classical setting, where every agent is considered a deviator, in this extension, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether a matching exists where no deviator is blocking. On the positive side, we identify polynomial-time and fixed-parameter tractable cases, providing novel algorithmics for multi-agent systems where stability cannot be fully guaranteed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18573v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Moving sample method for solving time-dependent partial differential equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18575</link><description>arXiv:2601.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit sharp gradients or local singularities is computationally demanding, as traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often suffer from inefficient point allocation that wastes resources on regions already well-resolved. This paper presents an adaptive sampling framework for PINNs aimed at efficiently solving time-dependent partial differential equations with pronounced local singularities. The method employs a residual-driven strategy, where the spatial-temporal distribution of training points is iteratively updated according to the error field from the previous iteration. This targeted allocation enables the network to concentrate computational effort on regions with significant residuals, achieving higher accuracy with fewer sampling points compared to uniform sampling. Numerical experiments on representative PDE benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach improves solution quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18575v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Refining Video Sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18577</link><description>arXiv:2601.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern video generators still struggle with complex physical dynamics, often falling short of physical realism. Existing approaches address this using external verifiers or additional training on augmented data, which is computationally expensive and still limited in capturing fine-grained motion. In this work, we present self-refining video sampling, a simple method that uses a pre-trained video generator trained on large-scale datasets as its own self-refiner. By interpreting the generator as a denoising autoencoder, we enable iterative inner-loop refinement at inference time without any external verifier or additional training. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware refinement strategy that selectively refines regions based on self-consistency, which prevents artifacts caused by over-refinement. Experiments on state-of-the-art video generators demonstrate significant improvements in motion coherence and physics alignment, achieving over 70\% human preference compared to the default sampler and guidance-based sampler.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18577v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FastInsight: Fast and Insightful Retrieval via Fusion Operators for Graph RAG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18579</link><description>arXiv:2601.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Graph RAG methods aiming for insightful retrieval on corpus graphs typically rely on time-intensive processes that interleave Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning. To enable time-efficient insightful retrieval, we propose FastInsight. We first introduce a graph retrieval taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three fundamental operations: vector search, graph search, and model-based search. Through this taxonomy, we identify two critical limitations in current approaches: the topology-blindness of model-based search and the semantics-blindness of graph search. FastInsight overcomes these limitations by interleaving two novel fusion operators: the Graph-based Reranker (GRanker), which functions as a graph model-based search, and Semantic-Topological eXpansion (STeX), which operates as a vector-graph search. Extensive experiments on broad retrieval and generation datasets demonstrate that FastInsight significantly improves both retrieval accuracy and generation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a substantial Pareto improvement in the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18579v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] K-Myriad: Jump-starting reinforcement learning with unsupervised parallel agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18580</link><description>arXiv:2601.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallelization in Reinforcement Learning is typically employed to speed up the training of a single policy, where multiple workers collect experience from an identical sampling distribution. This common design limits the potential of parallelization by neglecting the advantages of diverse exploration strategies. We propose K-Myriad, a scalable and unsupervised method that maximizes the collective state entropy induced by a population of parallel policies. By cultivating a portfolio of specialized exploration strategies, K-Myriad provides a robust initialization for Reinforcement Learning, leading to both higher training efficiency and the discovery of heterogeneous solutions. Experiments on high-dimensional continuous control tasks, with large-scale parallelization, demonstrate that K-Myriad can learn a broad set of distinct policies, highlighting its effectiveness for collective exploration and paving the way towards novel parallelization strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18580v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Classification to Ranking: Enhancing LLM Reasoning Capabilities for MBTI Personality Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18582</link><description>arXiv:2601.18582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personality detection aims to measure an individual's corresponding personality traits through their social media posts. The advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer novel perspectives for personality detection tasks. Existing approaches enhance personality trait analysis by leveraging LLMs to extract semantic information from textual posts as prompts, followed by training classifiers for categorization. However, accurately classifying personality traits remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of human personality and subtle inter-trait distinctions. Moreover, prompt-based methods often exhibit excessive dependency on expert-crafted knowledge without autonomous pattern-learning capacity. To address these limitations, we view personality detection as a ranking task rather than a classification and propose a corresponding reinforcement learning training paradigm. First, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish personality trait ranking capabilities while enforcing standardized output formats, creating a robust initialization. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a specialized ranking-based reward function. Unlike verification tasks with definitive solutions, personality assessment involves subjective interpretations and blurred boundaries between trait categories. Our reward function explicitly addresses this challenge by training LLMs to learn optimal answer rankings. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple personality detection benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18582v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GimmBO: Interactive Generative Image Model Merging via Bayesian Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18585</link><description>arXiv:2601.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning-based adaptation is widely used to customize diffusion-based image generation, leading to large collections of community-created adapters that capture diverse subjects and styles. Adapters derived from the same base model can be merged with weights, enabling the synthesis of new visual results within a vast and continuous design space. To explore this space, current workflows rely on manual slider-based tuning, an approach that scales poorly and makes weight selection difficult, even when the candidate set is limited to 20-30 adapters. We propose GimmBO to support interactive exploration of adapter merging for image generation through Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO). Motivated by observations from real-world usage, including sparsity and constrained weight ranges, we introduce a two-stage BO backend that improves sampling efficiency and convergence in high-dimensional spaces. We evaluate our approach with simulated users and a user study, demonstrating improved convergence, high success rates, and consistent gains over BO and line-search baselines, and further show the flexibility of the framework through several extensions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18585v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning long term climate-resilient transport adaptation pathways under direct and indirect flood impacts using reinforcement learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18586</link><description>arXiv:2601.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is expected to intensify rainfall and other hazards, increasing disruptions in urban transportation systems. Designing effective adaptation strategies is challenging due to the long-term, sequential nature of infrastructure investments, deep uncertainty, and complex cross-sector interactions. We propose a generic decision-support framework that couples an integrated assessment model (IAM) with reinforcement learning (RL) to learn adaptive, multi-decade investment pathways under uncertainty. The framework combines long-term climate projections (e.g., IPCC scenario pathways) with models that map projected extreme-weather drivers (e.g. rain) into hazard likelihoods (e.g. flooding), propagate hazards into urban infrastructure impacts (e.g. transport disruption), and value direct and indirect consequences for service performance and societal costs. Embedded in a reinforcement-learning loop, it learns adaptive climate adaptation policies that trade off investment and maintenance expenditures against avoided impacts. In collaboration with Copenhagen Municipality, we demonstrate the approach on pluvial flooding in the inner city for the horizon of 2024 to 2100. The learned strategies yield coordinated spatial-temporal pathways and improved robustness relative to conventional optimization baselines, namely inaction and random action, illustrating the framework's transferability to other hazards and cities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18586v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stability as a Liability:Systematic Breakdown of Linguistic Structure in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18588</link><description>arXiv:2601.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training stability is typically regarded as a prerequisite for reliable optimization in large language models. In this work, we analyze how stabilizing training dynamics affects the induced generation distribution. We show that under standard maximum likelihood training, stable parameter trajectories lead stationary solutions to approximately minimize the forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, while implicitly reducing generative entropy. As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds. It indicates that optimization stability and generative expressivity are not inherently aligned, and that stability alone is an insufficient indicator of generative quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18588v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AGSP-DSA: An Adaptive Graph Signal Processing Framework for Robust Multimodal Fusion with Dynamic Semantic Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18589</link><description>arXiv:2601.18589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an Adaptive Graph Signal Processing with Dynamic Semantic Alignment (AGSP DSA) framework to perform robust multimodal data fusion over heterogeneous sources, including text, audio, and images. The requested approach uses a dual-graph construction to learn both intra-modal and inter-modal relations, spectral graph filtering to boost the informative signals, and effective node embedding with Multi-scale Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Semantic aware attention mechanism: each modality may dynamically contribute to the context with respect to contextual relevance. The experimental outcomes on three benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSEI, AVE, and MM-IMDB, show that AGSP-DSA performs as the state of the art. More precisely, it achieves 95.3% accuracy, 0.936 F1-score, and 0.924 mAP on CMU-MOSEI, improving MM-GNN by 2.6 percent in accuracy. It gets 93.4% accuracy and 0.911 F1-score on AVE and 91.8% accuracy and 0.886 F1-score on MM-IMDB, which demonstrate good generalization and robustness in the missing modality setting. These findings verify the efficiency of AGSP-DSA in promoting multimodal learning in sentiment analysis, event recognition and multimedia classification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improvement of the Gilbert-Varshamov Bound for Linear Codes and Quantum Codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18590</link><description>arXiv:2601.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gilbert--Varshamov (GV) bound is a central benchmark in coding theory, establishing existential guarantees for error-correcting codes and serving as a baseline for both Hamming and quantum fault-tolerant information processing. Despite decades of effort, improving the GV bound is notoriously difficult, and known improvements often rely on technically heavy arguments and do not extend naturally to the quantum setting due to additional self-orthogonality constraints.
  In this work we develop a concise probabilistic method that yields an improvement over the classical GV bound for $q$-ary linear codes. For relative distance $\delta=d/n&lt;1-1/q$, we show that an $[n,k,d]_q$ linear code exists whenever $\frac{q^{k}-1}{q-1}\;&lt;\;\frac{c_\delta \sqrt{n}\, q^{n}}{\mathrm{Vol}_q(n,d-1)}$, for positive constant $c_\delta$ depending only on $\delta$, where $\mathrm{Vol}_q(n,d-1)$ denotes the volume of a $q$-ary Hamming ball.
  We further adapt this approach to the quantum setting by analyzing symplectic self-orthogonal structures. For $\delta&lt;1-1/q^2$, we obtain an improved quantum GV bound: there exists a $q$-ary quantum code $[[n,\,n-k,\,d]]$ provided that $\frac{q^{2n-k}-1}{q-1}&lt;\frac{c_\delta \sqrt{n}\cdot q^{2n}}{\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\binom{n}{i}(q^2-1)^i}$. In particular, our result improves the standard quantum GV bound by an $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ multiplicative factor.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18590v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How are MLOps Frameworks Used in Open Source Projects?

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) Operations (MLOps) frameworks have been conceived to support developers and AI engineers in managing the lifecycle of their ML models. While such frameworks provide a wide range of features, developers may leverage only a subset of them, while missing some highly desired features. This paper investigates the practical use and desired feature enhancements of eight popular open-source MLOps frameworks. Specifically, we analyze their usage by dependent projects on GitHub, examining how they invoke the frameworks' APIs and commands. Then, we qualitatively analyze feature requests and enhancements mined from the frameworks' issue trackers, relating these desired improvements to the previously identified usage features. Results indicate that MLOps frameworks are rarely used out-of-the-box and are infrequently integrated into GitHub Workflows, but rather, developers use their APIs to implement custom functionality in their projects. Used features concern core ML phases and whole infrastructure governance, sometimes leveraging multiple frameworks with complementary features. The mapping with feature requests highlights that users mainly ask for enhancements to core features of the frameworks, but also better API exposure and CI/CD integration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18591v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Balanced Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Commonsense Abductive Logic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18595</link><description>arXiv:2601.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive formal reasoning abilities, they often break down when problems require complex proof planning. One promising approach for improving LLM reasoning abilities involves translating problems into formal logic and using a logic solver. Although off-the-shelf logic solvers are in principle substantially more efficient than LLMs at logical reasoning, they assume that all relevant facts are provided in a question and are unable to deal with missing commonsense relations. In this work, we propose a novel method that uses feedback from the logic solver to augment a logic problem with commonsense relations provided by the LLM, in an iterative manner. This involves a search procedure through potential commonsense assumptions to maximize the chance of finding useful facts while keeping cost tractable. On a collection of pure-logical reasoning datasets, from which some commonsense information has been removed, our method consistently achieves considerable improvements over existing techniques, demonstrating the value in balancing neural and symbolic elements when working in human contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18595v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EFSI-DETR: Efficient Frequency-Semantic Integration for Real-Time Small Object Detection in UAV Imagery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18597</link><description>arXiv:2601.18597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time small object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery remains challenging due to limited feature representation and ineffective multi-scale fusion. Existing methods underutilize frequency information and rely on static convolutional operations, which constrain the capacity to obtain rich feature representations and hinder the effective exploitation of deep semantic features. To address these issues, we propose EFSI-DETR, a novel detection framework that integrates efficient semantic feature enhancement with dynamic frequency-spatial guidance. EFSI-DETR comprises two main components: (1) a Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Unified Synergy Network (DyFusNet) that jointly exploits frequency and spatial cues for robust multi-scale feature fusion, (2) an Efficient Semantic Feature Concentrator (ESFC) that enables deep semantic extraction with minimal computational cost. Furthermore, a Fine-grained Feature Retention (FFR) strategy is adopted to incorporate spatially rich shallow features during fusion to preserve fine-grained details, crucial for small object detection in UAV imagery. Extensive experiments on VisDrone and CODrone benchmarks demonstrate that our EFSI-DETR achieves the state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency, yielding improvement of \textbf{1.6}\% and \textbf{5.8}\% in AP and AP$_{s}$ on VisDrone, while obtaining \textbf{188} FPS inference speed on a single RTX 4090 GPU.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18597v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LaCoGSEA: Unsupervised deep learning for pathway analysis via latent correlation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18604</link><description>arXiv:2601.18604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Pathway enrichment analysis is widely used to interpret gene expression data. Standard approaches, such as GSEA, rely on predefined phenotypic labels and pairwise comparisons, which limits their applicability in unsupervised settings. Existing unsupervised extensions, including single-sample methods, provide pathway-level summaries but primarily capture linear relationships and do not explicitly model gene-pathway associations. More recently, deep learning models have been explored to capture non-linear transcriptomic structure. However, their interpretation has typically relied on generic explainable AI (XAI) techniques designed for feature-level attribution. As these methods are not designed for pathway-level interpretation in unsupervised transcriptomic analyses, their effectiveness in this setting remains limited.
  Results: To bridge this gap, we introduce LaCoGSEA (Latent Correlation GSEA), an unsupervised framework that integrates deep representation learning with robust pathway statistics. LaCoGSEA employs an autoencoder to capture non-linear manifolds and proposes a global gene-latent correlation metric as a proxy for differential expression, generating dense gene rankings without prior labels. We demonstrate that LaCoGSEA offers three key advantages: (i) it achieves improved clustering performance in distinguishing cancer subtypes compared to existing unsupervised baselines; (ii) it recovers a broader range of biologically meaningful pathways at higher ranks compared with linear dimensionality reduction and gradient-based XAI methods; and (iii) it maintains high robustness and consistency across varying experimental protocols and dataset sizes. Overall, LaCoGSEA provides state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised pathway enrichment analysis.

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a central game-theoretic tool in explainable AI (XAI). However, computing Shapley values exactly requires $2^d$ game evaluations for a model with $d$ features. Lundberg and Lee's KernelSHAP algorithm has emerged as a leading method for avoiding this exponential cost. KernelSHAP approximates Shapley values by approximating the game as a linear function, which is fit using a small number of game evaluations for random feature subsets.
  In this work, we extend KernelSHAP by approximating the game via higher degree polynomials, which capture non-linear interactions between features. Our resulting PolySHAP method yields empirically better Shapley value estimates for various benchmark datasets, and we prove that these estimates are consistent.
  Moreover, we connect our approach to paired sampling (antithetic sampling), a ubiquitous modification to KernelSHAP that improves empirical accuracy. We prove that paired sampling outputs exactly the same Shapley value approximations as second-order PolySHAP, without ever fitting a degree 2 polynomial. To the best of our knowledge, this finding provides the first strong theoretical justification for the excellent practical performance of the paired sampling heuristic.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18608v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Privacy-Preserving Entity Resolution with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18612</link><description>arXiv:2601.18612v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven model for solving the inverse problem of electrocardiography, the mathematical problem that forms the basis of electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI). We present a conditional diffusion framework that learns a probabilistic mapping from noisy body surface signals to heart surface electric potentials. The proposed approach leverages the generative nature of diffusion models to capture the non-unique and underdetermined nature of the ECGI inverse problem, enabling probabilistic sampling of multiple reconstructions rather than a single deterministic estimate. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed framework is geometry-free and purely data-driven, alleviating the need for patient-specific mesh construction. We evaluate the method on a real ECGI dataset and compare it against strong deterministic baselines, including a convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and transformer-based model. The results demonstrate that the proposed diffusion approach achieves improved reconstruction accuracy, highlighting the potential of diffusion models as a robust tool for noninvasive cardiac electrophysiology imaging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18615v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of Phonemic, Syntactic, and Semantic Representations in Artificial Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18617</link><description>arXiv:2601.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During language acquisition, children successively learn to categorize phonemes, identify words, and combine them with syntax to form new meaning. While the development of this behavior is well characterized, we still lack a unifying computational framework to explain its underlying neural representations. Here, we investigate whether and when phonemic, lexical, and syntactic representations emerge in the activations of artificial neural networks during their training. Our results show that both speech- and text-based models follow a sequence of learning stages: during training, their neural activations successively build subspaces, where the geometry of the neural activations represents phonemic, lexical, and syntactic structure. While this developmental trajectory qualitatively relates to children's, it is quantitatively different: These algorithms indeed require two to four orders of magnitude more data for these neural representations to emerge. Together, these results show conditions under which major stages of language acquisition spontaneously emerge, and hence delineate a promising path to understand the computations underpinning language acquisition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18617v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scale-Aware Self-Supervised Learning for Segmentation of Small and Sparse Structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18619</link><description>arXiv:2601.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful strategy for representation learning under limited annotation regimes, yet its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to many factors, especially the nature of the target task. In segmentation, existing pipelines are typically tuned to large, homogeneous regions, but their performance drops when objects are small, sparse, or locally irregular. In this work, we propose a scale-aware SSL adaptation that integrates small-window cropping into the augmentation pipeline, zooming in on fine-scale structures during pretraining. We evaluate this approach across two domains with markedly different data modalities: seismic imaging, where the goal is to segment sparse faults, and neuroimaging, where the task is to delineate small cellular structures. In both settings, our method yields consistent improvements over standard and state-of-the-art baselines under label constraints, improving accuracy by up to 13% for fault segmentation and 5% for cell delineation. In contrast, large-scale features such as seismic facies or tissue regions see little benefit, underscoring that the value of SSL depends critically on the scale of the target objects. Our findings highlight the need to align SSL design with object size and sparsity, offering a general principle for buil ding more effective representation learning pipelines across scientific imaging domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18619v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CASSANDRA: Programmatic and Probabilistic Learning and Inference for Stochastic World Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18620</link><description>arXiv:2601.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building world models is essential for planning in real-world domains such as businesses. Since such domains have rich semantics, we can leverage world knowledge to effectively model complex action effects and causal relationships from limited data. In this work, we propose CASSANDRA, a neurosymbolic world modeling approach that leverages an LLM as a knowledge prior to construct lightweight transition models for planning. CASSANDRA integrates two components: (1) LLM-synthesized code to model deterministic features, and (2) LLM-guided structure learning of a probabilistic graphical model to capture causal relationships among stochastic variables. We evaluate CASSANDRA in (i) a small-scale coffee-shop simulator and (ii) a complex theme park business simulator, where we demonstrate significant improvements in transition prediction and planning over baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18620v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Brazilian Social Media Anti-vaccine Information Disorder Dataset -- Telegram (2020-2025)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18622</link><description>arXiv:2601.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, Brazil has experienced a decline in vaccination coverage, reversing decades of public health progress achieved through the National Immunization Program (PNI). Growing evidence points to the widespread circulation of vaccine-related misinformation -- particularly on social media platforms -- as a key factor driving this decline. Among these platforms, Telegram remains the only major platform permitting accessible and ethical data collection, offering insight into public channels where vaccine misinformation circulates extensively. This data paper introduces a curated dataset of about four million Telegram posts collected from 119 prominent Brazilian anti-vaccine channels between 2020 and 2025. The dataset includes message content, metadata, associated media, and classification related to vaccine posts, enabling researchers to examine how false or misleading information spreads, evolves, and influences public sentiment. By providing this resource, our aim is to support the scientific and public health community in developing evidence-based strategies to counter misinformation, promote trust in vaccination, and engage compassionately with individuals and communities affected by false narratives.

Abstract: Cross-modal image translation remains brittle and inefficient. Standard diffusion approaches often rely on a single, global linear transfer between domains. We find that this shortcut forces the sampler to traverse off-manifold, high-cost regions, inflating the correction burden and inviting semantic drift. We refer to this shared failure mode as fixed-schedule domain transfer. In this paper, we embed domain-shift dynamics directly into the generative process. Our model predicts a spatially varying mixing field at every reverse step and injects an explicit, target-consistent restoration term into the drift. This in-step guidance keeps large updates on-manifold and shifts the model's role from global alignment to local residual correction. We provide a continuous-time formulation with an exact solution form and derive a practical first-order sampler that preserves marginal consistency. Empirically, across translation tasks in medical imaging, remote sensing, and electroluminescence semantic mapping, our framework improves structural fidelity and semantic consistency while converging in fewer denoising steps.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18623v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CONQUER: Context-Aware Representation with Query Enhancement for Text-Based Person Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18625</link><description>arXiv:2601.18625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) aims to retrieve pedestrian images from large galleries using natural language descriptions. This task, essential for public safety applications, is hindered by cross-modal discrepancies and ambiguous user queries. We introduce CONQUER, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges by enhancing cross-modal alignment during training and adaptively refining queries at inference. During training, CONQUER employs multi-granularity encoding, complementary pair mining, and context-guided optimal matching based on Optimal Transport to learn robust embeddings. At inference, a plug-and-play query enhancement module refines vague or incomplete queries via anchor selection and attribute-driven enrichment, without requiring retraining of the backbone. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that CONQUER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both Rank-1 accuracy and mAP, yielding notable improvements in cross-domain and incomplete-query scenarios. These results highlight CONQUER as a practical and effective solution for real-world TBPS deployment.

Abstract: Natural gradients have long been studied in deep reinforcement learning due to their fast convergence properties and covariant weight updates. However, computing natural gradients requires inversion of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) at each iteration, which is computationally prohibitive in nature. In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable natural policy optimization technique that leverages a rank-1 approximation to full inverse-FIM. We theoretically show that under certain conditions, a rank-1 approximation to inverse-FIM converges faster than policy gradients and, under some conditions, enjoys the same sample complexity as stochastic policy gradient methods. We benchmark our method on a diverse set of environments and show that it achieves superior performance to standard actor-critic and trust-region baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18626v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ExoGS: A 4D Real-to-Sim-to-Real Framework for Scalable Manipulation Data Collection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18629</link><description>arXiv:2601.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-to-Sim-to-Real technique is gaining increasing interest for robotic manipulation, as it can generate scalable data in simulation while having narrower sim-to-real gap. However, previous methods mainly focused on environment-level visual real-to-sim transfer, ignoring the transfer of interactions, which could be challenging and inefficient to obtain purely in simulation especially for contact-rich tasks. We propose ExoGS, a robot-free 4D Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that captures both static environments and dynamic interactions in the real world and transfers them seamlessly to a simulated environment. It provides a new solution for scalable manipulation data collection and policy learning. ExoGS employs a self-designed robot-isomorphic passive exoskeleton AirExo-3 to capture kinematically consistent trajectories with millimeter-level accuracy and synchronized RGB observations during direct human demonstrations. The robot, objects, and environment are reconstructed as editable 3D Gaussian Splatting assets, enabling geometry-consistent replay and large-scale data augmentation. Additionally, a lightweight Mask Adapter injects instance-level semantics into the policy to enhance robustness under visual domain shifts. Real-world experiments demonstrate that ExoGS significantly improves data efficiency and policy generalization compared to teleoperation-based baselines.

Abstract: The escalating global mental health crisis, marked by persistent treatment gaps, availability, and a shortage of qualified therapists, positions Large Language Models (LLMs) as a promising avenue for scalable support. While LLMs offer potential for accessible emotional assistance, their reliability, therapeutic relevance, and alignment with human standards remain challenging to address. This paper introduces a human-grounded evaluation methodology designed to assess LLM generated responses in therapeutic dialogue. Our approach involved curating a dataset of 500 mental health conversations from datasets with real-world scenario questions and evaluating the responses generated by nine diverse LLMs, including closed source and open source models. More specifically, these responses were evaluated by two psychiatric trained experts, who independently rated each on a 5 point Likert scale across a comprehensive 6 attribute rubric. This rubric captures Cognitive Support and Affective Resonance, providing a multidimensional perspective on therapeutic quality. Our analysis reveals that LLMs provide strong cognitive reliability by producing safe, coherent, and clinically appropriate information, but they demonstrate unstable affective alignment. Although closed source models (e.g., GPT-4o) offer balanced therapeutic responses, open source models show greater variability and emotional flatness. We reveal a persistent cognitive-affective gap and highlight the need for failure aware, clinically grounded evaluation frameworks that prioritize relational sensitivity alongside informational accuracy in mental health oriented LLMs. We advocate for balanced evaluation protocols with human in the loop that center on therapeutic sensitivity and provide a framework to guide the responsible design and clinical oversight of mental health oriented conversational AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18630v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AdaReasoner: Dynamic Tool Orchestration for Iterative Visual Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18631</link><description>arXiv:2601.18631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When humans face problems beyond their immediate capabilities, they rely on tools, providing a promising paradigm for improving visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18631v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Splat-Portrait: Generalizing Talking Heads with Gaussian Splatting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18633</link><description>arXiv:2601.18633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Talking Head Generation aims at synthesizing natural-looking talking videos from speech and a single portrait image. Previous 3D talking head generation methods have relied on domain-specific heuristics such as warping-based facial motion representation priors to animate talking motions, yet still produce inaccurate 3D avatar reconstructions, thus undermining the realism of generated animations. We introduce Splat-Portrait, a Gaussian-splatting-based method that addresses the challenges of 3D head reconstruction and lip motion synthesis. Our approach automatically learns to disentangle a single portrait image into a static 3D reconstruction represented as static Gaussian Splatting, and a predicted whole-image 2D background. It then generates natural lip motion conditioned on input audio, without any motion driven priors. Training is driven purely by 2D reconstruction and score-distillation losses, without 3D supervision nor landmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Splat-Portrait exhibits superior performance on talking head generation and novel view synthesis, achieving better visual quality compared to previous works.

Abstract: Inverse design is a central goal in much of science and engineering, including frequency-selective surfaces (FSS) that are critical to microelectronics for telecommunications and optical metamaterials. Traditional surrogate-assisted optimization methods using deep learning can accelerate the design process but do not usually incorporate uncertainty quantification, leading to poorer optimization performance due to erroneous predictions in data-sparse regions. Here, we introduce and validate a fundamentally different paradigm of Physics-Informed Uncertainty, where the degree to which a model's prediction violates fundamental physical laws serves as a computationally-cheap and effective proxy for predictive uncertainty. By integrating physics-informed uncertainty into a multi-fidelity uncertainty-aware optimization workflow to design complex frequency-selective surfaces within the 20 - 30 GHz range, we increase the success rate of finding performant solutions from less than 10% to over 50%, while simultaneously reducing computational cost by an order of magnitude compared to the sole use of a high-fidelity solver. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating uncertainty quantification in machine-learning-driven inverse design for high-dimensional problems, and establish physics-informed uncertainty as a viable alternative to quantifying uncertainty in surrogate models for physical systems, thereby setting the stage for autonomous scientific discovery systems that can efficiently and robustly explore and evaluate candidate designs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18638v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constraint-Aware Discrete-Time PID Gain Optimization for Robotic Joint Control Under Actuator Saturation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18639</link><description>arXiv:2601.18639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise regulation of rotary actuation is fundamental in autonomous robotics, yet practical PID loops deviate from continuous-time theory due to discrete-time execution, actuator saturation, and small delays and measurement imperfections. We present an implementation-aware analysis and tuning workflow for saturated discrete-time joint control. We (i) derive PI stability regions under Euler and exact zero-order-hold (ZOH) discretizations using the Jury criterion, (ii) evaluate a discrete back-calculation anti-windup realization under saturation-dominant regimes, and (iii) propose a hybrid-certified Bayesian optimization workflow that screens analytically unstable candidates and behaviorally unsafe transients while optimizing a robust IAE objective with soft penalties on overshoot and saturation duty. Baseline sweeps ($\tau=1.0$~s, $\Delta t=0.01$~s, $u\in[-10,10]$) quantify rise/settle trends for P/PI/PID. Under a randomized model family emulating uncertainty, delay, noise, quantization, and tighter saturation, robustness-oriented tuning improves median IAE from $0.843$ to $0.430$ while keeping median overshoot below $2\%$. In simulation-only tuning, the certification screen rejects $11.6\%$ of randomly sampled gains within bounds before full robust evaluation, improving sample efficiency without hardware experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18639v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TwinPurify: Purifying gene expression data to reveal tumor-intrinsic transcriptional programs via self-supervised learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18640</link><description>arXiv:2601.18640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies have transformed tumor ecosystem profiling at cellular resolution. However, large scale studies on patient cohorts continue to rely on bulk transcriptomic data, where variation in tumor purity obscures tumor-intrinsic transcriptional signals and constrains downstream discovery. Many deconvolution methods report strong performance on synthetic bulk mixtures but fail to generalize to real patient cohorts because of unmodeled biological and technical variation.
  Here, we introduce TwinPurify, a representation learning framework that adapts the Barlow Twins self-supervised objective, representing a fundamental departure from the deconvolution paradigm. Rather than resolving the bulk mixture into discrete cell-type fractions, TwinPurify instead learns continuous, high-dimensional tumor embeddings by leveraging adjacent-normal profiles within the same cohort as "background" guidance, enabling the disentanglement of tumor-specific signals without relying on any external reference.
  Benchmarked against multiple large cancer cohorts across RNA-seq and microarray platforms, TwinPurify outperforms conventional representation learning baselines like auto-encoders in recovering tumor-intrinsic and immune signals. The purified embeddings improve molecular subtype and grade classification, enhance survival model concordance, and uncover biologically meaningful pathway activities compared to raw bulk profiles. By providing a transferable framework for decontaminating bulk transcriptomics, TwinPurify extends the utility of existing clinical datasets for molecular discovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18640v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FadeMem: Biologically-Inspired Forgetting for Efficient Agent Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18642</link><description>arXiv:2601.18642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models deployed as autonomous agents face critical memory limitations, lacking selective forgetting mechanisms that lead to either catastrophic forgetting at context boundaries or information overload within them. While human memory naturally balances retention and forgetting through adaptive decay processes, current AI systems employ binary retention strategies that preserve everything or lose it entirely. We propose FadeMem, a biologically-inspired agent memory architecture that incorporates active forgetting mechanisms mirroring human cognitive efficiency. FadeMem implements differential decay rates across a dual-layer memory hierarchy, where retention is governed by adaptive exponential decay functions modulated by semantic relevance, access frequency, and temporal patterns. Through LLM-guided conflict resolution and intelligent memory fusion, our system consolidates related information while allowing irrelevant details to fade. Experiments on Multi-Session Chat, LoCoMo, and LTI-Bench demonstrate superior multi-hop reasoning and retrieval with 45\% storage reduction, validating the effectiveness of biologically-inspired forgetting in agent memory systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18642v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FaLW: A Forgetting-aware Loss Reweighting for Long-tailed Unlearning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18650</link><description>arXiv:2601.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, which aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific data from trained models, is crucial for upholding data privacy regulations like the ``right to be forgotten". However, existing research predominantly evaluates unlearning methods on relatively balanced forget sets. This overlooks a common real-world scenario where data to be forgotten, such as a user's activity records, follows a long-tailed distribution. Our work is the first to investigate this critical research gap. We find that in such long-tailed settings, existing methods suffer from two key issues: \textit{Heterogeneous Unlearning Deviation} and \textit{Skewed Unlearning Deviation}. To address these challenges, we propose FaLW, a plug-and-play, instance-wise dynamic loss reweighting method. FaLW innovatively assesses the unlearning state of each sample by comparing its predictive probability to the distribution of unseen data from the same class. Based on this, it uses a forgetting-aware reweighting scheme, modulated by a balancing factor, to adaptively adjust the unlearning intensity for each sample. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaLW achieves superior performance.

We propose algorithms for learning IAMs and their mixtures from data, using either maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian learning. We then apply these algorithms to a large set of elections from the Pabulib database. In particular, we find that single-component models are rarely sufficient to capture the complexity of real-life data, whereas their mixtures perform well.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18651v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Is Self-Disclosure Optimal? Incentives and Governance of AI-Generated Content</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18654</link><description>arXiv:2601.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) is reshaping content creation on digital platforms by reducing production costs and enabling scalable output of varying quality. In response, platforms have begun adopting disclosure policies that require creators to label AI-generated content, often supported by imperfect detection and penalties for non-compliance. This paper develops a formal model to study the economic implications of such disclosure regimes. We compare a non-disclosure benchmark, in which the platform alone detects AI usage, with a mandatory self-disclosure regime in which creators strategically choose whether to disclose or conceal AI use under imperfect enforcement. The model incorporates heterogeneous creators, viewer discounting of AI-labeled content, trust penalties following detected non-disclosure, and endogenous enforcement. The analysis shows that disclosure is optimal only when both the value of AI-generated content and its cost-saving advantage are intermediate. As AI capability improves, the platform's optimal enforcement strategy evolves from strict deterrence to partial screening and eventual deregulation. While disclosure reliably increases transparency, it reduces aggregate creator surplus and can suppress high-quality AI content when AI is technologically advanced. Overall, the results characterize disclosure as a strategic governance instrument whose effectiveness depends on technological maturity and trust frictions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18654v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Rotation Diversity in Displaced Squeezed Binary Phase-Shift Keying</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18655</link><description>arXiv:2601.18655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum rotation diversity (QRD) scheme for optical quantum communication using binary phase-shift-keying displaced squeezed states and homodyne detection over Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels. Consecutive temporal modes are coupled by a passive orthogonal rotation that redistributes the displacement amplitude between slots, yielding a diversity order of two under independent fading and joint maximum-likelihood detection. Analytical expressions for the symbol-error rate performance, along with asymptotic results for the diversity and coding gains, are derived. The optimal rotation angle and energy allocation between displacement and squeezing are obtained in closed form. Furthermore, we show that when both the displacement amplitude and the squeezing strength scale with the total photon number, an effective diversity order of four is achieved. Numerical results validate the analysis and demonstrate the super-diversity behaviour of the proposed QRD scheme.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18655v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] S$^2$GR: Stepwise Semantic-Guided Reasoning in Latent Space for Generative Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18664</link><description>arXiv:2601.18664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a transformative paradigm with its end-to-end generation advantages. However, existing GR methods primarily focus on direct Semantic ID (SID) generation from interaction sequences, failing to activate deeper reasoning capabilities analogous to those in large language models and thus limiting performance potential. We identify two critical limitations in current reasoning-enhanced GR approaches: (1) Strict sequential separation between reasoning and generation steps creates imbalanced computational focus across hierarchical SID codes, degrading quality for SID codes; (2) Generated reasoning vectors lack interpretable semantics, while reasoning paths suffer from unverifiable supervision. In this paper, we propose stepwise semantic-guided reasoning in latent space (S$^2$GR), a novel reasoning enhanced GR framework. First, we establish a robust semantic foundation via codebook optimization, integrating item co-occurrence relationship to capture behavioral patterns, and load balancing and uniformity objectives that maximize codebook utilization while reinforcing coarse-to-fine semantic hierarchies. Our core innovation introduces the stepwise reasoning mechanism inserting thinking tokens before each SID generation step, where each token explicitly represents coarse-grained semantics supervised via contrastive learning against ground-truth codebook cluster distributions ensuring physically grounded reasoning paths and balanced computational focus across all SID codes.

Client-driven adaptation reacts slowly to shared congestion, while server-based coordination introduces scalability bottlenecks and single points of failure. We present COMETS, a coordinated multi-destination video transmission framework that leverages information-centric networking principles such as request aggregation and in-network state awareness to enable scalable, fair, and adaptive rate control. COMETS introduces a novel range-interest protocol and distributed in-network decision process that aligns video quality across receiver groups while minimizing redundant transmissions. To achieve this, we develop a lightweight distributed optimization framework that guides per-hop quality adaptation without centralized control. Extensive emulation shows that COMETS consistently improves bandwidth utilization, fairness, and user-perceived quality of experience over DASH, MoQ, and ICN baselines, particularly under high concurrency. The results highlight COMETS as a practical, deployable approach for next-generation scalable video delivery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18670v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Dynamic Framework for Grid Adaptation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18672</link><description>arXiv:2601.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently demonstrated promising potential in scientific machine learning, partly due to their capacity for grid adaptation during training. However, existing adaptation strategies rely solely on input data density, failing to account for the geometric complexity of the target function or metrics calculated during network training. In this work, we propose a generalized framework that treats knot allocation as a density estimation task governed by Importance Density Functions (IDFs), allowing training dynamics to determine grid resolution. We introduce a curvature-based adaptation strategy and evaluate it across synthetic function fitting, regression on a subset of the Feynman dataset and different instances of the Helmholtz PDE, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the standard input-based baseline. Specifically, our method yields average relative error reductions of 25.3% on synthetic functions, 9.4% on the Feynman dataset, and 23.3% on the PDE benchmark. Statistical significance is confirmed via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, establishing curvature-based adaptation as a robust and computationally efficient alternative for KAN training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18672v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning temporal embeddings from electronic health records of chronic kidney disease patients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18675</link><description>arXiv:2601.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether temporal embedding models trained on longitudinal electronic health records can learn clinically meaningful representations without compromising predictive performance, and how architectural choices affect embedding quality. Model-guided medicine requires representations that capture disease dynamics while remaining transparent and task agnostic, whereas most clinical prediction models are optimised for a single task. Representation learning facilitates learning embeddings that generalise across downstream tasks, and recurrent architectures are well-suited for modelling temporal structure in observational clinical data. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we study patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and compare three recurrent architectures: a vanilla LSTM, an attention-augmented LSTM, and a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM). All models are trained both as embedding models and as direct end-to-end predictors. Embedding quality is evaluated via CKD stage clustering and in-ICU mortality prediction. The T-LSTM produces more structured embeddings, achieving a lower Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI = 9.91) and higher CKD stage classification accuracy (0.74) than the vanilla LSTM (DBI = 15.85, accuracy = 0.63) and attention-augmented LSTM (DBI = 20.72, accuracy = 0.67). For in-ICU mortality prediction, embedding models consistently outperform end-to-end predictors, improving accuracy from 0.72-0.75 to 0.82-0.83, which indicates that learning embeddings as an intermediate step is more effective than direct end-to-end learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18675v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quasi Monte Carlo methods enable extremely low-dimensional deep generative models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18676</link><description>arXiv:2601.18676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces quasi-Monte Carlo latent variable models (QLVMs): a class of deep generative models that are specialized for finding extremely low-dimensional and interpretable embeddings of high-dimensional datasets. Unlike standard approaches, which rely on a learned encoder and variational lower bounds, QLVMs directly approximate the marginal likelihood by randomized quasi-Monte Carlo integration. While this brute force approach has drawbacks in higher-dimensional spaces, we find that it excels in fitting one, two, and three dimensional deep latent variable models. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that QLVMs consistently outperform conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs) and importance weighted autoencoders (IWAEs) with matched latent dimensionality. The resulting embeddings enable transparent visualization and post hoc analyses such as nonparametric density estimation, clustering, and geodesic path computation, which are nontrivial to validate in higher-dimensional spaces. While our approach is compute-intensive and struggles to generate fine-scale details in complex datasets, it offers a compelling solution for applications prioritizing interpretability and latent space analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18676v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ART for Diffusion Sampling: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Timestep Schedule</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18681</link><description>arXiv:2601.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time discretization for score-based diffusion models to generate samples from a learned reverse-time dynamic on a finite grid. Uniform and hand-crafted grids can be suboptimal given a budget on the number of time steps. We introduce Adaptive Reparameterized Time (ART) that controls the clock speed of a reparameterized time variable, leading to a time change and uneven timesteps along the sampling trajectory while preserving the terminal time. The objective is to minimize the aggregate error arising from the discretized Euler scheme. We derive a randomized control companion, ART-RL, and formulate time change as a continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) problem with Gaussian policies. We then prove that solving ART-RL recovers the optimal ART schedule, which in turn enables practical actor--critic updates to learn the latter in a data-driven way. Empirically, based on the official EDM pipeline, ART-RL improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance on CIFAR-10 over a wide range of budgets and transfers to AFHQv2, FFHQ, and ImageNet without the need of retraining.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18681v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Pragmatic VLA Foundation Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18692</link><description>arXiv:2601.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offering great potential in robotic manipulation, a capable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model is expected to faithfully generalize across tasks and platforms while ensuring cost efficiency (e.g., data and GPU hours required for adaptation). To this end, we develop LingBot-VLA with around 20,000 hours of real-world data from 9 popular dual-arm robot configurations. Through a systematic assessment on 3 robotic platforms, each completing 100 tasks with 130 post-training episodes per task, our model achieves clear superiority over competitors, showcasing its strong performance and broad generalizability. We have also built an efficient codebase, which delivers a throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU with an 8-GPU training setup, representing a 1.5~2.8$\times$ (depending on the relied VLM base model) speedup over existing VLA-oriented codebases. The above features ensure that our model is well-suited for real-world deployment. To advance the field of robot learning, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with a focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18692v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Multi-Speaker Voice Cloning for Nepali in Low-Resource Settings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18694</link><description>arXiv:2601.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a few-shot voice cloning system for Nepali speakers, designed to synthesize speech in a specific speaker's voice from Devanagari text using minimal data. Voice cloning in Nepali remains largely unexplored due to its low-resource nature. To address this, we constructed separate datasets: untranscribed audio for training a speaker encoder and paired text-audio data for training a Tacotron2-based synthesizer. The speaker encoder, optimized with Generative End2End loss, generates embeddings that capture the speaker's vocal identity, validated through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimension reduction visualizations. These embeddings are fused with Tacotron2's text embeddings to produce mel-spectrograms, which are then converted into audio using a WaveRNN vocoder. Audio data were collected from various sources, including self-recordings, and underwent thorough preprocessing for quality and alignment. Training was performed using mel and gate loss functions under multiple hyperparameter settings. The system effectively clones speaker characteristics even for unseen voices, demonstrating the feasibility of few-shot voice cloning for the Nepali language and establishing a foundation for personalized speech synthesis in low-resource scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18694v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explainability Methods for Hardware Trojan Detection: A Systematic Comparison</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18696</link><description>arXiv:2601.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware trojan detection requires accurate identification and interpretable explanations for security engineers to validate and act on results. This work compares three explainability categories for gate-level trojan detection on the Trust-Hub benchmark: (1) domain-aware property-based analysis of 31 circuit-specific features from gate fanin patterns, flip-flop distances, and I/O connectivity; (2) case-based reasoning using k-nearest neighbors for precedent-based explanations; and (3) model-agnostic feature attribution (LIME, SHAP, gradient).
  Results show different advantages per approach. Property-based analysis provides explanations through circuit concepts like "high fanin complexity near outputs indicates potential triggers." Case-based reasoning achieves 97.4% correspondence between predictions and training exemplars, offering justifications grounded in precedent. LIME and SHAP provide feature attributions with strong inter-method correlation (r=0.94, p&lt;0.001) but lack circuit-level context for validation.
  XGBoost classification achieves 46.15% precision and 52.17% recall on 11,392 test samples, a 9-fold precision improvement over prior work (Hasegawa et al.: 5.13%) while reducing false positive rates from 5.6% to 0.25%. Gradient-based attribution runs 481 times faster than SHAP but provides similar domain-opaque insights.
  This work demonstrates that property-based and case-based approaches offer domain alignment and precedent-based interpretability compared to generic feature rankings, with implications for XAI deployment where practitioners must validate ML predictions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18696v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Instead of Replacing Online Coding Communities with AI through Community-Enriched Chatbot Designs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18697</link><description>arXiv:2601.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based chatbots like ChatGPT have become popular tools for assisting with coding tasks. However, they often produce isolated responses and lack mechanisms for social learning or contextual grounding. In contrast, online coding communities like Kaggle offer socially mediated learning environments that foster critical thinking, engagement, and a sense of belonging. Yet, growing reliance on LLMs risks diminishing participation in these communities and weakening their collaborative value. To address this, we propose Community-Enriched AI, a design paradigm that embeds social learning dynamics into LLM-based chatbots by surfacing user-generated content and social design feature from online coding communities. Using this paradigm, we implemented a RAG-based AI chatbot leveraging resources from Kaggle to validate our design. Across two empirical studies involving 28 and 12 data science learners, respectively, we found that Community-Enriched AI significantly enhances user trust, encourages engagement with community, and effectively supports learners in solving data science tasks. We conclude by discussing design implications for AI assistance systems that bridge -- rather than replace -- online coding communities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18697v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are Video Generation Models Geographically Fair?

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced visually compelling results, yet it remains unclear whether these models encode geographically equitable visual knowledge. In this work, we investigate the geo-equity and geographically grounded visual knowledge of text-to-video models through an attraction-centric evaluation. We introduce Geo-Attraction Landmark Probing (GAP), a systematic framework for assessing how faithfully models synthesize tourist attractions from diverse regions, and construct GEOATTRACTION-500, a benchmark of 500 globally distributed attractions spanning varied regions and popularity levels. GAP integrates complementary metrics that disentangle overall video quality from attraction-specific knowledge, including global structural alignment, fine-grained keypoint-based alignment, and vision-language model judgments, all validated against human evaluation. Applying GAP to the state-of-the-art text-to-video model Sora 2, we find that, contrary to common assumptions of strong geographic bias, the model exhibits a relatively uniform level of geographically grounded visual knowledge across regions, development levels, and cultural groupings, with only weak dependence on attraction popularity. These results suggest that current text-to-video models express global visual knowledge more evenly than expected, highlighting both their promise for globally deployed applications and the need for continued evaluation as such systems evolve.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18698v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mechanistic Analysis of Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models During Continual Fine-tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18699</link><description>arXiv:2601.18699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit remarkable performance across diverse tasks through pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms. However, continual fine-tuning on sequential tasks induces catastrophic forgetting, where newly acquired knowledge interferes with previously learned capabilities. Despite widespread observations of this phenomenon, the mechanistic understanding remains limited. Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of catastrophic forgetting in transformer-based LLMs during sequential fine-tuning. Through systematic experiments across multiple model scales (109B to 400B total parameters) and task sequences, we identify three primary mechanisms driving forgetting: gradient interference in attention weights, representational drift in intermediate layers, and loss landscape flattening. We demonstrate that forgetting severity correlates strongly with task similarity (Pearson r = 0.87) and gradient alignment metrics. Our analysis reveals that approximately 15 to 23 percent of attention heads undergo severe disruption during fine-tuning, with lower layers showing greater susceptibility. These findings establish mechanistic foundations for developing targeted mitigation strategies in continual learning systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18699v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TEA-Bench: A Systematic Benchmarking of Tool-enhanced Emotional Support Dialogue Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18700</link><description>arXiv:2601.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation requires not only affective expression but also grounded instrumental support to provide trustworthy guidance. However, existing ESC systems and benchmarks largely focus on affective support in text-only settings, overlooking how external tools can enable factual grounding and reduce hallucination in multi-turn emotional support. We introduce TEA-Bench, the first interactive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented agents in ESC, featuring realistic emotional scenarios, an MCP-style tool environment, and process-level metrics that jointly assess the quality and factual grounding of emotional support. Experiments on nine LLMs show that tool augmentation generally improves emotional support quality and reduces hallucination, but the gains are strongly capacity-dependent: stronger models use tools more selectively and effectively, while weaker models benefit only marginally. We further release TEA-Dialog, a dataset of tool-enhanced ESC dialogues, and find that supervised fine-tuning improves in-distribution support but generalizes poorly. Our results underscore the importance of tool use in building reliable emotional support agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18700v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Fuzzy to Exact: The Halo Architecture for Infinite-Depth Reasoning via Rational Arithmetic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18702</link><description>arXiv:2601.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current paradigms in Deep Learning prioritize computational throughput over numerical precision, relying on the assumption that intelligence emerges from statistical correlation at scale. In this paper, we challenge this orthodoxy. We propose the Exactness Hypothesis: that General Intelligence (AGI), specifically high-order causal inference, requires a computational substrate capable of Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic. We argue that the "hallucinations" and logical incoherence seen in current Large Language Models (LLMs) are artifacts of IEEE 754 floating-point approximation errors accumulating over deep compositional functions. To mitigate this, we introduce the Halo Architecture, a paradigm shift to Rational Arithmetic ($\mathbb{Q}$) supported by a novel Exact Inference Unit (EIU). Empirical validation on the Huginn-0125 prototype demonstrates that while 600B-parameter scale BF16 baselines collapse in chaotic systems, Halo maintains zero numerical divergence indefinitely. This work establishes exact arithmetic as a prerequisite for reducing logical uncertainty in System 2 AGI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18702v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient SN-like and PN-like Dynamic Low Rank methods for Thermal Radiative Transfer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18705</link><description>arXiv:2601.18705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Low Rank (DLR) methods are a promising way to reduce the computational cost and memory footprint of the high-dimensional thermal radiative transfer (TRT) equations. The TRT equations are a system of nonlinear PDEs that model the energy exhchange between the material temperature and the radiation energy density; due to their high dimensionality, solving the TRT equations is often bottleneck in multi-physics simulations. DLR methods represent the solution in terms of time-evolving SVD-like factors of angle and space. Although previous work has explored DLR methods for TRT, most of the methods have limitations that make them impractical for realistic scenarios and uncompetitive with current non-DLR production codes.
  Here we develop new PN-like and SN-like Dynamic Low Rank (DLR) methods for TRT. In the SN-like DLR method, we use the time-evolving angular basis functions to select time-evolving angles; this DLR formulation enables us to use the highly optimized SN transport sweep as our main computational kernel, and results in a practical way of leveraging low-rank methods in production TRT codes. In contrast, our PN-like DLR method uses an even-parity formulation and results in positive-definite linear systems to solve for each time step.
  We demonstrate the methods on several challenging, highly heterogenous problems in two spatial dimensions $(4$D) that these DLR schemes can give significant reduction in angular artifacts (``ray effects'') with the same cost as gold-standard SN methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18705v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Health-SCORE: Towards Scalable Rubrics for Improving Health-LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18706</link><description>arXiv:2601.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rubrics are essential for evaluating open-ended LLM responses, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare. However, creating high-quality and domain-specific rubrics typically requires significant human expertise time and development cost, making rubric-based evaluation and training difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce Health-SCORE, a generalizable and scalable rubric-based training and evaluation framework that substantially reduces rubric development costs without sacrificing performance. We show that Health-SCORE provides two practical benefits beyond standalone evaluation: it can be used as a structured reward signal to guide reinforcement learning with safety-aware supervision, and it can be incorporated directly into prompts to improve response quality through in-context learning. Across open-ended healthcare tasks, Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality comparable to human-created rubrics while significantly lowering development effort, making rubric-based evaluation and training more scalable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18706v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SMART: Scalable Mesh-free Aerodynamic Simulations from Raw Geometries using a Transformer-based Surrogate Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18707</link><description>arXiv:2601.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning-based surrogate models have emerged as more efficient alternatives to numerical solvers for physical simulations over complex geometries, such as car bodies. Many existing models incorporate the simulation mesh as an additional input, thereby reducing prediction errors. However, generating a simulation mesh for new geometries is computationally costly. In contrast, mesh-free methods, which do not rely on the simulation mesh, typically incur higher errors. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce SMART, a neural surrogate model that predicts physical quantities at arbitrary query locations using only a point-cloud representation of the geometry, without requiring access to the simulation mesh. The geometry and simulation parameters are encoded into a shared latent space that captures both structural and parametric characteristics of the physical field. A physics decoder then attends to the encoder's intermediate latent representations to map spatial queries to physical quantities. Through this cross-layer interaction, the model jointly updates latent geometric features and the evolving physical field. Extensive experiments show that SMART is competitive with and often outperforms existing methods that rely on the simulation mesh as input, demonstrating its capabilities for industry-level simulations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18707v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analyzing Images of Blood Cells with Quantum Machine Learning Methods: Equilibrium Propagation and Variational Quantum Circuits to Detect Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18710</link><description>arXiv:2601.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a feasibility study demonstrating that quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms achieve competitive performance on real-world medical imaging despite operating under severe constraints. We evaluate Equilibrium Propagation (EP), an energy-based learning method that does not use backpropagation (incompatible with quantum systems due to state-collapsing measurements) and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for automated detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) from blood cell microscopy images using binary classification (2 classes: AML vs. Healthy).
  Key Result: Using limited subsets (50-250 samples per class) of the AML-Cytomorphology dataset (18,365 expert-annotated images), quantum methods achieve performance only 12-15% below classical CNNs despite reduced image resolution (64x64 pixels), engineered features (20D), and classical simulation via Qiskit. EP reaches 86.4% accuracy (only 12% below CNN) without backpropagation, while the 4-qubit VQC attains 83.0% accuracy with consistent data efficiency: VQC maintains stable 83% performance with only 50 samples per class, whereas CNN requires 250 samples (5x more data) to reach 98%. These results establish reproducible baselines for QML in healthcare, validating NISQ-era feasibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18710v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conditioned Generative Modeling of Molecular Glues: A Realistic AI Approach for Synthesizable Drug-like Molecules</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18716</link><description>arXiv:2601.18716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by the pathological accumulation of amyloid beta-42 (Abeta-42), contributing to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. While extracellular amyloid plaques are well-studied, increasing evidence highlights intracellular Abeta-42 as an early and toxic driver of disease progression. In this study, we present a novel, AI-assisted drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Abeta-42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Abeta-42 with three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and MDM2, through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking. We then developed a Ligase-Conditioned Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (LC-JT-VAE) to generate ligase-specific small molecules, incorporating protein sequence embeddings and torsional angle-aware molecular graphs. Our results demonstrate that this generative model can produce chemically valid, novel, and target-specific molecular glues capable of facilitating Abeta-42 degradation. This integrated approach offers a promising framework for designing UPS-targeted therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18716v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gained in Translation: Privileged Pairwise Judges Enhance Multilingual Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18722</link><description>arXiv:2601.18722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When asked a question in a language less seen in its training data, current reasoning large language models (RLMs) often exhibit dramatically lower performance than when asked the same question in English. In response, we introduce \texttt{SP3F} (Self-Play with Privileged Pairwise Feedback), a two-stage framework for enhancing multilingual reasoning without \textit{any} data in the target language(s). First, we supervise fine-tune (SFT) on translated versions of English question-answer pairs to raise base model correctness. Second, we perform RL with feedback from a pairwise judge in a self-play fashion, with the judge receiving the English reference response as \textit{privileged information}. Thus, even when none of the model's responses are completely correct, the privileged pairwise judge can still tell which response is better. End-to-end, \texttt{SP3F} greatly improves base model performance, even outperforming fully post-trained models on multiple math and non-math tasks with less than

Abstract: Driven by the rapid evolution of Vision-Action and Vision-Language-Action models, imitation learning has significantly advanced robotic manipulation capabilities. However, evaluation methodologies have lagged behind, hindering the establishment of Trustworthy Evaluation for these behaviors. Current paradigms rely on binary success rates, failing to address the critical dimensions of trust: Source Authenticity (i.e., distinguishing genuine policy behaviors from human teleoperation) and Execution Quality (e.g., smoothness and safety). To bridge these gaps, we propose a solution that combines the Eval-Actions benchmark and the AutoEval architecture. First, we construct the Eval-Actions benchmark to support trustworthiness analysis. Distinct from existing datasets restricted to successful human demonstrations, Eval-Actions integrates VA and VLA policy execution trajectories alongside human teleoperation data, explicitly including failure scenarios. This dataset is structured around three core supervision signals: Expert Grading (EG), Rank-Guided preferences (RG), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Building on this, we propose the AutoEval architecture: AutoEval leverages Spatio-Temporal Aggregation for semantic assessment, augmented by an auxiliary Kinematic Calibration Signal to refine motion smoothness; AutoEval Plus (AutoEval-P) incorporates the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) paradigm to enhance logical reasoning capabilities. Experiments show AutoEval achieves Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficients (SRCC) of 0.81 and 0.84 under the EG and RG protocols, respectively. Crucially, the framework possesses robust source discrimination capabilities, distinguishing between policy-generated and teleoperated videos with 99.6% accuracy, thereby establishing a rigorous standard for trustworthy robotic evaluation.

Abstract: Recently, we have often observed hallucinated citations or references that do not correspond to any existing work in papers under review, preprints, or published papers. Such hallucinated citations pose a serious concern to scientific reliability. When they appear in accepted papers, they may also negatively affect the credibility of conferences. In this study, we refer to hallucinated citations as "HalluCitation" and systematically investigate their prevalence and impact. We analyze all papers published at ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP in 2024 and 2025, including main conference, Findings, and workshop papers. Our analysis reveals that nearly 300 papers contain at least one HalluCitation, most of which were published in 2025. Notably, half of these papers were identified at EMNLP 2025, the most recent conference, indicating that this issue is rapidly increasing. Moreover, more than 100 such papers were accepted as main conference and Findings papers at EMNLP 2025, affecting the credibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18724v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An ISAC-ready Full-Duplex Backscatter Architecture for the mmWave IoT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18727</link><description>arXiv:2601.18727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving long-range, high-rate, concurrent two-way mmWave communication with power-constrained IoT devices is fundamental to scaling future ubiquitous sensing systems, yet the substantial power demands and high cost of mmWave hardware have long stood in the way of practical deployment. This paper presents the first mmWave full-duplex backscatter tag architecture, charting a genuinely low-cost path toward high-performance mmWave connectivity and localization for ISAC systems. The proposed tag operates at ranges beyond 45m on the uplink and beyond 200m on the downlink, delivering 20x the reach of state-of-the-art systems while being over 100x cheaper than existing mmWave backscatter platforms. Enabling this leap is a novel low-power regenerative amplifier that provides 30 dB of gain while consuming only 30 mW, paired with a regenerative rectifier that achieves state-of-the-art sensitivity down to -60 dBm. We integrate our circuits on a compact PCB and evaluate it across diverse uplink and downlink scenarios, where it achieves an downlink BER of $10^{-1}$ at 200 meters and a uplink BER of $10^{-2}$ at 45 meters, demonstrating resilient, high-quality communication even at extended ranges.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18727v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Riemannian AmbientFlow: Towards Simultaneous Manifold Learning and Generative Modeling from Corrupted Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18728</link><description>arXiv:2601.18728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern generative modeling methods have demonstrated strong performance in learning complex data distributions from clean samples. In many scientific and imaging applications, however, clean samples are unavailable, and only noisy or linearly corrupted measurements can be observed. Moreover, latent structures, such as manifold geometries, present in the data are important to extract for further downstream scientific analysis. In this work, we introduce Riemannian AmbientFlow, a framework for simultaneously learning a probabilistic generative model and the underlying, nonlinear data manifold directly from corrupted observations. Building on the variational inference framework of AmbientFlow, our approach incorporates data-driven Riemannian geometry induced by normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of manifold structure through pullback metrics and Riemannian Autoencoders. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that, under appropriate geometric regularization and measurement conditions, the learned model recovers the underlying data distribution up to a controllable error and yields a smooth, bi-Lipschitz manifold parametrization. We further show that the resulting smooth decoder can serve as a principled generative prior for inverse problems with recovery guarantees. We empirically validate our approach on low-dimensional synthetic manifolds and on MNIST.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18728v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reflect: Transparent Principle-Guided Reasoning for Constitutional Alignment at Scale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18730</link><description>arXiv:2601.18730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constitutional framework of alignment aims to align large language models (LLMs) with value-laden principles written in natural language (such as to avoid using biased language). Prior work has focused on parameter fine-tuning techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to instill these principles. However, these approaches are computationally demanding, require careful engineering and tuning, and often require difficult-to-obtain human annotation data. We propose \textsc{reflect}, an inference-time framework for constitutional alignment that does not require any training or data, providing a plug-and-play approach for aligning an instruction-tuned model to a set of principles. \textsc{reflect} operates entirely in-context, combining a (i) constitution-conditioned base response with post-generation (ii) self-evaluation, (iii)(a) self-critique, and (iii)(b) final revision. \textsc{reflect}'s technique of explicit in-context reasoning over principles during post-generation outperforms standard few-shot prompting and provides transparent reasoning traces. Our results demonstrate that \textsc{reflect} significantly improves LLM conformance to diverse and complex principles, including principles quite distinct from those emphasized in the model's original parameter fine-tuning, without sacrificing factual reasoning. \textsc{reflect} is particularly effective at reducing the rate of rare but significant violations of principles, thereby improving safety and robustness in the tail end of the distribution of generations. Finally, we show that \textsc{reflect} naturally generates useful training data for traditional parameter fine-tuning techniques, allowing for efficient scaling and the reduction of inference-time computational overhead in long-term deployment scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18730v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One Adapts to Any: Meta Reward Modeling for Personalized LLM Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18731</link><description>arXiv:2601.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to align outputs with human preferences, and personalized alignment further adapts models to individual users. This relies on personalized reward models that capture user-specific preferences and automatically provide individualized feedback. However, developing these models faces two critical challenges: the scarcity of feedback from individual users and the need for efficient adaptation to unseen users. We argue that addressing these constraints requires a paradigm shift from fitting data to learn user preferences to learn the process of preference adaptation. To realize this, we propose Meta Reward Modeling (MRM), which reformulates personalized reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Specifically, we represent each user's reward model as a weighted combination of base reward functions, and optimize the initialization of these weights using a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)-style framework to support fast adaptation under limited feedback. To ensure robustness, we introduce the Robust Personalization Objective (RPO), which places greater emphasis on hard-to-learn users during meta optimization. Extensive experiments on personalized preference datasets validate that MRM enhances few-shot personalization, improves user robustness, and consistently outperforms baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18731v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Advances and Innovations in the Multi-Agent Robotic System (MARS) Challenge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18733</link><description>arXiv:2601.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models and vision-languageaction models have significantly driven progress in Embodied AI. As the field transitions toward more complex task scenarios, multi-agent system frameworks are becoming essential for achieving scalable, efficient, and collaborative solutions. This shift is fueled by three primary factors: increasing agent capabilities, enhancing system efficiency through task delegation, and enabling advanced human-agent interactions. To address the challenges posed by multi-agent collaboration, we propose the Multi-Agent Robotic System (MARS) Challenge, held at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on SpaVLE. The competition focuses on two critical areas: planning and control, where participants explore multi-agent embodied planning using vision-language models (VLMs) to coordinate tasks and policy execution to perform robotic manipulation in dynamic environments. By evaluating solutions submitted by participants, the challenge provides valuable insights into the design and coordination of embodied multi-agent systems, contributing to the future development of advanced collaborative AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18733v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Distilled Reasoner: On-Policy Self-Distillation for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18734</link><description>arXiv:2601.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation improves large language model (LLM) reasoning by compressing the knowledge of a teacher LLM to train smaller LLMs. On-policy distillation advances this approach by having the student sample its own trajectories while a teacher LLM provides dense token-level supervision, addressing the distribution mismatch between training and inference in off-policy distillation methods. However, on-policy distillation typically requires a separate, often larger, teacher LLM and does not explicitly leverage ground-truth solutions available in reasoning datasets. Inspired by the intuition that a sufficiently capable LLM can rationalize external privileged reasoning traces and teach its weaker self (i.e., the version without access to privileged information), we introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), a framework where a single model acts as both teacher and student by conditioning on different contexts. The teacher policy conditions on privileged information (e.g., verified reasoning traces) while the student policy sees only the question; training minimizes the per-token divergence between these distributions over the student's own rollouts. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving 4-8x token efficiency compared to reinforcement learning methods such as GRPO and superior performance over off-policy distillation methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18734v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why Keep Your Doubts to Yourself? Trading Visual Uncertainties in Multi-Agent Bandit Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18735</link><description>arXiv:2601.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multi-agent systems, but scaling them is economically unsustainable: coordinating heterogeneous agents under information asymmetry often spirals costs. Existing paradigms, such as Mixture-of-Agents and knowledge-based routers, rely on heuristic proxies that ignore costs and collapse uncertainty structure, leading to provably suboptimal coordination. We introduce Agora, a framework that reframes coordination as a decentralized market for uncertainty. Agora formalizes epistemic uncertainty into a structured, tradable asset (perceptual, semantic, inferential), and enforces profitability-driven trading among agents based on rational economic rules. A market-aware broker, extending Thompson Sampling, initiates collaboration and guides the system toward cost-efficient equilibria. Experiments on five multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, MMBench, MathVision, InfoVQA, CC-OCR) show that Agora outperforms strong VLMs and heuristic multi-agent strategies, e.g., achieving +8.5% accuracy over the best baseline on MMMU while reducing cost by over 3x. These results establish market-based coordination as a principled and scalable paradigm for building economically viable multi-agent visual intelligence systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for IoT Malware Detection under Data Scarcity and Drift</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18736</link><description>arXiv:2601.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in domains such as smart cities, transportation, and industrial systems has heightened the urgency of addressing their security vulnerabilities. IoT devices often operate under limited computational resources, lack robust physical safeguards, and are deployed in heterogeneous and dynamic networks, making them prime targets for cyberattacks and malware applications. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to automated malware detection and classification, but practical deployment requires models that are both effective and lightweight. The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of four supervised learning models (Random Forest, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron) for malware detection and classification using the IoT-23 dataset. We evaluate model performance in both binary and multiclass classification tasks, assess sensitivity to training data volume, and analyze temporal robustness to simulate deployment in evolving threat landscapes. Our results show that tree-based models achieve high accuracy and generalization, even with limited training data, while performance deteriorates over time as malware diversity increases. These findings underscore the importance of adaptive, resource-efficient ML models for securing IoT systems in real-world environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18736v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Scanning-Based Indoor Optical Wireless Positioning System with Single VCSEL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18740</link><description>arXiv:2601.18740v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Time series data is ubiquitous in real-world scenarios and crucial for critical applications ranging from energy management to traffic control. Consequently, the ability to reason over time series is a fundamental skill for generalist models to solve practical problems. However, this dimension is notably absent from existing benchmarks of generalist models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TSRBench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning capabilities. TSRBench features: i) a diverse set of 4125 problems from 14 domains, and is categorized into 4 major dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, Prediction, and Decision-Making. ii) 15 tasks from the 4 dimensions evaluating essential reasoning capabilities (e.g., numerical reasoning). Through extensive experiments, we evaluated over 30 leading proprietary and open-source LLMs, VLMs, and TSLLMs within TSRBench. Our findings reveal that: i) scaling laws hold for perception and reasoning but break down for prediction; ii) strong reasoning does not guarantee accurate context-aware forecasting, indicating a decoupling between semantic understanding and numerical prediction; and iii) despite the complementary nature of textual and visual represenations of time series as inputs, current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them for reciprocal performance gains. TSRBench provides a standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance generalist models. Our code and dataset are available at https://tsrbench.github.io/.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18744v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Capturing P: On the Expressive Power and Efficient Evaluation of Boolean Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18747</link><description>arXiv:2601.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern information retrieval is transitioning from simple document filtering to complex, neuro-symbolic reasoning workflows. However, current retrieval architectures face a fundamental efficiency dilemma when handling the rigorous logical and arithmetic constraints required by this new paradigm. Standard iterator-based engines (Document-at-a-Time) do not natively support complex, nested logic graphs; forcing them to execute such queries typically results in intractable runtime performance. Conversely, naive recursive approaches (Term-at-a-Time), while capable of supporting these structures, suffer from prohibitive memory consumption when enforcing broad logical exclusions.
  In this paper, we propose that a retrieval engine must be capable of ``Capturing $\mathbf{P}$'' -- evaluating any polynomial-time property directly over its index in a computationally efficient manner. We define a formal Retrieval Language ($\mathcal{L}_R$) based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and prove it precisely captures the complexity class $\mathbf{P}$. We introduce \texttt{ComputePN}, a novel evaluation algorithm that makes $\mathcal{L}_R$ tractable. By combining native DAG traversal with a memory-efficient ``Positive-Negative'' response mechanism, \texttt{ComputePN} ensures the efficient evaluation of any query in $\mathcal{L}_R$. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for turning the search index into a general-purpose computational engine.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sampling Sphere Packings with Continuum Glauber Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18748</link><description>arXiv:2601.18748v1 Announce Type: new

As a corollary, we improve the threshold up to which packings of a fixed number of spheres can be sampled from a bounded domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18748v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Let's Make Every Pull Request Meaningful: An Empirical Analysis of Developer and Agentic Pull Requests</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18749</link><description>arXiv:2601.18749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic generation of pull requests (PRs) using AI agents has become increasingly common. Although AI-generated PRs are fast and easy to create, their merge rates have been reported to be lower than those created by humans. In this study, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of 40,214 PRs collected from the AIDev dataset. We extract 64 features across six families and fit statistical regression models to compare PR merge outcomes for human and agentic PRs, as well as across three AI agents. Our results show that submitter attributes dominate merge outcomes for both groups, while review-related features exhibit contrasting effects between human and agentic PRs. The findings of this study provide insights into improving PR quality through human-AI collaboration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Anticipation in Action: Evaluating Stimulus-Preceding Negativity as an Implicit Trigger for Adaptive Mixed Reality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18750</link><description>arXiv:2601.18750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) interfaces increasingly rely on gaze for interaction , yet distinguishing visual attention from intentional action remains difficult, leading to the Midas Touch problem. Existing solutions require explicit confirmations, while brain-computer interfaces may provide an implicit marker of intention using Stimulus-Preceding Negativity (SPN). We investigated how Intention (Select vs. Observe) and Feedback (With vs. Without) modulate SPN during gaze-based MR interactions. During realistic selection tasks, we acquired EEG and eye-tracking data from 28 participants. SPN was robustly elicited and sensitive to both factors: observation without feedback produced the strongest amplitudes, while intention to select and expectation of feedback reduced activity, suggesting SPN reflects anticipatory uncertainty rather than motor preparation. Complementary decoding with deep learning models achieved reliable person-dependent classification of user intention, with accuracies ranging from 75% to 97% across participants. These findings identify SPN as an implicit marker for building intention-aware MR interfaces that mitigate the Midas Touch.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18750v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HalluGuard: Demystifying Data-Driven and Reasoning-Driven Hallucinations in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18753</link><description>arXiv:2601.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and scientific discovery is often compromised by hallucinations. These failures typically stem from two sources: data-driven hallucinations and reasoning-driven hallucinations. However, existing detection methods usually address only one source and rely on task-specific heuristics, limiting their generalization to complex scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Hallucination Risk Bound, a unified theoretical framework that formally decomposes hallucination risk into data-driven and reasoning-driven components, linked respectively to training-time mismatches and inference-time instabilities. This provides a principled foundation for analyzing how hallucinations emerge and evolve. Building on this foundation, we introduce HalluGuard, an NTK-based score that leverages the induced geometry and captured representations of the NTK to jointly identify data-driven and reasoning-driven hallucinations. We evaluate HalluGuard on 10 diverse benchmarks, 11 competitive baselines, and 9 popular LLM backbones, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in detecting diverse forms of LLM hallucinations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18753v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] $\alpha^3$-SecBench: A Large-Scale Evaluation Suite of Security, Resilience, and Trust for LLM-based UAV Agents over 6G Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18754</link><description>arXiv:2601.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical, networked environments where they must operate reliably in the presence of malicious adversaries. While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings.
  We introduce $\alpha^{3}$-SecBench, the first large-scale evaluation suite for assessing the security-aware autonomy of LLM-based UAV agents under realistic adversarial interference. Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $\alpha^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $\alpha^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage).
  We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent. Normalized overall scores range from 12.9% to 57.1%, highlighting a significant gap between anomaly detection and security-aware autonomous decision-making.

Abstract: In this work, we design and analyze semi/fully-discrete virtual element approximations for the time-dependent Navier--Stokes-Cahn--Hilliard equations, modeling the dynamics of two-phase incompressible fluid flows with diffuse interfaces. A new variational formulation is derived involving solely the velocity, pressure, and phase field, together with corresponding a priori energy estimates. The spatial discretization is based on the coupling divergence-free and $C^1$-conforming elements of high-order, while the time discretization employs a classical backward Euler scheme. By introducing a novel skew-symmetric trilinear form to discretize the convective term in the Cahn--Hilliard equation, we propose discrete schemes that satisfy mass conservation and energy bounds. Moreover, optimal error estimates are provided for both formulations. Finally, two numerical experiments are presented to support our theoretical findings and to illustrate the good performance of the proposed schemes for different polynomial degrees and polygonal meshes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18758v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UI Remix: Supporting UI Design Through Interactive Example Retrieval and Remixing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18759</link><description>arXiv:2601.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing user interfaces (UIs) is a critical step when launching products, building portfolios, or personalizing projects, yet end users without design expertise often struggle to articulate their intent and to trust design choices. Existing example-based tools either promote broad exploration, which can cause overwhelm and design drift, or require adapting a single example, risking design fixation. We present UI Remix, an interactive system that supports mobile UI design through an example-driven design workflow. Powered by a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MMRAG) model, UI Remix enables iterative search, selection, and adaptation of examples at both the global (whole interface) and local (component) level. To foster trust, it presents source transparency cues such as ratings, download counts, and developer information. In an empirical study with 24 end users, UI Remix significantly improved participants' ability to achieve their design goals, facilitated effective iteration, and encouraged exploration of alternative designs. Participants also reported that source transparency cues enhanced their confidence in adapting examples. Our findings suggest new directions for AI-assisted, example-driven systems that empower end users to design with greater control, trust, and openness to exploration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18759v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Preferences: Learning Alignment Principles Grounded in Human Reasons and Values</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18760</link><description>arXiv:2601.18760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial consideration when developing and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) is the human values to which these models are aligned. In the constitutional framework of alignment models are aligned to a set of principles (the constitution) specified in natural language. However, it is unclear how to fairly determine this constitution with widespread stakeholder input. In this work we propose Grounded Constitutional AI (GCAI), a unified framework for generating constitutions of principles that are representative of both users' general expectations toward AI (general principles) and their interaction-time preferences (contextual principles). We extend the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) approach to generate contextual principles from human preference annotation data by leveraging human-provided \textit{reasons} for their preferences. We supplement these contextual principles with general principles surfaced from user statements of \textit{values} regarding AI. We show that a constitution generated by GCAI is preferred by humans over one generated through ICAI both personally, and for widespread use in governing AI behavior. Additionally participants consider the GCAI constitution to be more morally grounded, coherent, and pluralistic.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18760v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Access Control to Usage Control with User-Managed Access</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18761</link><description>arXiv:2601.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent data protection and data governance regulations have intensified the demand for interoperable, decentralized data ecosystems that can support not only access control but also legally-aligned governance over data use. Existing Web-based data storage platforms increasingly struggle to meet these regulatory and practical requirements, as their authorization mechanisms rely on tightly coupled, document-centric access control models that lack expressiveness for legal constraints and fail to separate data management from authorization concerns. In parallel, widely adopted authorization standards remain poorly aligned with decentralized, semantically rich usage-control scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces an architecture that replaces Solid's native access control mechanisms with a UMA authorization flow, enabling the enforcement of usage control policies expressed with the W3C ODRL standard. This article details the conceptual background motivating this approach, presents the proposed UMA-based architecture, and describes a prototype implementation that integrates an ODRL-enabled Authorization Server with a Solid-compatible Resource Server. The prototype demonstrates that decoupling authorization from storage enables more flexible, interoperable, and legally expressive control over data use, while remaining compatible with existing Solid infrastructure. It also highlights practical design choices required to evaluate ODRL policies in the absence of a fully standardized evaluation semantics. Moreover, this work shows how usage control can be operationalized using existing Web standards, offering a concrete path beyond permission-based access control toward policy-aware, legally informed data governance. Future research will focus on policy management interfaces, richer claim verification mechanisms, and techniques for communicating and enforcing obligations over time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18761v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Goal-oriented Communication for Fast and Robust Robotic Fault Detection and Recovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18765</link><description>arXiv:2601.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems are widely deployed in smart factories and operate in dynamic, uncertain, and human-involved environments that require low-latency and robust fault detection and recovery (FDR). However, existing FDR frameworks exhibit various limitations, such as significant delays in communication and computation, and unreliability in robot motion/trajectory generation, mainly because the communication-computation-control (3C) loop is designed without considering the downstream FDR goal. To address this, we propose a novel Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) framework that jointly designs the 3C loop tailored for fast and robust robotic FDR, with the goal of minimising the FDR time while maximising the robotic task (e.g., workpiece sorting) success rate. For fault detection, our GoC framework innovatively defines and extracts the 3D scene graph (3D-SG) as the semantic representation via our designed representation extractor, and detects faults by monitoring spatial relationship changes in the 3D-SG. For fault recovery, we fine-tune a small language model (SLM) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and enhance its reasoning and generalization capabilities via knowledge distillation to generate recovery motions for robots. We also design a lightweight goal-oriented digital twin reconstruction module to refine the recovery motions generated by the SLM when fine-grained robotic control is required, using only task-relevant object contours for digital twin reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our GoC framework reduces the FDR time by up to 82.6% and improves the task success rate by up to 76%, compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks that rely on vision language models for fault detection and large language models for fault recovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18765v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dep-Search: Learning Dependency-Aware Reasoning Traces with Persistent Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18771</link><description>arXiv:2601.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, particularly when augmented with search mechanisms that enable systematic exploration of external knowledge bases. The field has evolved from traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks to more sophisticated search-based frameworks that orchestrate multi-step reasoning through explicit search strategies. However, existing search frameworks still rely heavily on implicit natural language reasoning to determine search strategies and how to leverage retrieved information across reasoning steps. This reliance on implicit reasoning creates fundamental challenges for managing dependencies between sub-questions, efficiently reusing previously retrieved knowledge, and learning optimal search strategies through reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we propose Dep-Search, a dependency-aware search framework that advances beyond existing search frameworks by integrating structured reasoning, retrieval, and persistent memory through GRPO. Dep-Search introduces explicit control mechanisms that enable the model to decompose questions with dependency relationships, retrieve information when needed, access previously stored knowledge from memory, and summarize long reasoning contexts into reusable memory entries. Through extensive experiments on seven diverse question answering datasets, we demonstrate that Dep-Search significantly enhances LLMs' ability to tackle complex multi-hop reasoning tasks, achieving substantial improvements over strong baselines across different model scales.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18771v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are Conversational AI Agents the Way Out?

Abstract: Recent discussions at the intersection of journalism, HCI, and human-centered computing ask how technologies can help create reader-oriented news experiences. The current paper takes up this initiative by focusing on immigrant readers, a group who reports significant difficulties engaging with mainstream news yet has received limited attention in prior research. We report findings from our co-design research with eleven immigrant readers living in the United States and seven journalists working in the same region, aiming to enhance the news experience of the former. Data collected from all participants revealed an "unaddressed-or-unaccountable" paradox that challenges value alignment across immigrant readers and journalists. This paradox points to four metaphors regarding how conversational AI agents can be designed to assist news reading. Each metaphor requires conversational AI, journalists, and immigrant readers to coordinate their shared responsibilities in a distinct manner. These findings provide insights into reader-oriented news experiences with AI in the loop.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18772v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PRECISE: Reducing the Bias of LLM Evaluations Using Prediction-Powered Ranking Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18777</link><description>arXiv:2601.18777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of search, ranking and RAG systems traditionally requires a significant number of human relevance annotations. In recent times, several deployed systems have explored the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated judges for this task while their inherent biases prevent direct use for metric estimation. We present a statistical framework extending Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) that combines minimal human annotations with LLM judgments to produce reliable estimates of metrics which require sub-instance annotations. Our method requires as few as 100 human-annotated queries and 10,000 unlabeled examples, reducing annotation requirements significantly compared to traditional approaches. We formulate our proposed framework (PRECISE) for inference of relevance uplift for an LLM-based query reformulation application, extending PPI to sub-instance annotations at the query-document level. By reformulating the metric-integration space, we reduced the computational complexity from O(2^|C|) to O(2^K), where |C| represents corpus size (in order of millions). Detailed experiments across prominent retrieval datasets demonstrate that our method reduces the variance of estimates for the business-critical Precision@K metric, while effectively correcting for LLM bias in low-resource settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18777v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Teaching Models to Teach Themselves: Reasoning at the Edge of Learnability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18778</link><description>arXiv:2601.18778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a model learn to escape its own learning plateau? Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large reasoning models stall on datasets with low initial success rates, and thus little training signal. We investigate a fundamental question: Can a pretrained LLM leverage latent knowledge to generate an automated curriculum for problems it cannot solve? To explore this, we design SOAR: A self-improvement framework designed to surface these pedagogical signals through meta-RL. A teacher copy of the model proposes synthetic problems for a student copy, and is rewarded with its improvement on a small subset of hard problems. Critically, SOAR grounds the curriculum in measured student progress rather than intrinsic proxy rewards. Our study on the hardest subsets of mathematical benchmarks (0/128 success) reveals three core findings. First, we show that it is possible to realize bi-level meta-RL that unlocks learning under sparse, binary rewards by sharpening a latent capacity of pretrained models to generate useful stepping stones. Second, grounded rewards outperform intrinsic reward schemes used in prior LLM self-play, reliably avoiding the instability and diversity collapse modes they typically exhibit. Third, analyzing the generated questions reveals that structural quality and well-posedness are more critical for learning progress than solution correctness. Our results suggest that the ability to generate useful stepping stones does not require the preexisting ability to actually solve the hard problems, paving a principled path to escape reasoning plateaus without additional curated data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18778v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] POPE: Learning to Reason on Hard Problems via Privileged On-Policy Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18779</link><description>arXiv:2601.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet state-of-the-art methods still fail to learn on many training problems. On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT). POPE augments hard problems with prefixes of oracle solutions, enabling RL to obtain non-zero rewards during guided rollouts. Crucially, the resulting behaviors transfer back to the original, unguided problems through a synergy between instruction-following and reasoning. Empirically, POPE expands the set of solvable problems and substantially improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18779v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Tactical Decision Making for Trucks in Highway Traffic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18783</link><description>arXiv:2601.18783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing safety, efficiency, and operational costs in highway driving poses a challenging decision-making problem for heavy-duty vehicles. A central difficulty is that conventional scalar reward formulations, obtained by aggregating these competing objectives, often obscure the structure of their trade-offs. We present a Proximal Policy Optimization based multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that learns a continuous set of policies explicitly representing these trade-offs and evaluates it on a scalable simulation platform for tactical decision making in trucks. The proposed approach learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies that capture the trade-offs among three conflicting objectives: safety, quantified in terms of collisions and successful completion; energy efficiency and time efficiency, quantified using energy cost and driver cost, respectively. The resulting Pareto frontier is smooth and interpretable, enabling flexibility in choosing driving behavior along different conflicting objectives. This framework allows seamless transitions between different driving policies without retraining, yielding a robust and adaptive decision-making strategy for autonomous trucking applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18783v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Design Techniques for LLM-Powered Interactive Storytelling: A Case Study of the Dramamancer System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18785</link><description>arXiv:2601.18785v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Unsupervised text segmentation is crucial because boundary labels are expensive, subjective, and often fail to transfer across domains and granularity choices. We propose Embed-KCPD, a training-free method that represents sentences as embedding vectors and estimates boundaries by minimizing a penalized KCPD objective. Beyond the algorithmic instantiation, we develop, to our knowledge, the first dependence-aware theory for KCPD under $m$-dependent sequences, a finite-memory abstraction of short-range dependence common in language. We prove an oracle inequality for the population penalized risk and a localization guarantee showing that each true change point is recovered within a window that is small relative to segment length. To connect theory to practice, we introduce an LLM-based simulation framework that generates synthetic documents with controlled finite-memory dependence and known boundaries, validating the predicted scaling behavior. Across standard segmentation benchmarks, Embed-KCPD often outperforms strong unsupervised baselines. A case study on Taylor Swift's tweets illustrates that Embed-KCPD combines strong theoretical guarantees, simulated reliability, and practical effectiveness for text segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18788v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MortalMATH: Evaluating the Conflict Between Reasoning Objectives and Emergency Contexts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18790</link><description>arXiv:2601.18790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly optimized for deep reasoning, prioritizing the correct execution of complex tasks over general conversation. We investigate whether this focus on calculation creates a "tunnel vision" that ignores safety in critical situations. We introduce MortalMATH, a benchmark of 150 scenarios where users request algebra help while describing increasingly life-threatening emergencies (e.g., stroke symptoms, freefall). We find a sharp behavioral split: generalist models (like Llama-3.1) successfully refuse the math to address the danger. In contrast, specialized reasoning models (like Qwen-3-32b and GPT-5-nano) often ignore the emergency entirely, maintaining over 95 percent task completion rates while the user describes dying. Furthermore, the computational time required for reasoning introduces dangerous delays: up to 15 seconds before any potential help is offered. These results suggest that training models to relentlessly pursue correct answers may inadvertently unlearn the survival instincts required for safe deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18790v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MEGnifying Emotion: Sentiment Analysis from Annotated Brain Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18792</link><description>arXiv:2601.18792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding emotion from brain activity could unlock a deeper understanding of the human experience. While a number of existing datasets align brain data with speech and with speech transcripts, no datasets have annotated brain data with sentiment. To bridge this gap, we explore the use of pre-trained Text-to-Sentiment models to annotate non invasive brain recordings, acquired using magnetoencephalography (MEG), while participants listened to audiobooks. Having annotated the text, we employ force-alignment of the text and audio to align our sentiment labels with the brain recordings. It is straightforward then to train Brainto-Sentiment models on these data. Experimental results show an improvement in balanced accuracy for Brain-to-Sentiment compared to baseline, supporting the proposed approach as a proof-of-concept for leveraging existing MEG datasets and learning to decode sentiment directly from the brain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18792v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Handling Scope Checks (Extended Version)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18793</link><description>arXiv:2601.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaprogramming and effect handlers interact in unexpected, and sometimes undesirable, ways. One example is scope extrusion: the generation of ill-scoped code. Scope extrusion can either be preemptively prevented, via static type systems, or retroactively detected, via dynamic checks. Static type systems exist in theory, but struggle with a range of implementation and usability problems in practice. In contrast, dynamic checks exist in practice (e.g. in MetaOCaml), but are understudied in theory. Designers of metalanguages are thus given little guidance regarding the design and implementation of checks. We present the first formal study of dynamic scope extrusion checks, introducing a calculus ($\lambda_{\langle\langle\text{op}\rangle\rangle}$) for describing and evaluating checks. Further, we introduce a novel dynamic check $\unicode{x2014}$ the "Cause-for-Concern" check $\unicode{x2014}$ which we prove correct, characterise without reference to its implementation, and argue combines the advantages of existing dynamic checks. Finally, we extend our framework with refined environment classifiers, which statically prevent scope extrusion, and compare their expressivity with the dynamic checks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18793v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reuse your FLOPs: Scaling RL on Hard Problems by Conditioning on Very Off-Policy Prefixes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18795</link><description>arXiv:2601.18795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods for LLM reasoning waste compute on hard problems, where correct on-policy traces are rare, policy gradients vanish, and learning stalls. To bootstrap more efficient RL, we consider reusing old sampling FLOPs (from prior inference or RL training) in the form of off-policy traces. Standard off-policy methods supervise against off-policy data, causing instabilities during RL optimization. We introduce PrefixRL, where we condition on the prefix of successful off-policy traces and run on-policy RL to complete them, side-stepping off-policy instabilities. PrefixRL boosts the learning signal on hard problems by modulating the difficulty of the problem through the off-policy prefix length. We prove that the PrefixRL objective is not only consistent with the standard RL objective but also more sample efficient. Empirically, we discover back-generalization: training only on prefixed problems generalizes to out-of-distribution unprefixed performance, with learned strategies often differing from those in the prefix. In our experiments, we source the off-policy traces by rejection sampling with the base model, creating a self-improvement loop. On hard reasoning problems, PrefixRL reaches the same training reward 2x faster than the strongest baseline (SFT on off-policy data then RL), even after accounting for the compute spent on the initial rejection sampling, and increases the final reward by 3x. The gains transfer to held-out benchmarks, and PrefixRL is still effective when off-policy traces are derived from a different model family, validating its flexibility in practical settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18795v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ctELM: Decoding and Manipulating Embeddings of Clinical Trials with Embedding Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18796</link><description>arXiv:2601.18796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text embeddings have become an essential part of a variety of language applications. However, methods for interpreting, exploring and reversing embedding spaces are limited, reducing transparency and precluding potentially valuable generative use cases. In this work, we align Large Language Models to embeddings of clinical trials using the recently reported Embedding Language Model (ELM) method. We develop an open-source, domain-agnostic ELM architecture and training framework, design training tasks for clinical trials, and introduce an expert-validated synthetic dataset. We then train a series of ELMs exploring the impact of tasks and training regimes. Our final model, ctELM, can accurately describe and compare unseen clinical trials from embeddings alone and produce plausible clinical trials from novel vectors. We further show that generated trial abstracts are responsive to moving embeddings along concept vectors for age and sex of study subjects. Our public ELM implementation and experimental results will aid the alignment of Large Language Models to embedding spaces in the biomedical domain and beyond.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18796v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Weighted Birkhoff averages: Deterministic and probabilistic perspectives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03210</link><description>arXiv:2505.03210v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we survey physically related applications of a class of weighted quasi-Monte Carlo methods from a theoretical, deterministic perspective, and establish quantitative universal rapid convergence results via various regularity assumptions. Specifically, we introduce weighting with compact support to the Birkhoff ergodic averages of quasi-periodic, almost periodic, and periodic systems, thereby achieving universal rapid convergence, including both arbitrary polynomial and exponential types. This is in stark contrast to the typically slow convergence in classical ergodic theory. As new contributions, we not only discuss more general weighting functions but also provide quantitative improvements to existing results; the explicit regularity settings facilitate the application of these methods to specific problems. We also revisit the physically related problems and, for the first time, establish universal exponential convergence results for the weighted computation of Fourier coefficients, in both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional cases. In addition to the above, we explore results from a probabilistic perspective, including the weighted strong law of large numbers and the weighted central limit theorem, by building upon the historical results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.03210v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Voice of Equity: A Systematic Evaluation of Bias Mitigation Techniques for Speech-Based Cognitive Impairment Detection Across Architectures and Demographics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16989</link><description>arXiv:2601.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-based detection of cognitive impairment offers a scalable, non-invasive screening, yet algorithmic bias across demographic and linguistic subgroups remains critically underexplored. We present the first comprehensive fairness analysis framework for speech-based multi-class cognitive impairment detection, systematically evaluating bias mitigation across architectures, and demographic subgroups. We developed two transformer-based architectures, SpeechCARE-AGF and Whisper-LWF-LoRA, on the multilingual NIA PREPARE Challenge dataset. Unlike prior work that typically examines single mitigation techniques, we compared pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing approaches, assessing fairness via Equality of Opportunity and Equalized Odds across gender, age, education, and language. Both models achieved strong performance (F1: SpeechCARE-AGF 70.87, Whisper-LWF-LoRA 71.46) but exhibited substantial fairness disparities. Adults &gt;=80 showed lower sensitivity versus younger groups; Spanish speakers demonstrated reduced TPR versus English speakers. Mitigation effectiveness varied by architecture: oversampling improved SpeechCARE-AGF for older adults (80+ TPR: 46.19%=&gt;49.97%) but minimally affected Whisper-LWF-LoRA. This study addresses a critical healthcare AI gap by demonstrating that architectural design fundamentally shapes bias patterns and mitigation effectiveness. Adaptive fusion mechanisms enable flexible responses to data interventions, while frequency reweighting offers robust improvements across architectures. Our findings establish that fairness interventions must be tailored to both model architecture and demographic characteristics, providing a systematic framework for developing equitable speech-based screening tools essential for reducing diagnostic disparities in cognitive healthcare.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16989v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BickGraphing: Web-Based Application for Visual Inspection of Audio Recordings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17014</link><description>arXiv:2601.17014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BickGraphing is a browser based research tool that enables visual inspection of acoustic recordings. The tool was built in support of visualizing crop feeding pest sounds in support of the Insect Eavesdropper project; however, it is widely applicable to all audiovisualizations in research. It allows multiple uploads of large .wav files, computes waveforms and spectrograms locally, and supports interactive exploration of audio events in time and frequency. The application is implemented as a SvelteKit and TypeScript web app with a client side signal processing pipeline using WebAssembly compiled FFmpeg and custom FFT utilities. The software is released on an open Git repository (https://github.com/bicklabuw/BickGraphing) and archived under a standard MIT license and can be reused for rapid visual quality checks of .wav recordings in insect bioacoustics and related fields. BickGraphing has the potential to be a local, easy to use coding free visualization platform for audio data in research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Regret-Driven Portfolios: LLM-Guided Smart Clustering for Optimal Allocation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17021</link><description>arXiv:2601.17021v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Information can evolve as a physical consequence of non-equilibrium dynamics, even in the absence of genes, replication, or predefined fitness functions. We present Stability-Driven Assembly (SDA), a framework in which stochastic assembly combined with differential persistence biases populations toward longer-lived motifs. Assemblies that persist longer become more frequent and are therefore more likely to participate in subsequent interactions, generating feedback that reshapes the population distribution and implements fitness-proportional sampling, realizing evolution as a natural, emergent genetic algorithm (SDA/GA) driven solely by stability. We apply SDA/GA to chemical symbol space using SMILES fragments with recombination, mutation, and a heuristic stability function. Simulations show hallmark features of evolutionary search, including scaffold-level dominance, sustained novelty, and entropy reduction, yielding open-ended dynamics absent from equilibrium models with fixed transition rates. These results motivate an evolutionary ladder hypothesis where persistence-driven selection precedes genetic replication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17061v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PC-MCL: Patient-Consistent Multi-Cycle Learning with multi-label bias correction for respiratory sound classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17080</link><description>arXiv:2601.17080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated respiratory sound classification supports the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. However, many deep models still rely on cycle-level analysis and suffer from patient-specific overfitting. We propose PC-MCL (Patient-Consistent Multi-Cycle Learning) to address these limitations by utilizing three key components: multi-cycle concatenation, a 3-label formulation, and a patient-matching auxiliary task. Our work resolves a multi-label distributional bias in respiratory sound classification, a critical issue inherent to applying multi-cycle concatenation with the conventional 2-label formulation (crackle, wheeze). This bias manifests as a systematic loss of normal signal information when normal and abnormal cycles are combined. Our proposed 3-label formulation (normal, crackle, wheeze) corrects this by preserving information from all constituent cycles in mixed samples. Furthermore, the patient-matching auxiliary task acts as a multi-task regularizer, encouraging the model to learn more robust features and improving generalization. On the ICBHI 2017 benchmark, PC-MCL achieves an ICBHI Score of 65.37%, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies confirm that all three components are essential, working synergistically to improve the detection of abnormal respiratory events.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17080v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ChemNavigator: Agentic AI Discovery of Design Rules for Organic Photocatalysts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17084</link><description>arXiv:2601.17084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance organic photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution remains limited by the vastness of chemical space and the reliance on human intuition for molecular design. Here we present ChemNavigator, an agentic AI system that autonomously derives structure-property relationships through hypothesis-driven exploration of organic photocatalyst candidates. The system integrates large language model reasoning with density functional tight binding calculations in a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the scientific method: formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, executing calculations, and validating findings through rigorous statistical analysis. Through iterative discovery cycles encompassing 200 molecules, ChemNavigator autonomously identified six statistically significant design rules governing frontier orbital energies, including the effects of ether linkages, carbonyl groups, extended conjugation, cyano groups, halogen substituents, and amine groups. Importantly, these rules correspond to established principles of organic electronic structure (resonance donation, inductive withdrawal, $\pi$-delocalization), demonstrating that the system can independently derive chemical knowledge without explicit programming. Notably, autonomous agentic reasoning extracted these six validated rules from a molecular library where previous ML approaches identified only carbonyl effects. Furthermore, the quantified effect sizes provide a prioritized ranking for synthetic chemists, while feature interaction analysis revealed diminishing returns when combining strategies, challenging additive assumptions in molecular design. This work demonstrates that agentic AI systems can autonomously derive interpretable, chemically grounded design principles, establishing a framework for AI-assisted materials discovery that complements rather than replaces chemical intuition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17084v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recovering Performance in Speech Emotion Recognition from Discrete Tokens via Multi-Layer Fusion and Paralinguistic Feature Integration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17085</link><description>arXiv:2601.17085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete speech tokens offer significant advantages for storage and language model integration, but their application in speech emotion recognition (SER) is limited by paralinguistic information loss during quantization. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of discrete tokens for SER. Using a fine-tuned WavLM-Large model, we systematically quantify performance degradation across different layer configurations and k-means quantization granularities. To recover the information loss, we propose two key strategies: (1) attention-based multi-layer fusion to recapture complementary information from different layers, and (2) integration of openSMILE features to explicitly reintroduce paralinguistic cues. We also compare mainstream neural codec tokenizers (SpeechTokenizer, DAC, EnCodec) and analyze their behaviors when fused with acoustic features. Our findings demonstrate that through multi-layer fusion and acoustic feature integration, discrete tokens can close the performance gap with continuous representations in SER tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17085v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EveNet: A Foundation Model for Particle Collision Data Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17126</link><description>arXiv:2601.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep learning is transforming data analysis in high-energy physics, computational challenges limit its potential. We address these challenges in the context of collider physics by introducing EveNet, an event-level foundation model pretrained on 500 million simulated collision events using a hybrid objective of self-supervised learning and physics-informed supervision. By leveraging a shared particle-cloud representation, EveNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse tasks, including searches for heavy resonances and exotic Higgs decays, and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in low-statistics regimes. Crucially, we validate the transferability of the model to experimental data by rediscovering the $\Upsilon$ meson in CMS Open Data and show its capacity for precision physics through the robust extraction of quantum correlation observables stable against systematic uncertainties. These results indicate that EveNet can successfully encode the fundamental physical structure of particle interactions, which offers a unified and resource-efficient framework to accelerate discovery at current and future colliders.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17126v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Falsifying Predictive Algorithm</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17146</link><description>arXiv:2601.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical investigations into unintended model behavior often show that the algorithm is predicting another outcome than what was intended. These exposes highlight the need to identify when algorithms predict unintended quantities - ideally before deploying them into consequential settings. We propose a falsification framework that provides a principled statistical test for discriminant validity: the requirement that an algorithm predict intended outcomes better than impermissible ones. Drawing on falsification practices from causal inference, econometrics, and psychometrics, our framework compares calibrated prediction losses across outcomes to assess whether the algorithm exhibits discriminant validity with respect to a specified impermissible proxy. In settings where the target outcome is difficult to observe, multiple permissible proxy outcomes may be available; our framework accommodates both this setting and the case with a single permissible proxy. Throughout we use nonparametric hypothesis testing methods that make minimal assumptions on the data-generating process. We illustrate the method in an admissions setting, where the framework establishes discriminant validity with respect to gender but fails to establish discriminant validity with respect to race. This demonstrates how falsification can serve as an early validity check, prior to fairness or robustness analyses. We also provide analysis in a criminal justice setting, where we highlight the limitations of our framework and emphasize the need for complementary approaches to assess other aspects of construct validity and external validity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-Efficient Physics-Informed Learning to Model Synchro-Waveform Dynamics of Grid-Integrated Inverter-Based Resources</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17154</link><description>arXiv:2601.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverter-based resources (IBRs) exhibit fast transient dynamics during network disturbances, which often cannot be properly captured by phasor and SCADA measurements. This shortcoming has recently been addressed with the advent of waveform measurement units (WMUs), which provide high-resolution, time-synchronized raw voltage and current waveform samples from multiple locations in the power system. However, transient model learning based on synchro-waveform measurements remains constrained by the scarcity of network disturbances and the complexity of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of IBRs. We propose to address these problems by developing a data-efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework for synchro-waveform analytics that estimates the IBR terminal current response from only a few network disturbance signatures. Here, the physics of the electrical circuits are used to compensate for limited data availability by constraining the learning process through known circuit relationships. Two cases are considered, with known and unknown circuit parameters. In the latter case, the framework jointly learns the transient dynamics of the IBRs and the parameters of the electrical circuit. Case studies using WMU disturbance data across multiple sampling rates shows consistently lower current estimation error with substantially fewer training events than a purely data-driven baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17154v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-Driven Information-Theoretic Causal Bounds under Unmeasured Confounding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17160</link><description>arXiv:2601.17160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a data-driven information-theoretic framework for sharp partial identification of causal effects under unmeasured confounding. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as bounded or discrete outcomes; require external inputs (for example, instrumental variables, proxies, or user-specified sensitivity parameters); necessitate full structural causal model specifications; or focus solely on population-level averages while neglecting covariate-conditional treatment effects. We overcome all four limitations simultaneously by establishing novel information-theoretic, data-driven divergence bounds. Our key theoretical contribution shows that the f-divergence between the observational distribution P(Y | A = a, X = x) and the interventional distribution P(Y | do(A = a), X = x) is upper bounded by a function of the propensity score alone. This result enables sharp partial identification of conditional causal effects directly from observational data, without requiring external sensitivity parameters, auxiliary variables, full structural specifications, or outcome boundedness assumptions. For practical implementation, we develop a semiparametric estimator satisfying Neyman orthogonality (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), which ensures square-root-n consistent inference even when nuisance functions are estimated using flexible machine learning methods. Simulation studies and real-world data applications, implemented in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/yonghanjung/Information-Theretic-Bounds), demonstrate that our framework provides tight and valid causal bounds across a wide range of data-generating processes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17160v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Deep Learning-Based Reconstruction Methods for Photoacoustic Computed Tomography with Clinically Relevant Synthetic Datasets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17165</link><description>arXiv:2601.17165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image reconstruction methods for photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) have developed rapidly in recent years. However, most existing methods have not employed standardized datasets, and their evaluations rely on traditional image quality (IQ) metrics that may lack clinical relevance. The absence of a standardized framework for clinically meaningful IQ assessment hinders fair comparison and raises concerns about the reproducibility and reliability of reported advancements in PACT. A benchmarking framework is proposed that provides open-source, anatomically plausible synthetic datasets and evaluation strategies for DL-based acoustic inversion methods in PACT. The datasets each include over 11,000 two-dimensional (2D) stochastic breast objects with clinically relevant lesions and paired measurements at varying modeling complexity. The evaluation strategies incorporate both traditional and task-based IQ measures to assess fidelity and clinical utility. A preliminary benchmarking study is conducted to demonstrate the framework's utility by comparing DL-based and physics-based reconstruction methods. The benchmarking study demonstrated that the proposed framework enabled comprehensive, quantitative comparisons of reconstruction performance and revealed important limitations in certain DL-based methods. Although they performed well according to traditional IQ measures, they often failed to accurately recover lesions. This highlights the inadequacy of traditional metrics and motivates the need for task-based assessments. The proposed benchmarking framework enables systematic comparisons of DL-based acoustic inversion methods for 2D PACT. By integrating clinically relevant synthetic datasets with rigorous evaluation protocols, it enables reproducible, objective assessments and facilitates method development and system optimization in PACT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17165v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Complexity of the Feedback Vertex Set Problem in Tournaments with Forbidden Subtournaments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17169</link><description>arXiv:2601.17169v1 Announce Type: cross

The MFBVS problem in general tournaments is known to be NP-complete. We prove that the MFBVS problem for $W_5$-free and $U_5$-free tournaments is in P, and for $T_5$-free tournaments it remains NP-complete. Moreover, we prove a necessary condition for all $H$ such that the MFBVS problem for $H$-free tournaments is in P. We also show that the necessary condition is not sufficient.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17169v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FASTR: Reimagining FASTQ via Compact Image-inspired Representation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17184</link><description>arXiv:2601.17184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) enables population-scale genomics but generates massive datasets, creating bottlenecks in storage, transfer, and analysis. FASTQ, the standard format for over two decades, stores one byte per base and one byte per quality score, leading to inefficient I/O, high storage costs, and redundancy. Existing compression tools can mitigate some issues, but often introduce costly decompression or complex dependency issues. Results: We introduce FASTR, a lossless, computation-native successor to FASTQ that encodes each nucleotide together with its base quality score into a single 8-bit value. FASTR reduces file size by at least 2x while remaining fully reversible and directly usable for downstream analyses. Applying general-purpose compression tools on FASTR consistently yields higher compression ratios, 2.47, 3.64, and 4.8x faster compression, and 2.34, 1.96, 1.75x faster decompression than on FASTQ across Illumina, HiFi, and ONT reads. FASTR is machine-learning-ready, allowing reads to be consumed directly as numerical vectors or image-like representations. We provide a highly parallel software ecosystem for FASTQ-FASTR conversion and show that FASTR integrates with existing tools, such as minimap2, with minimal interface changes and no performance overhead. By eliminating decompression costs and reducing data movement, FASTR lays the foundation for scalable genomics analyses and real-time sequencing workflows.

Abstract: Accurate redshift estimates are a vital component in understanding galaxy evolution and precision cosmology. In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types. Typical models are trained with ground-truth redshifts from spectroscopy. We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband ($\sim$35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3&lt;1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-$z$'s for a broader population of galaxies crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17222v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fully Turbulent Wakes at Low Reynolds Numbers: the Case of the Thin Flat Plate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17341</link><description>arXiv:2601.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the wake flow past a thin two-dimensional flat plate normal to the uniform stream and demonstrate that this flow is turbulent already at a relatively low Reynolds number of $Re = 400$. This is achieved by performing a careful comparison of the results of a DNS of this flow with experimental measurements of wake flows in the same geometric configuration at the Reynolds numbers of $Re=12500, 19700$. This comparison reveals that the distribution of several key quantities, including the mean velocity, Reynolds stresses and different effects contributing to the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy, are, up to measurement uncertainty, the same in these flows. Moreover, the wake flow at $Re = 400$ also features energy spectra characteristic of turbulent flows with intermittency detected in the distributions of the fluctuating strain and rotation rates. In contrast, these features are absent from the results of the DNS of the wake flow at $Re = 150$ where the distribution of the key quantities is also fundamentally different. These results show that the path to transition to turbulence in the wake past a thin flat plate is different from that in the wakes of canonical (i.e., circular or square) cylinders. We also identify possible physical mechanisms that may be responsible for these differences.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17341v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Error Analysis of Bayesian Inverse Problems with Generative Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17374</link><description>arXiv:2601.17374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven methods for the solution of inverse problems have become widely popular in recent years thanks to the rise of machine learning techniques. A popular approach concerns the training of a generative model on additional data to learn a bespoke prior for the problem at hand. In this article we present an analysis for such problems by presenting quantitative error bounds for minimum Wasserstein-2 generative models for the prior. We show that under some assumptions, the error in the posterior due to the generative prior will inherit the same rate as the prior with respect to the Wasserstein-1 distance. We further present numerical experiments that verify that aspects of our error analysis manifests in some benchmarks followed by an elliptic PDE inverse problem where a generative prior is used to model a non-stationary field.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17374v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Entropy-Guided Agreement-Diversity: A Semi-Supervised Active Learning Framework for Fetal Head Segmentation in Ultrasound</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17460</link><description>arXiv:2601.17460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fetal ultrasound (US) data is often limited due to privacy and regulatory restrictions, posing challenges for training deep learning (DL) models. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) is commonly used for fetal US image analysis, existing SSL methods typically rely on random limited selection, which can lead to suboptimal model performance by overfitting to homogeneous labeled data. To address this, we propose a two-stage Active Learning (AL) sampler, Entropy-Guided Agreement-Diversity (EGAD), for fetal head segmentation. Our method first selects the most uncertain samples using predictive entropy, and then refines the final selection using the agreement-diversity score combining cosine similarity and mutual information. Additionally, our SSL framework employs a consistency learning strategy with feature downsampling to further enhance segmentation performance. In experiments, SSL-EGAD achieves an average Dice score of 94.57\% and 96.32\% on two public datasets for fetal head segmentation, using 5\% and 10\% labeled data for training, respectively. Our method outperforms current SSL models and showcases consistent robustness across diverse pregnancy stage data.

Abstract: Quantum sensors offer significant advantages over classical devices in spatial resolution and sensitivity, enabling transformative applications across materials science, healthcare, and beyond. Their practical performance, however, is often constrained by unmodelled effects, including noise, imperfect state preparation, and non-ideal control fields.
  In this work, we report the first experimental implementation of a graybox modelling strategy for a solid-state open quantum system. The graybox framework integrates a physics-based system model with a data-driven description of experimental imperfections, achieving higher fidelity than purely analytical (whitebox) approaches while requiring fewer training resources than fully deep-learning models. We experimentally validate the method on the task of estimating a static magnetic field using a single-spin quantum sensor, performing Bayesian inference with a graybox model trained on prior experimental data. Using roughly 10,000 training datapoints, the graybox model yields several orders of magnitude improvement in mean squared error over the corresponding physics-only model. These results are broadly applicable to a wide range of quantum sensing platforms, not limited to single-spin systems, and are particularly valuable for real-time adaptive protocols, where model inaccuracies can otherwise lead to suboptimal control and degraded performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17465v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smooth Fractal Trees: Analytic Generators and Discrete Equivalence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17490</link><description>arXiv:2601.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for constructing fractal trees via analytic generator fields, replacing discrete affine transformations and symbolic rewriting rules by the integration of smooth vector fields in an internal state space. In this setting, geometric curves are obtained as projections of generator trajectories, and branching is implemented as a primitive operation through exact inheritance of generator state.
  At every finite depth, the resulting structure is a finite union of analytic curve segments that is smooth across branch events. Two structural results relate this generator-driven construction to classical discrete models of tree-based fractals. First, a combinatorial universality theorem shows that any discrete tree specification, including those arising from iterated function systems and L-systems, can be compiled into an analytic generator tree whose induced discrete scaffold is isomorphic at every finite depth. Second, under standard contractive assumptions, a canopy set equivalence theorem establishes that the accumulation set of analytic branch endpoints coincides with the attractor of the corresponding discrete construction.
  These results separate local geometric regularity from global fractal complexity, showing that fractality is determined by recursive branching and scaling rather than by local non-smoothness. The framework provides a smooth representation of tree-based fractals that preserves both their finite combinatorial structure and their asymptotic limit geometry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17490v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Rebuilding" Statistics in the Age of AI: A Town Hall Discussion on Culture, Infrastructure, and Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17510</link><description>arXiv:2601.17510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents the full, original record of the 2024 Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) town hall, "Statistics in the Age of AI," which convened leading statisticians to discuss how the field is evolving in response to advances in artificial intelligence, foundation models, large-scale empirical modeling, and data-intensive infrastructures.

This document preserves the extended exchanges among panelists and audience members, with minimal editorial intervention, and organizes the conversation around five recurring questions concerning disciplinary culture and practices, data curation and "data work," engagement with modern empirical modeling, training for large-scale AI applications, and partnerships with key AI stakeholders. By providing an archival record of this discussion, the preprint aims to support transparency, community reflection, and ongoing dialogue about the evolving role of statistics in the data- and AI-centric future.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17510v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Expectation Signals: LLM-Based Experiments and a Behavioral Kalman Filter Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17527</link><description>arXiv:2601.17527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As LLMs increasingly function as economic agents, the specific mechanisms LLMs use to update their belief with heterogeneous signals remain opaque. We design experiments and develop a Behavioral Kalman Filter framework to quantify how LLM-based agents update expectations, acting as households or firm CEOs, update expectations when presented with individual and aggregate signals. The results from experiments and model estimation reveal four consistent patterns: (1) agents' weighting of priors and signals deviates from unity; (2) both household and firm CEO agents place substantially larger weights on individual signals compared to aggregate signals; (3) we identify a significant and negative interaction between concurrent signals, implying that the presence of multiple information sources diminishes the marginal weight assigned to each individual signal; and (4) expectation formation patterns differ significantly between household and firm CEO agents. Finally, we demonstrate that LoRA fine-tuning mitigates, but does not fully eliminate, behavioral biases in LLM expectation formation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] In-situ On-demand Digital Image Correlation: A New Data-rich Characterization Paradigm for Deformation and Damage Development in Solids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17545</link><description>arXiv:2601.17545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital image correlation (DIC) has become one of the most popular methods for deformation characterization in experimental mechanics. DIC is based on optical images taken during experimentation and post-test image processing. Its advantages include the capability to capture full-field deformation in a non-contact manner, the robustness in characterizing excessive deformation induced by events such as yielding and cracking, and the versatility to integrate optical cameras with a variety of open-source and commercial codes. In this paper, we developed a new paradigm of DIC analysis by integrating camera control into the DIC process flow. The essential idea is to dynamically increase the camera imaging frame rate with excessive deformation or deformation rate, while maintaining a relatively low imaging frame rate with small and slow deformation. We refer to this new DIC paradigm as in-situ on-demand (ISOD) DIC. ISOD DIC enables real-time deformation analysis, visualization, and closed-loop camera control. ISOD DIC has captured approximately 178% more images than conventional DIC for samples undergoing crack growth due to its dynamically adjusted frame rate, with the potential to significantly enhance data richness for damage inspection without consuming excessive storage space and analysis time, thereby benefiting the characterization of intrinsic constitutive behaviors and damage mechanisms</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17545v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spoofing-Aware Speaker Verification via Wavelet Prompt Tuning and Multi-Model Ensembles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17557</link><description>arXiv:2601.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the UZH-CL system submitted to the SASV section of the WildSpoof 2026 challenge. The challenge focuses on the integrated defense against generative spoofing attacks by requiring the simultaneous verification of speaker identity and audio authenticity.

Abstract: Preparing high-quality 360-degree video for HTTP Adaptive Streaming requires encoding each sequence into multiple representations spanning different resolutions and quantization parameters (QPs). For ultra-high-resolution immersive content such as 8K 360-degree video, this process is computationally intensive due to the large number of representations and the high complexity of modern codecs. This paper investigates fast multirate encoding strategies that reduce encoding time by reusing encoder analysis information across QPs and resolutions. We evaluate two cross-resolution information-reuse pipelines that differ in how reference encodes propagate across resolutions: (i) a strict HD -&gt; 4K -&gt; 8K cascade with scaled analysis reuse, and (ii) a resolution-anchored scheme that initializes each resolution with its own highest-bitrate reference before guiding dependent encodes. In addition to evaluating these pipelines on standard equirectangular projection content, we also apply the same two pipelines to cubemap-projection (CMP) tiling, where each 360-degree frame is partitioned into independently encoded tiles. CMP introduces substantial parallelism, while still benefiting from the proposed multirate analysis-reuse strategies. Experimental results using the SJTU 8K 360-degree dataset show that hierarchical analysis reuse significantly accelerates HEVC encoding with minimal rate-distortion impact across both equirectangular and CMP-tiled content, yielding encoding-time reductions of roughly 33%-59% for ERP and about 51% on average for CMP, with Bjontegaard Delta Encoding Time (BDET) gains approaching -50% and wall-clock speedups of up to 4.2x.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17568v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ME-WARD: A multimodal ergonomic analysis tool for musculoskeletal risk assessment from inertial and video data in working plac</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17571</link><description>arXiv:2601.17571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents ME-WARD (Multimodal Ergonomic Workplace Assessment and Risk from Data), a novel system for ergonomic assessment and musculoskeletal risk evaluation that implements the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) method. ME-WARD is designed to process joint angle data from motion capture systems, including inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based setups, and deep learning human body pose tracking models. The tool's flexibility enables ergonomic risk assessment using any system capable of reliably measuring joint angles, extending the applicability of RULA beyond proprietary setups. To validate its performance, the tool was tested in an industrial setting during the assembly of conveyor belts, which involved high-risk tasks such as inserting rods and pushing conveyor belt components. The experiments leveraged gold standard IMU systems alongside a state-of-the-art monocular 3D pose estimation system. The results confirmed that ME-WARD produces reliable RULA scores that closely align with IMU-derived metrics for flexion-dominated movements and comparable performance with the monocular system, despite limitations in tracking lateral and rotational motions. This work highlights the potential of integrating multiple motion capture technologies into a unified and accessible ergonomic assessment pipeline. By supporting diverse input sources, including low-cost video-based systems, the proposed multimodal approach offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for ergonomic assessments, paving the way for broader adoption in resource-constrained industrial environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17571v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GenAI-Net: A Generative AI Framework for Automated Biomolecular Network Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17582</link><description>arXiv:2601.17582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular networks underpin emerging technologies in synthetic biology-from robust biomanufacturing and metabolic engineering to smart therapeutics and cell-based diagnostics-and also provide a mechanistic language for understanding complex dynamics in natural and ecological systems. Yet designing chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that implement a desired dynamical function remains largely manual: while a proposed network can be checked by simulation, the reverse problem of discovering a network from a behavioral specification is difficult, requiring substantial human insight to navigate a vast space of topologies and kinetic parameters with nonlinear and possibly stochastic dynamics. Here we introduce GenAI-Net, a generative AI framework that automates CRN design by coupling an agent that proposes reactions to simulation-based evaluation defined by a user-specified objective. GenAI-Net efficiently produces novel, topologically diverse solutions across multiple design tasks, including dose responses, complex logic gates, classifiers, oscillators, and robust perfect adaptation in deterministic and stochastic settings (including noise reduction). By turning specifications into families of circuit candidates and reusable motifs, GenAI-Net provides a general route to programmable biomolecular circuit design and accelerates the translation from desired function to implementable mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17582v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ToS: A Team of Specialists ensemble framework for Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection with distance estimation in Video</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17611</link><description>arXiv:2601.17611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection with distance estimation (3D SELD) in video involves identifying active sound events at each time frame while estimating their spatial coordinates. This multimodal task requires joint reasoning across semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions, a challenge that single models often struggle to address effectively. To tackle this, we introduce the Team of Specialists (ToS) ensemble framework, which integrates three complementary sub-networks: a spatio-linguistic model, a spatio-temporal model, and a tempo-linguistic model. Each sub-network specializes in a unique pair of dimensions, contributing distinct insights to the final prediction, akin to a collaborative team with diverse expertise. ToS has been benchmarked against state-of-the-art audio-visual models for 3D SELD on the DCASE2025 Task 3 Stereo SELD development set, consistently outperforming existing methods across key metrics. Future work will extend this proof of concept by strengthening the specialists with appropriate tasks, training, and pre-training curricula.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17611v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Higher-Order Gravitational Models: A Tutorial on Spherical Harmonics and the Newtonian Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17628</link><description>arXiv:2601.17628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational interactions is fundamental to the analysis, prediction, and control of space systems. While the Newtonian point-mass approximation suffices for many preliminary studies, real celestial bodies exhibit deviations from spherical symmetry, including oblateness, localized mass concentrations, and higher-order shape irregularities. These features can significantly perturb spacecraft trajectories, especially in low-altitude or long-duration missions, leading to cumulative orbit prediction errors and increased control demands. This article presents a tutorial introduction to spherical harmonic gravity models, outlining their theoretical foundations and underlying assumptions. Higher-order gravitational fields are derived as solutions to the Laplace equation, providing a systematic framework to capture the effects of non-uniform mass distributions. The impact of these higher-order terms on orbital dynamics is illustrated through examples involving Low Earth Orbit satellites and spacecraft near irregularly shaped asteroids, highlighting the practical significance of moving beyond the point-mass approximation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17628v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] End-to-End Joint ASR and Speaker Role Diarization with Child-Adult Interactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17640</link><description>arXiv:2601.17640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate transcription and speaker diarization of child-adult spoken interactions are crucial for developmental and clinical research. However, manual annotation is time-consuming and challenging to scale. Existing automated systems typically rely on cascaded speaker diarization and speech recognition pipelines, which can lead to error propagation. This paper presents a unified end-to-end framework that extends the Whisper encoder-decoder architecture to jointly model ASR and child-adult speaker role diarization. The proposed approach integrates: (i) a serialized output training scheme that emits speaker tags and start/end timestamps, (ii) a lightweight frame-level diarization head that enhances speaker-discriminative encoder representations, (iii) diarization-guided silence suppression for improved temporal precision, and (iv) a state-machine-based forced decoding procedure that guarantees structurally valid outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on two datasets demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over two cascaded baselines, achieving lower multi-talker word error rates and demonstrating competitive diarization accuracy across both Whisper-small and Whisper-large models. These findings highlight the effectiveness and practical utility of the proposed joint modeling framework for generating reliable, speaker-attributed transcripts of child-adult interactions at scale.

Abstract: Fluid simulations based on memory-efficient spatial representations like implicit neural spatial representations (INSRs) and Gaussian spatial representation (GSR), where the velocity fields are parameterized by neural networks or weighted Gaussian functions, has been an emerging research area. Though advantages over traditional discretizations like spatial adaptivity and continuous differentiability of these spatial representations are leveraged by fluid solvers, solving the time-dependent PDEs that governs the fluid dynamics remain challenging, especially in incompressible fluids where the divergence-free constraint is enforced. In this paper, we propose a grid-free solver Dynamic Divergence-Free Kernels (DDFKs) for incompressible flows based on divergence-free kernels (DFKs). Each DFK is incorporated with a matrix-valued radial basis function and a vector-valued weight, yielding a divergence-free vector field. We model the continuous flow velocity as the sum of multiple DFKs, thus enforcing incompressibility while being able to preserve different level of details. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method achieves comparable accuracy, robustness, ability to preserve vortices, time and memory efficiency and generality across diverse phenomena to state-of-the-art methods using memory-efficient spatial representations, while excels at maintaining incompressibility. Though our first-order solver are slower than fluid solvers with traditional discretizations, our approach exhibits significantly lower numerical dissipation due to reduced discretization error. We demonstrate our method on diverse incompressible flow examples with rich vortices and various solid boundary conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Over-The-Air Extreme Learning Machines with XL Reception via Nonlinear Cascaded Metasurfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17749</link><description>arXiv:2601.17749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently envisioned goal-oriented communications paradigm calls for the application of inference on wirelessly transferred data via Machine Learning (ML) tools. An emerging research direction deals with the realization of inference ML models directly in the physical layer of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, which, however, entails certain significant challenges. In this paper, leveraging the technology of programmable MetaSurfaces (MSs), we present an eXtremely Large (XL) MIMO system that acts as an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) performing binary classification tasks completely Over-The-Air (OTA), which can be trained in closed form. The proposed system comprises a receiver architecture consisting of densely parallel placed diffractive layers of XL MSs followed by a single reception radio-frequency chain. The front layer facing the MIMO channel consists of identical unit cells of a fixed NonLinear (NL) response, while the remaining layers of elements of tunable linear responses are utilized to approximate OTA the trained ELM weights. Our numerical investigations showcase that, in the XL regime of MS elements, the proposed XL-MIMO-ELM system achieves performance comparable to that of digital and idealized ML models across diverse datasets and wireless scenarios, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of embedding OTA learning capabilities into future communication systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Criteria Inverse Robustness in Radiotherapy Planning Using Semidefinite Programming</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17750</link><description>arXiv:2601.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiotherapy planning naturally leads to a multi-criteria optimization problem which is subject to different sources of uncertainty. In order to find the desired treatment plan, a decision maker must balance these objectives as well as the level of robustness towards uncertainty against each other. This paper showcases a quantitative approach to do so, which combines the theoretical model with the ability to deal with practical challenges. To this end, the uncertainty, which can be expressed via the so-called dose-influence matrix, is modelled using interval matrices. We use inverse robustness to introduce an additional objective, which aims to maximize the volume of the uncertainty set. A multi-criteria approach allows to handle the uncertainty while keeping appropriate values of the other objective functions. We solve the resulting quadratically constrained quadratic optimization problem (QCQP) by first relaxing it to a convex semidefinite problem (SDP) and then reconstructing optimal solutions of the QCQP from solutions of the SDP.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17750v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Capsule-Sized Multi-Wavelength Wireless Optical System for Edge-AI-Based Classification of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Flow Rate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17752</link><description>arXiv:2601.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-endoscopic gastrointestinal (GI) rebleeding frequently occurs within the first 72 hours after therapeutic hemostasis and remains a major cause of early morbidity and mortality. Existing non-invasive monitoring approaches primarily provide binary blood detection and lack quantitative assessment of bleeding severity or flow dynamic, limiting their ability to support timely clinical decision-making during this high-risk period. In this work, we developed a capsule-sized, multi-wavelength optical sensing wireless platform for order-of-magnitude-level classification of GI bleeding flow rate, leveraging transmission spectroscopy and low-power edge artificial intelligence. The system performs time-resolved, multi-spectral measurements and employs a lightweight two-dimensional convolutional neural network for on-device flow-rate classification, with physics-based validation confirming consistency with wavelength-dependent hemoglobin absorption behavior. In controlled in vitro experiments under simulated gastric conditions, the proposed approach achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98.75% across multiple bleeding flow-rate levels while robustly distinguishing diverse non-blood gastrointestinal interference. By performing embedded inference directly on the capsule electronics, the system reduced overall energy consumption by approximately 88% compared with continuous wireless transmission of raw data, making prolonged, battery-powered operation feasible. Extending capsule-based diagnostics beyond binary blood detection toward continuous, site-specific assessment of bleeding severity, this platform has the potential to support earlier identification of clinically significant rebleeding and inform timely re-intervention during post-endoscopic surveillance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17752v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MarketGANs: Multivariate financial time-series data augmentation using generative adversarial networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17773</link><description>arXiv:2601.17773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces MarketGAN, a factor-based generative framework for high-dimensional asset return generation under severe data scarcity. We embed an explicit asset-pricing factor structure as an economic inductive bias and generate returns as a single joint vector, thereby preserving cross-sectional dependence and tail co-movement alongside inter-temporal dynamics. MarketGAN employs generative adversarial learning with a temporal convolutional network (TCN) backbone, which models stochastic, time-varying factor loadings and volatilities and captures long-range temporal dependence. Using daily returns of large U.S. equities, we find that MarketGAN more closely matches empirical stylized facts of asset returns, including heavy-tailed marginal distributions, volatility clustering, leverage effects, and, most notably, high-dimensional cross-sectional correlation structures and tail co-movement across assets, than conventional factor-model-based bootstrap approaches. In portfolio applications, covariance estimates derived from MarketGAN-generated samples outperform those derived from other methods when factor information is at least weakly informative, demonstrating tangible economic value.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17773v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differentiable Integer Linear Programming is not Differentiable &amp; it's not a mere technical problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17800</link><description>arXiv:2601.17800v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the estimation of a parameter $f$ in PDEs using Bayesian procedures, and focus on posterior distributions constructed using Gaussian process priors, and its variational approximation. We establish contraction rates for the posterior distribution and the variational approximation in the regime of low-regularity parameters. The main novelty of the study lies in relaxing the condition that the ground truth parameter must lie in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian process prior, which is commonly imposed in existing studies on posterior contraction rate analysis [14,40,44]. The analysis relies on a delicate approximation argument that suitably balances various error sources. We illustrate the general theory on three nonlinear inverse problems for PDEs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17805v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An autonomous living database for perovskite photovoltaics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17807</link><description>arXiv:2601.17807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery is severely bottlenecked by the inability of manual curation to keep pace with exponential publication rates. This creates a widening knowledge gap. This is especially stark in photovoltaics, where the leading database for perovskite solar cells has been stagnant since 2021 despite massive ongoing research output. Here, we resolve this challenge by establishing an autonomous, self-updating living database (PERLA). Our pipeline integrates large language models with physics-aware validation to extract complex device data from the continuous literature stream, achieving human-level precision (&gt;90%) and eliminating annotator variance. By employing this system on the previously inaccessible post-2021 literature, we uncover critical evolutionary trends hidden by data lag: the field has decisively shifted toward inverted architectures employing self-assembled monolayers and formamidinium-rich compositions, driving a clear trajectory of sustained voltage loss reduction. PERLA transforms static publications into dynamic knowledge resources that enable data-driven discovery to operate at the speed of publication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17807v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Topological traps in evolutionary games</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17821</link><description>arXiv:2601.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How cooperation originates and persists among self-interested individuals is a central question in the social and behavioural sciences. In the canonical two-dimensional spatial Prisoner's Dilemma with unconditional imitation introduced by Nowak and May (1992), simulations on a Moore lattice show an abrupt drop in cooperation near the temptation $T\approx5/3$, yet even under these harsh conditions cooperative structures can still arise. However, the nucleation rates of these motifs, and their contribution along the full cooperation curve had not been quantified. Here we show, using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations combined with automatic cluster classification, that on the Moore lattice for $T\ge5/3$ residual cooperation is sustained exclusively by $3\times3$ (or larger) rectangular cooperator bricks, whereas on degree-8 random-regular graphs for $T\gtrsim1.5$ it is dominated by star-like motifs (1 hub + 8 leaves). Once the dynamics becomes nucleation limited, the macroscopic cooperation level is therefore governed by the statistics of a few exceptionally resilient shapes, rather than by many different cooperator motifs. Furthermore, we show that the lattice cooperation collapse near $T=5/3$ is kinetic rather than critical: the reduction in cooperation is not due to a loss of growth capacity of rectangular bricks, but to the progressive destabilisation of the subcritical motifs that dominate just below this threshold. Our results show that residual cooperation at high temptation is a rare-event nucleation phenomenon governed by a small set of topological traps, and highlight the value of motif-level analysis for explaining and engineering cooperation in spatial, social, and technological networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17821v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Speech Emotion Recognition with ASR Integration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17901</link><description>arXiv:2601.17901v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: The entanglement entropy (EE) of any bipartition of a pure state can be approximately expressed as a sum of entanglement links (ELs). In this work, we introduce their exact extension, i.e. the entanglement hyperlinks (EHLs), a type of generalized mutual informations defined through the inclusion-exclusion principle, each of which captures contributions to the multipartite entanglement that are not reducible to lower-order terms. We show that any EHL crossing a factorized partition must vanish, and that the EHLs between any set of blocks can be expressed as a sum of all the EHLs that join all of them. This last result allows us to provide an exact representation of the EE of any block of a pure state, from the sum of the EHLs which cross its boundary. In order to illustrate their rich structure, we discuss some explicit numerical examples using ground states of local Hamiltonians. The EHLs thus provide a remarkable tool to characterize multipartite entanglement in quantum information theory and quantum many-body physics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17926v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Elementary Quantum Gates from Lie Group Embeddings in $U(2^n)$: Geometry, Universality, and Discretization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17936</link><description>arXiv:2601.17936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard circuit model, elementary gates are specified relative to a chosen tensor factorization and are therefore extrinsic to the ambient group $U(2^n)$. Writing $N=2^n$, we introduce an intrinsic descriptor layer in $U(N)$ by declaring as primitive the motions inside faithful embedded copies of $SU(2)$, leading to the phase-free dictionary $\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\mathrm{elem}}(n)=\bigcup_{\phi\in\Emb(SU(2),U(N))}\phi(SU(2))$, and we also discuss the phase-inclusive $U(2)$ variant. We show that $\Emb(SU(2),U(N))$ decomposes into finitely many $U(N)$-homogeneous strata indexed by isotypic multiplicities, with stabilizers given by centralizers; the canonical two-level sector is organized by $\Gr_2(\C^N)$ up to a $PSU(2)$ gauge. Equipping $U(N)$ with the Hilbert--Schmidt bi-invariant metric, each embedded subgroup is totally geodesic. Using two-level QR/Givens factorization together with an explicit generation of diagonal tori by two-level phase rotations, we prove phase-free universality $\langle\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\mathrm{2lvl}}(n)\rangle=SU(N)$ and hence $\langle\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\mathrm{elem}}(n)\rangle=SU(N)$. Full universality in $U(N)$ follows by adjoining the abelian diagonal/global $U(1)$ factors (equivalently, by passing to the $U(2)$ two-level dictionary). Finally, we record a modular finite-alphabet interface by lifting Solovay--Kitaev approximation in $SU(2)$ through two-level embeddings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17936v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Boosting methods for interval-censored data with regression and classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17973</link><description>arXiv:2601.17973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boosting has garnered significant interest across both machine learning and statistical communities. Traditional boosting algorithms, designed for fully observed random samples, often struggle with real-world problems, particularly with interval-censored data. This type of data is common in survival analysis and time-to-event studies where exact event times are unobserved but fall within known intervals. Effective handling of such data is crucial in fields like medical research, reliability engineering, and social sciences. In this work, we introduce novel nonparametric boosting methods for regression and classification tasks with interval-censored data. Our approaches leverage censoring unbiased transformations to adjust loss functions and impute transformed responses while maintaining model accuracy. Implemented via functional gradient descent, these methods ensure scalability and adaptability. We rigorously establish their theoretical properties, including optimality and mean squared error trade-offs. Our proposed methods not only offer a robust framework for enhancing predictive accuracy in domains where interval-censored data are common but also complement existing work, expanding the applicability of existing boosting techniques. Empirical studies demonstrate robust performance across various finite-sample scenarios, highlighting the practical utility of our approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17973v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Cherry-Picking Approach to Large Load Shaping for More Effective Carbon Reduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17990</link><description>arXiv:2601.17990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shaping multi-megawatt loads, such as data centers, impacts generator dispatch on the electric grid, which in turn affects system CO2 emissions and energy cost. Substantiating the effectiveness of prevalent load shaping strategies, such as those based on grid-level average carbon intensity, locational marginal price, or marginal emissions, is challenging due to the lack of detailed counterfactual data required for accurate attribution. This study uses a series of calibrated granular ERCOT day-ahead direct current optimal power flow (DC-OPF) simulations for counterfactual analysis of a broad set of load shaping strategies on grid CO2 emissions and cost of electricity. In terms of annual grid level CO2 emissions reductions, LMP-based shaping outperforms other common strategies, but can be significantly improved upon. Examining the performance of practicable strategies under different grid conditions motivates a more effective load shaping approach: one that "cherry-picks" a daily strategy based on observable grid signals and historical data. The cherry-picking approach to power load shaping is applicable to any large flexible consumer on the electricity grid, such as data centers, distributed energy resources and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17990v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Flow-based Extremal Mathematical Structure Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18005</link><description>arXiv:2601.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of extremal structures in mathematics requires navigating vast and nonconvex landscapes where analytical methods offer little guidance and brute-force search becomes intractable. We introduce FlowBoost, a closed-loop generative framework that learns to discover rare and extremal geometric structures by combining three components: (i) a geometry-aware conditional flow-matching model that learns to sample high-quality configurations, (ii) reward-guided policy optimization with action exploration that directly optimizes the generation process toward the objective while maintaining diversity, and (iii) stochastic local search for both training-data generation and final refinement. Unlike prior open-loop approaches, such as PatternBoost that retrains on filtered discrete samples, or AlphaEvolve which relies on frozen Large Language Models (LLMs) as evolutionary mutation operators, FlowBoost enforces geometric feasibility during sampling, and propagates reward signal directly into the generative model, closing the optimization loop and requiring much smaller training sets and shorter training times, and reducing the required outer-loop iterations by orders of magnitude, while eliminating dependence on LLMs. We demonstrate the framework on four geometric optimization problems: sphere packing in hypercubes, circle packing maximizing sum of radii, the Heilbronn triangle problem, and star discrepancy minimization. In several cases, FlowBoost discovers configurations that match or exceed the best known results. For circle packings, we improve the best known lower bounds, surpassing the LLM-based system AlphaEvolve while using substantially fewer computational resources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18005v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AmbER$^2$: Dual Ambiguity-Aware Emotion Recognition Applied to Speech and Text</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18010</link><description>arXiv:2601.18010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition is inherently ambiguous, with uncertainty arising both from rater disagreement and from discrepancies across modalities such as speech and text. There is growing interest in modeling rater ambiguity using label distributions. However, modality ambiguity remains underexplored, and multimodal approaches often rely on simple feature fusion without explicitly addressing conflicts between modalities. In this work, we propose AmbER$^2$, a dual ambiguity-aware framework that simultaneously models rater-level and modality-level ambiguity through a teacher-student architecture with a distribution-wise training objective. Evaluations on IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show that AmbER$^2$ consistently improves distributional fidelity over conventional cross-entropy baselines and achieves performance competitive with, or superior to, recent state-of-the-art systems. For example, on IEMOCAP, AmbER$^2$ achieves relative improvements of 20.3% on Bhattacharyya coefficient (0.83 vs. 0.69), 13.6% on R$^2$ (0.67 vs. 0.59), 3.8% on accuracy (0.683 vs. 0.658), and 4.5% on F1 (0.675 vs. 0.646). Further analysis across ambiguity levels shows that explicitly modeling ambiguity is particularly beneficial for highly uncertain samples. These findings highlight the importance of jointly addressing rater and modality ambiguity when building robust emotion recognition systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural-Inspired Multi-Agent Molecular Communication Networks for Collective Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18018</link><description>arXiv:2601.18018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) is a pivotal enabler for the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). However, current research often relies on super-capable individual agents with complex transceiver architectures that defy the energy and processing constraints of realistic nanomachines. This paper proposes a paradigm shift towards collective intelligence, inspired by the cortical networks of the biological brain. We introduce a decentralized network architecture where simple nanomachines interact via a diffusive medium using a threshold-based firing mechanism modeled by Greenberg-Hastings (GH) cellular automata. We derive fixed-point equations for steady-state populations via mean-field analysis and validate them against stochastic simulations. We demonstrate that the network undergoes a second-order phase transition at a specific activation threshold. Crucially, we show that both pairwise and collective mutual information peak exactly at this critical transition point, confirming that the system maximizes information propagation and processing capacity at the edge of chaos.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MlPET: A Localized Neural Network Approach for Probabilistic Post-Reconstruction PET Image Analysis Using Informed Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18021</link><description>arXiv:2601.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and evaluate MlPET, a fast localized machine learning approach for probabilistic PET image analysis addressing the noise-resolution trade-off in conventional reconstructions. MlPET replaces computationally demanding Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling with a localized neural network trained to estimate posterior mean voxel activity from small image neighborhoods. The method incorporates scanner-specific point spread functions, spatially correlated noise modeling, and flexible priors. Performance was evaluated on NEMA IEC phantom data from three PET systems (GE Discovery MI, Siemens Biograph Vision 600, and Quadra) under varying reconstruction settings and acquisition times. On phantom data, MlPET achieved contrast recovery coefficients consistently higher than standard PET and close to 1.0 (including 10 mm spheres), while reducing background noise and improving spatial definition. Effective pointspread function full width at half maximum decreased from approximately 2 mm in standard PET to below 1 mm with MlPET, a 2.5 fold reduction in blur. Comparable image quality was obtained at 40-80 s acquisition time with MlPET versus 900 s with conventional PET. MlPET provides an efficient approach for quantitative probabilistic post-reconstruction PET analysis. By combining informed priors with neural network speed, it achieves noise suppression and resolution enhancement without altering reconstruction algorithms. The method shows promise for improved small-lesion detectability and quantitative reliability in clinical PET imaging. Future studies will evaluate performance on patient data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18021v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SpatialEmb: Extract and Encode Spatial Information for 1-Stage Multi-channel Multi-speaker ASR on Arbitrary Microphone Arrays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18037</link><description>arXiv:2601.18037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial information is a critical clue for multi-channel multi-speaker target speech recognition. Most state-of-the-art multi-channel Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems extract spatial features only during the speech separation stage, followed by standard single-channel ASR on the separated speech. This approach results in an inefficient, lengthy pipeline and sub-optimal ASR performance due to the accumulated errors from preprocessing modules. Furthermore, most spatial feature extraction methods depend on the knowledge of speaker positions and microphone topology, making the systems reliant on specific settings and challenging to adapt to new equipment. In this work, we propose a solution to these issues with a lightweight embedding module named SpatialEmb, which extracts and encodes spatial information directly for the ASR model, supporting both fixed and arbitrary microphone topology. We conduct comprehensive experiments on AliMeeting, a real meeting corpus, to determine the optimal model design for SpatialEmb in terms of both performance and efficiency. Our best model trained with 105 hours Train-Ali-far achieves 17.04% and 20.32% character error rates (CER) on the Eval and Test sets, establishing a new state-of-the-art result with the same training data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Laser interferometry as a robust neuromorphic platform for machine learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18047</link><description>arXiv:2601.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for implementing an optical neural network using only linear optical resources, namely field displacement and interferometry applied to coherent states of light. The nonlinearity required for learning in a neural network is realized via an encoding of the input into phase shifts allowing for far more straightforward experimental implementation compared to previous proposals for, and demonstrations of, $\textit{in situ}$ inference. Beyond $\textit{in situ}$ inference, the method enables $\textit{in situ}$ training by utilizing established techniques like parameter shift rules or physical backpropagation to extract gradients directly from measurements of the linear optical circuit. We also investigate the effect of photon losses and find the model to be very resilient to these.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Di-Graphs with tightly connected Clusters: Effective Graph Laplacians and Resolvent Convergence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18057</link><description>arXiv:2601.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study Laplacians on graphs for which connectivity within certain sub-graphs tends to infinity. Our main focus are graphs sharing a common node set on which edge weights within certain clusters grow to infinity. As intra-cluster connectivity increases, we show that the corresponding graph Laplacians converge -- in the resolvent sense -- to an effective graph Laplacian. This effective limit Laplacian is defined on a coarsened graph, where each highly connected cluster is collapsed into a single node. In the undirected setting, the effective Laplacian arises naturally from agregating over tightly connected clusters. In the directed case, the limiting graph structure depends on the precise manner in which connectivity increases; with the corresponding effects mediated by the left and right kernel structure of the Laplacian restricted to high-connectivity clusters. Our results shed light on the emergence of coarse-grained dynamics in large-scale networks and contribute to spectral graph theory of directed graphs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18057v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differentiable Architecture Search for Adversarially Robust Quantum Computer Vision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18058</link><description>arXiv:2601.18058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current quantum neural networks suffer from extreme sensitivity to both adversarial perturbations and hardware noise, creating a significant barrier to real-world deployment. Existing robustness techniques typically sacrifice clean accuracy or require prohibitive computational resources. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (DQAS) framework that addresses these limitations by jointly optimizing circuit structure and robustness through gradient-based methods. Our approach enhances traditional DQAS with a lightweight Classical Noise Layer applied before quantum processing, enabling simultaneous optimization of gate selection and noise parameters. This design preserves the quantum circuit's integrity while introducing trainable perturbations that enhance robustness without compromising standard performance. Experimental validation on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR datasets shows consistent improvements in both clean and adversarial accuracy compared to existing quantum architecture search methods. Under various attack scenarios, including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and Momentum Iterative Method (MIM), and under realistic quantum noise conditions, our hybrid framework maintains superior performance. Testing on actual quantum hardware confirms the practical viability of discovered architectures. These results demonstrate that strategic classical preprocessing combined with differentiable quantum architecture optimization can significantly enhance quantum neural network robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18058v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Overcoming Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Circuits using a Two-Step Least Squares Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18060</link><description>arXiv:2601.18060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms are a vital part of quantum computing. It is a blend of quantum and classical methods for tackling tough problems in machine learning, chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. Yet as these algorithms scale up, they cannot escape the barren-plateau phenomenon. As systems grow, gradients can vanish so quickly that training deep or randomly initialized circuits becomes nearly impossible. To overcome the barren plateau problem, we introduce a two-stage optimization framework. First comes the convex initialization stage. Here, we shape the quantum energy landscape, the Hilmaton landscape, into a smooth, low-energy basin. This step makes gradients easier to spot and keeps noise from derailing the process. Once we have gotten a stable gradient flow, we move to the second stage: nonconvex refinement. In this phase, we allow the algorithm to explore different energy minima, thereby making the model more expressive. Finally, we used our two-stage solution to perform quantum cryptanalysis of the quantum key distribution protocol (i.e., BB84) to determine the optimal cloning strategies. The simulation results showed that our proposed two-stage solution outperforms its random initialization counterpart.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18060v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Remarks about Connection and Dirac matrices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18071</link><description>arXiv:2601.18071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection Laplacian L and the Dirac matrix D are both n x n matrices defined from a given finite simplicial complex G with n sets. In both cases, there is interlacing of the eigenvalues for subcomplexes. This gives general upper bounds of the eigenvalues both for L and D in terms of inclusion or intersection degrees. We conjecture that L always dominates both D and the inverse of L in a weak Loewner sense. In a second part we look at dynamical systems (G,T), where T is a simplicial map on G. Both L and D generalize to dynamical versions of L and D. The modified L is still unimodular with an explicit Green function inverse and modified Dirac part still comes from an exterior derivative d. We also review the Lefschetz fixed point theorem for a simplicial map T on a simplicial complex G which implies the Brouwer fixed point theorem: any simplicial map on a contractible finite abstract simplicial complex G has a fixed simplex.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18071v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Use of operator defect identities in multi-channel signal plus residual-analysis via iterated products and telescoping energy-residuals: Applications to kernels in machine learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18080</link><description>arXiv:2601.18080v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Recent progress of voice conversion~(VC) has achieved a new milestone in speaker cloning and linguistic preservation. But the field remains fragmented, relying on specialized models for linguistic-preserving, expressive, and singing scenarios. We propose OneVoice, a unified zero-shot framework capable of handling all three scenarios within a single model. OneVoice is built upon a continuous language model trained with VAE-free next-patch diffusion, ensuring high fidelity and efficient sequence modeling. Its core design for unification lies in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designed to explicitly model shared conversion knowledge and scenario-specific expressivity. Expert selection is coordinated by a dual-path routing mechanism, including shared expert isolation and scenario-aware domain expert assignment with global-local cues. For precise conditioning, scenario-specific prosodic features are fused into each layer via a gated mechanism, allowing adaptive usage of prosody information. Furthermore, to enable the core idea and alleviate the imbalanced issue (abundant speech vs. scarce singing), we adopt a two-stage progressive training that includes foundational pre-training and scenario enhancement with LoRA-based domain experts. Experiments show that OneVoice matches or surpasses specialized models across all three scenarios, while verifying flexible control over scenarios and offering a fast decoding version as few as 2 steps. Code and model will be released soon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18094v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exact Minimum-Volume Confidence Set Intersection for Multinomial Outcomes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18145</link><description>arXiv:2601.18145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computation of confidence sets is central to data science and machine learning, serving as the workhorse of A/B testing and underpinning the operation and analysis of reinforcement learning algorithms. Among all valid confidence sets for the multinomial parameter, minimum-volume confidence sets (MVCs) are optimal in that they minimize average volume, but they are defined as level sets of an exact p-value that is discontinuous and difficult to compute. Rather than attempting to characterize the geometry of MVCs directly, this paper studies a practically motivated decision problem: given two observed multinomial outcomes, can one certify whether their MVCs intersect? We present a certified, tolerance-aware algorithm for this intersection problem. The method exploits the fact that likelihood ordering induces halfspace constraints in log-odds coordinates, enabling adaptive geometric partitioning of parameter space and computable lower and upper bounds on p-values over each cell. For three categories, this yields an efficient and provably sound algorithm that either certifies intersection, certifies disjointness, or returns an indeterminate result when the decision lies within a prescribed margin. We further show how the approach extends to higher dimensions. The results demonstrate that, despite their irregular geometry, MVCs admit reliable certified decision procedures for core tasks in A/B testing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18145v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated HER2 scoring with uncertainty quantification using lensfree holography and deep learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18219</link><description>arXiv:2601.18219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression is critical for breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy selection; yet, most existing digital HER2 scoring methods rely on bulky and expensive optical systems. Here, we present a compact and cost-effective lensfree holography platform integrated with deep learning for automated HER2 scoring of immunohistochemically stained breast tissue sections. The system captures lensfree diffraction patterns of stained HER2 tissue sections under RGB laser illumination and acquires complex field information over a sample area of ~1,250 mm^2 at an effective throughput of ~84 mm^2 per minute. To enhance diagnostic reliability, we incorporated an uncertainty quantification strategy based on Bayesian Monte Carlo dropout, which provides autonomous uncertainty estimates for each prediction and supports reliable, robust HER2 scoring, with an overall correction rate of 30.4%. Using a blinded test set of 412 unique tissue samples, our approach achieved a testing accuracy of 84.9% for 4-class (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) HER2 classification and 94.8% for binary (0/1+ vs. 2+/3+) HER2 scoring with uncertainty quantification. Overall, this lensfree holography approach provides a practical pathway toward portable, high-throughput, and cost-effective HER2 scoring, particularly suited for resource-limited settings, where traditional digital pathology infrastructure is unavailable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Rehearsal for Continual Learning in ASR via Singular Value Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18266</link><description>arXiv:2601.18266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) suffers from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new tasks, domains, or speakers. A common strategy to mitigate this is to store a subset of past data in memory for rehearsal. However, rehearsal-based methods face key limitations: storing data is often costly, infeasible with pre-trained models, or restricted by privacy regulations. Running existing rehearsal-based methods with smaller memory sizes to alleviate these issues usually leads to degraded performance.
  We propose a rehearsal-based CL method that remains effective even with minimal memory. It operates in two stages: first, fine-tuning on the new task; second, applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the changes in linear layers and, in a parameter-efficient manner, retraining only gating vectors on the singular values, which control to extent to which updates from the first stage are accepted, using rehearsal. We extensively test and analyze our method on two monolingual and two multilingual benchmarks. Our method reduces forgetting and outperforms state-of-the-art CL approaches for ASR, even when limited to a single utterance per previous task.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Scalable Normalizing Flows for the Hubbard Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18273</link><description>arXiv:2601.18273v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide, with coronary artery disease (CAD) comprising the largest subcategory of CVDs. Recently, there has been increased focus on detecting CAD using phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, with high success in clinical environments with low noise and optimal sensor placement. Multichannel techniques have been found to be more robust to noise; however, achieving robust performance on real-world data remains a challenge. This work utilises a novel multichannel energy-based noisy-segment rejection algorithm, using heart and noise-reference microphones, to discard audio segments with large amounts of nonstationary noise before training a deep learning classifier. This conformer-based classifier takes mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from multiple channels, further helping improve the model's noise robustness. The proposed method achieved 78.4% accuracy and 78.2% balanced accuracy on 297 subjects, representing improvements of 4.1% and 4.3%, respectively, compared to training without noisy-segment rejection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Residual Learning for Neural Ambisonics Encoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18322</link><description>arXiv:2601.18322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging wearable devices such as smartglasses and extended reality headsets demand high-quality spatial audio capture from compact, head-worn microphone arrays. Ambisonics provides a device-agnostic spatial audio representation by mapping array signals to spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. In practice, however, accurate encoding remains challenging. While traditional linear encoders are signal-independent and robust, they amplify low-frequency noise and suffer from high-frequency spatial aliasing. On the other hand, neural network approaches can outperform linear encoders but they often assume idealized microphones and may perform inconsistently in real-world scenarios. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce a residual-learning framework that refines a linear encoder with corrections from a neural network. Using measured array transfer functions from smartglasses, we compare a UNet-based encoder from the literature with a new recurrent attention model. Our analysis reveals that both neural encoders only consistently outperform the linear baseline when integrated within the residual learning framework. In the residual configuration, both neural models achieve consistent and significant improvements across all tested metrics for in-domain data and moderate gains for out-of-domain data. Yet, coherence analysis indicates that all neural encoder configurations continue to struggle with directionally accurate high-frequency encoding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18322v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Adaptive Purification Controller for Quantum Networks: Dynamic Protocol Selection and Multipartite Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18351</link><description>arXiv:2601.18351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient entanglement distribution is the cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that autonomously optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the "goodput," the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocol families (e.g., BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results demonstrate that our approach eliminates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and prevents resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, demonstrating robustness for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, confirming real-time feasibility with decision latencies in the millisecond range per link.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18351v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Noise-Robust AV-ASR Using Visual Features Both in the Whisper Encoder and Decoder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18396</link><description>arXiv:2601.18396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In audiovisual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) systems, information fusion of visual features in a pre-trained ASR has been proven as a promising method to improve noise robustness. In this work, based on the prominent Whisper ASR, first, we propose a simple and effective visual fusion method -- use of visual features both in encoder and decoder (dual-use) -- to learn the audiovisual interactions in the encoder and to weigh modalities in the decoder. Second, we compare visual fusion methods in Whisper models of various sizes. Our proposed dual-use method shows consistent noise robustness improvement, e.g., a 35% relative improvement (WER: 4.41% vs. 6.83%) based on Whisper small, and a 57% relative improvement (WER: 4.07% vs. 9.53%) based on Whisper medium, compared to typical reference middle fusion in babble noise with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0dB. Third, we conduct ablation studies examining the impact of various module designs and fusion options. Fine-tuned on 1929 hours of audiovisual data, our dual-use method using Whisper medium achieves 4.08% (MUSAN babble noise) and 4.43% (NoiseX babble noise) average WER across various SNRs, thereby establishing a new state-of-the-art in noisy conditions on the LRS3 AV-ASR benchmark.

Abstract: Emergent cooperation in classical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning has gained significant attention, particularly in the context of Sequential Social Dilemmas (SSDs). While classical reinforcement learning approaches have demonstrated capability for emergent cooperation, research on extending these methods to Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning remains limited, particularly through communication. In this paper, we apply communication approaches to quantum Q-Learning agents: the Mutual Acknowledgment Token Exchange (MATE) protocol, its extension Mutually Endorsed Distributed Incentive Acknowledgment Token Exchange (MEDIATE), the peer rewarding mechanism Gifting, and Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL). We evaluate these approaches in three SSDs: the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Iterated Stag Hunt, and Iterated Game of Chicken. Our experimental results show that approaches using MATE with temporal-difference measure (MATE\textsubscript{TD}), AutoMATE, MEDIATE-I, and MEDIATE-S achieved high cooperation levels across all dilemmas, demonstrating that communication is a viable mechanism for fostering emergent cooperation in Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18419v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Theory of Single-Antenna Atomic Beamforming</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18426</link><description>arXiv:2601.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the quantum advantages of highly excited atoms, Rydberg atomic receivers (RAREs) represent a paradigm shift in radio wave detection, offering high sensitivity and broadband reception. However, existing studies largely model RAREs as isotropic point receivers and overlook the spatial variations of atomic quantum states within vapor cells, thus inaccurately characterizing their reception patterns. To address this issue, we present a theoretical analysis of the aforementioned spatial responses of a standard local-oscillator (LO)- dressed RARE. Our results reveal that increasing the vapor-cell length produces a receive beam aligned with the LO field, with a beamwidth inversely proportional to the cell length. This finding enables atomic beamforming to enhance received signal-to-noise ratio using only a single-antenna RARE. Furthermore, we derive the achievable beamforming gain by characterizing and balancing the fundamental tradeoff between the effects of increasing the vapor cell length and the exponential power decay of laser propagating through the cell. To overcome the limitation imposed by exponential decay, we propose a novel RARE architecture termed segmental vapor cell. This architecture consists of vapor-cell segments separated by clear-air gaps, allowing the total cell length (and hence propagation loss) to remain fixed while the effective cell length increases. As a result, this segmented design expands the effective atom-field interaction area without increasing the total vapor cell length, yielding a narrower beamwidth and thus higher beamforming gain as compared with a traditional continuous vapor cell.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18426v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Audio Inpainting in Time-Frequency Domain with Phase-Aware Prior</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18535</link><description>arXiv:2601.18535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called audio inpainting problem in the time domain refers to estimating missing segments of samples within a signal. Over the years, several methods have been developed for such type of audio inpainting. In contrast to this case, a time-frequency variant of inpainting appeared in the literature, where the challenge is to reconstruct missing spectrogram columns with reliable information. We propose a method to address this time-frequency audio inpainting problem. Our approach is based on the recently introduced phase-aware signal prior that exploits an estimate of the instantaneous frequency. An optimization problem is formulated and solved using the generalized Chambolle-Pock algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated both objectively and subjectively against other time-frequency inpainting methods, specifically a deep-prior neural network and the autoregression-based approach known as Janssen-TF. Our proposed approach surpassed these methods in the objective evaluation as well as in the conducted listening test. Moreover, this outcome is achieved with a substantially reduced computational requirement compared to alternative methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Cost of Inflation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18544</link><description>arXiv:2601.18544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical evidence suggests that there is little to no correlation between the rate of inflation and the size of price change. Economists have hitherto taken this to mean that monetary shocks do not generate much deviation in relative prices and therefore inflation does not hurt the economy by impeding the workings of the price system. This paper presents a production network model of inflationary dynamics in which it is well possible for inflation to have near-zero correlation with the size of price change yet cause significant distortion of relative prices. The relative price distortion caused by inflation critically depends on the spectral gap, degree distribution, and assortativity of the production network.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Global Optimization of Atomic Clusters via Physically-Constrained Tensor Train Decomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18592</link><description>arXiv:2601.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global optimization of atomic clusters represents a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry and materials science due to the exponential growth of local minima with system size (i.e., the curse of dimensionality). We introduce a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the low-rank structure of potential energy surfaces through Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. Our approach combines two complementary TT-based strategies: the algebraic TTOpt method, which utilizes maximum volume sampling, and the probabilistic PROTES method, which employs generative sampling. A key innovation is the development of physically-constrained encoding schemes that incorporate molecular constraints directly into the discretization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by identifying global minima of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 45 atoms. Furthermore, we establish its practical applicability to real-world systems by optimizing 20-atom carbon clusters using a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential, achieving geometries consistent with quantum-accurate simulations. This work establishes TT-decomposition as a powerful tool for molecular structure prediction and provides a general framework adaptable to a wide range of high-dimensional optimization problems in computational material science.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18592v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distinguishing Graphs by Counting Homomorphisms from Sparse Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18602</link><description>arXiv:2601.18602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lov\'asz (1967) showed that two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if, and only if, they are homomorphism indistinguishable over all graphs, i.e., $G$ and $H$ admit the same number of number of homomorphisms from every graph $F$. Subsequently, a substantial line of work studied homomorphism indistinguishability over restricted graph classes. For example, homomorphism indistinguishability over minor-closed graph classes $\mathcal{F}$ such as the class of planar graphs, the class of graphs of treewidth $\leq k$, pathwidth $\leq k$, or treedepth $\leq k$, was shown to be equivalent to quantum isomorphism and equivalences with respect to counting logic fragments, respectively.
  Via such characterisations, the distinguishing power of e.g. logical or quantum graph isomorphism relaxations can be studied with graph-theoretic means. In this vein, Roberson (2022) conjectured that homomorphism indistinguishability over every graph class excluding some minor is not the same as isomorphism. We prove this conjecture for all vortex-free graph classes. In particular, homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of bounded Euler genus is not the same as isomorphism. As a negative result, we show that Roberson's conjecture fails when generalised to graph classes excluding a topological minor.
  Furthermore, we show homomorphism distinguishing closedness for several graph classes including all topological-minor-closed and union-closed classes of forests, and show that homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of genus $\leq g$ (and other parameters) forms a strict hierarchy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18602v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Universality of Many-body Projected Ensemble for Learning Quantum Data Distribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18637</link><description>arXiv:2601.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating quantum data by learning the underlying quantum distribution poses challenges in both theoretical and practical scenarios, yet it is a critical task for understanding quantum systems. A fundamental question in quantum machine learning (QML) is the universality of approximation: whether a parameterized QML model can approximate any quantum distribution. We address this question by proving a universality theorem for the Many-body Projected Ensemble (MPE) framework, a method for quantum state design that uses a single many-body wave function to prepare random states. This demonstrates that MPE can approximate any distribution of pure states within a 1-Wasserstein distance error. This theorem provides a rigorous guarantee of universal expressivity, addressing key theoretical gaps in QML. For practicality, we propose an Incremental MPE variant with layer-wise training to improve the trainability. Numerical experiments on clustered quantum states and quantum chemistry datasets validate MPE's efficacy in learning complex quantum data distributions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18637v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synchronization and Localization in Ad-Hoc ICAS Networks Using a Two-Stage Kuramoto Method</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18643</link><description>arXiv:2601.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enable Integrated Communications and Sensing (ICAS) in a peer-to-peer vehicular network, precise synchronization in frequency and phase among the communicating entities is required.

In this work, we propose a joint, distributed synchronization and localization scheme for a network of communicating entities. Our proposed scheme is mostly signal-agnostic and therefore can be applied to a wide range of possible ICAS signals. We also mitigate the effect of finite sampling frequencies, which otherwise would degrade the synchronization and localization performance severely.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18643v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unique Inverse Decomposition of Positive Definite Matrices under Linear Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18662</link><description>arXiv:2601.18662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear decomposition of a positive definite matrix into two components: the inverse of another positive definite matrix and a symmetric matrix constrained to lie in a prescribed linear subspace. Equivalently, the inverse component is required to belong to the orthogonal complement of that subspace with respect to the trace inner product. Under a sharp nondegeneracy condition on the subspace, we show that every positive definite matrix admits a \emph{unique} decomposition of this form.
  This decomposition admits a variational characterization as the unique minimizer of a strictly convex log-determinant optimization problem, which in turn yields a natural dual formulation that can be efficiently exploited computationally. We derive several properties, including the stability of the decomposition.
  We further develop feasibility-preserving Newton-type algorithms with provable convergence guarantees and analyze their per-iteration complexity in terms of algebraic properties of the decomposed matrix and the underlying subspace. Finally, we show that the proposed decomposition arises naturally in exponential utility maximization, a central problem in mathematical finance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18662v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uniform Computability of PAC Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18663</link><description>arXiv:2601.18663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study uniform computability properties of PAC learning using Weihrauch complexity. We focus on closed concept classes, which are either represented by positive, by negative or by full information. Among other results, we prove that proper PAC learning from positive information is equivalent to the limit operation on Baire space, whereas improper PAC learning from positive information is closely related to Weak K\H{o}nig's Lemma and even equivalent to it, when we have some negative information about the admissible hypotheses. If arbitrary hypotheses are allowed, then improper PAC learning from positive information is still in a finitary DNC range, which implies that it is non-deterministically computable, but does not allow for probabilistic algorithms. These results can also be seen as a classification of the degree of constructivity of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning. All the aforementioned results hold if an upper bound of the VC dimension is provided as an additional input information. We also study the question of how these results are affected if the VC dimension is not given, but only promised to be finite or if concept classes are represented by negative or full information. Finally, we also classify the complexity of the VC dimension operation itself, which is a problem that is of independent interest. For positive or full information it turns out to be equivalent to the binary sorting problem, for negative information it is equivalent to the jump of sorting. This classification allows also conclusions regarding the Borel complexity of PAC learnability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18663v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Out-of-Distribution Radar Detection with Complex VAEs: Theory, Whitening, and ANMF Fusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18677</link><description>arXiv:2601.18677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the detection of weak complex-valued signals immersed in non-Gaussian, range-varying interference, with emphasis on maritime radar scenarios. The proposed methodology exploits a Complex-valued Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) trained exclusively on clutter-plus-noise to perform Out-Of-Distribution detection. By operating directly on in-phase / quadrature samples, the CVAE preserves phase and Doppler structure and is assessed in two configurations: (i) using unprocessed range profiles and (ii) after local whitening, where per-range covariance estimates are obtained from neighboring profiles. Using extensive simulations together with real sea-clutter data from the CSIR maritime dataset, we benchmark performance against classical and adaptive detectors (MF, NMF, AMF-SCM, ANMF-SCM, ANMF-Tyler). In both configurations, the CVAE yields a higher detection probability Pd at matched false-alarm rate Pfa, with the most notable improvements observed under whitening. We further integrate the CVAE with the ANMF through a weighted log-p fusion rule at the decision level, attaining enhanced robustness in strongly non-Gaussian clutter and enabling empirically calibrated Pfa control under H0. Overall, the results demonstrate that statistical normalization combined with complex-valued generative modeling substantively improves detection in realistic sea-clutter conditions, and that the fused CVAE-ANMF scheme constitutes a competitive alternative to established model-based detectors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18677v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learned harmonic mean estimation of the marginal likelihood for multimodal posteriors with flow matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18683</link><description>arXiv:2601.18683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The marginal likelihood, or Bayesian evidence, is a crucial quantity for Bayesian model comparison but its computation can be challenging for complex models, even in parameters space of moderate dimension. The learned harmonic mean estimator has been shown to provide accurate and robust estimates of the marginal likelihood simply using posterior samples. It is agnostic to the sampling strategy, meaning that the samples can be obtained using any method. This enables marginal likelihood calculation and model comparison with whatever sampling is most suitable for the task. However, the internal density estimators considered previously for the learned harmonic mean can struggle with highly multimodal posteriors. In this work we introduce flow matching-based continuous normalizing flows as a powerful architecture for the internal density estimation of the learned harmonic mean. We demonstrate the ability to handle challenging multimodal posteriors, including an example in 20 parameter dimensions, showcasing the method's ability to handle complex posteriors without the need for fine-tuning or heuristic modifications to the base distribution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18683v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLAMA LIMA: A Living Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Generative AI on Learning Mathematics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18685</link><description>arXiv:2601.18685v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Traffic Steering (TS) dynamically allocates user traffic across cells to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE), load balance, and spectrum efficiency in 5G networks. However, TS algorithms remain vulnerable to adversarial conditions such as interference spikes, handover storms, and localized outages. To address this, an AI-driven fuzz testing framework based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to systematically expose hidden vulnerabilities. Using NVIDIA Sionna, five TS algorithms are evaluated across six scenarios. Results show that AI-driven fuzzing detects 34.3% more total vulnerabilities and 5.8% more critical failures than traditional testing, achieving superior diversity and edge-case discovery. The observed variance in critical failure detection underscores the stochastic nature of rare vulnerabilities. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven fuzzing offers an effective and scalable validation approach for improving TS algorithm robustness and ensuring resilient 6G-ready networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18690v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-Driven Qubit Characterization and Optimal Control using Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18704</link><description>arXiv:2601.18704v1 Announce Type: cross

By training a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict qubit behavior, our approach enables efficient gradient-based pulse optimization without the need for a detailed system model. First, we sample qubit dynamics using random control pulses with weak prior assumptions. We then train the RNN on the system's observed responses, and use the trained model to optimize high-fidelity control pulses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through simulations on a single $ST_0$ qubit.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18704v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Point transformer for protein structural heterogeneity analysis using CryoEM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18713</link><description>arXiv:2601.18713v1 Announce Type: cross

For protein systems with multiple degrees of freedom, it is still challenging to disentangle and interpret the different modes of dynamics.

Abstract: Subtraction games are a classical topic in Combinatorial Game Theory. A result of Golomb~(1966) shows that every subtraction game with a finite move set has an eventually periodic nim-sequence, but the known proof yields only an exponential upper bound on the period length. Flammenkamp (1997) conjectures a striking classification for three-move subtraction games: non-additive rulesets exhibit linear period lengths of the form ``the sum of two moves'', where the choice of which two moves displays fractal-like behavior, while additive sets $S=\{a,b,a+b\}$ have purely periodic outcomes with linear or quadratic period lengths. Despite early attention in \emph{Winning Ways} (1982), the general additive case remains open. We introduce and analyze a dual winning convention, which we call {\sc sink subtraction}. Unlike the standard wall convention, where moves to negative positions are forbidden, the sink convention declares a player the winner upon moving to a non-positive position. We show that {\sc additive sink subtraction} admits a complete solution: the nim-sequence is purely periodic with an explicit linear or quadratic period formula, and we conjecture a duality between additive sink subtraction and classical wall subtraction.

Abstract: Machine learning systems embed preferences either in training losses or through post-processing of calibrated predictions. Applying information design methods from Strack and Yang (2024), this paper provides decision problem agnostic conditions under which separation training preference free and applying preferences ex post is optimal. Unlike prior work that requires specifying downstream objectives, the welfare results here apply uniformly across decision problems. The key primitive is a diminishing-value-of-information condition: relative to a fixed (normalised) preference-free loss, preference embedding makes informativeness less valuable at the margin, inducing a mean-preserving contraction of learned posteriors. Because the value of information is convex in beliefs, preference-free training weakly dominates for any expected utility decision problem. This provides theoretical foundations for modular AI pipelines that learn calibrated probabilities and implement asymmetric costs through downstream decision rules. However, separation requires users to implement optimal decision rules. When cognitive constraints bind, as documented in human AI decision-making, preference embedding can dominate by automating threshold computation. These results provide design guidance: preserve optionality through post-processing when objectives may shift; embed preferences when decision-stage frictions dominate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18732v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Discover: A Generalized Framework for Raga Identification without Forgetting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18766</link><description>arXiv:2601.18766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raga identification in Indian Art Music (IAM) remains challenging due to the presence of numerous rarely performed Ragas that are not represented in available training datasets. Traditional classification models struggle in this setting, as they assume a closed set of known categories and therefore fail to recognise or meaningfully group previously unseen Ragas. Recent works have tried categorizing unseen Ragas, but they run into a problem of catastrophic forgetting, where the knowledge of previously seen Ragas is diminished. To address this problem, we adopt a unified learning framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled audio, enabling the model to discover coherent categories corresponding to the unseen Ragas, while retaining the knowledge of previously known ones. We test our model on benchmark Raga Identification datasets and demonstrate its performance in categorizing previously seen, unseen, and all Raga classes. The proposed approach surpasses the previous NCD-based pipeline even in discovering the unseen Raga categories, offering new insights into representation learning for IAM tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18766v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Low-Bit Quantization of Bandlimited Graph Signals via Iterative Methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18782</link><description>arXiv:2601.18782v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Recent computational experiments have demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of self-replicating programs across universal automata, artificial chemistries, and self-modifying code systems. Remarkably, these results arise without explicit fitness functions, reward shaping, or predefined objectives, indicating a gap in our formal understanding of the underlying computational process.
  In this work, we argue that self-replication is computationally inevitable under resource-bounded automata. Building on algorithmic information theory, we show that when universal inductive bias is applied under finite constraints of time, memory, and description length, programs that construct descriptions of themselves, i.e., quines, emerge as stable fixed points of nested algorithmic probability. We formalize this argument and demonstrate that self-replicating programs act as attractors in program space, independent of external optimization criteria. Thus, resource bounds transform universal induction into a competitive ecological process over programs, in which self-constructing programs dominate by stabilizing their own measure under resampling.
  We reinterpret recent results from computational life experiments and self-improving artificial agents as empirical realizations of this theoretical principle. More broadly, we propose that life is the simplest persistent structure available to constrained computation. A living system remembers itself because doing so is algorithmically and thermodynamically unavoidable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2010.09646v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GFlowNet Foundations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09266</link><description>arXiv:2111.09266v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have been introduced as a method to sample a diverse set of candidates in an active learning context, with a training objective that makes them approximately sample in proportion to a given reward function. In this paper, we show a number of additional theoretical properties of GFlowNets. They can be used to estimate joint probability distributions and the corresponding marginal distributions where some variables are unspecified and, of particular interest, can represent distributions over composite objects like sets and graphs. GFlowNets amortize the work typically done by computationally expensive MCMC methods in a single but trained generative pass. They could also be used to estimate partition functions and free energies, conditional probabilities of supersets (supergraphs) given a subset (subgraph), as well as marginal distributions over all supersets (supergraphs) of a given set (graph). We introduce variations enabling the estimation of entropy and mutual information, sampling from a Pareto frontier, connections to reward-maximizing policies, and extensions to stochastic environments, continuous actions and modular energy functions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2111.09266v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PyMAF-X: Towards Well-aligned Full-body Model Regression from Monocular Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06400</link><description>arXiv:2207.06400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PyMAF-X, a regression-based approach to recovering parametric full-body models from monocular images. This task is very challenging since minor parametric deviation may lead to noticeable misalignment between the estimated mesh and the input image. Moreover, when integrating part-specific estimations into the full-body model, existing solutions tend to either degrade the alignment or produce unnatural wrist poses. To address these issues, we propose a Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) loop in our regression network for well-aligned human mesh recovery and extend it as PyMAF-X for the recovery of expressive full-body models. The core idea of PyMAF is to leverage a feature pyramid and rectify the predicted parameters explicitly based on the mesh-image alignment status. Specifically, given the currently predicted parameters, mesh-aligned evidence will be extracted from finer-resolution features accordingly and fed back for parameter rectification. To enhance the alignment perception, an auxiliary dense supervision is employed to provide mesh-image correspondence guidance while spatial alignment attention is introduced to enable the awareness of the global contexts for our network. When extending PyMAF for full-body mesh recovery, an adaptive integration strategy is proposed in PyMAF-X to produce natural wrist poses while maintaining the well-aligned performance of the part-specific estimations.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) now acts as a fundamental part of optimization in current machine learning. Meanwhile, deep learning architectures have shown outstanding performance in a wide range of fields, such as natural language processing, bioinformatics, and computer vision. Nevertheless, as the parameter size $d$ increases, these models encounter serious efficiency challenges. Previous studies show that the per step calculation expense scales linearly with the input size $d$. To mitigate this, our paper explores inherent patterns, such as Kronecker products within the training examples. We consider input data points that can be represented as tensor products of lower-dimensional vectors. We introduce a novel stochastic optimization method where the computational load for every update scales sublinearly with $d$, assuming moderate structural properties of the inputs. We believe our research is the first work achieving this result, representing a significant step forward for efficient deep learning optimization. Our theoretical findings are supported by a formal theorem, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm can train a two-layer fully connected neural network with a per-iteration cost independent of $d$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2305.08001v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The First and Second-Order Asymptotics of Covert Communication over AWGN Channels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17924</link><description>arXiv:2305.17924v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotics of the maximal throughput of communication over AWGN channels by $n$ channel uses under a covert constraint in terms of an upper bound $\delta$ of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence). It is shown that the first and second order asymptotics of the maximal throughput are $\sqrt{n\delta \log e}$ and $(2)^{1/2}(n\delta)^{1/4}(\log e)^{3/4}\cdot Q^{-1}(\epsilon)$, respectively. The technique we use in the achievability is quasi-$\varepsilon$-neighborhood notion from information geometry. For finite blocklength $n$, the generating distributions are chosen to be a family of truncated Gaussian distributions with decreasing variances. The law of decreasing is carefully designed so that it maximizes the throughput at the main channel in the asymptotic sense under the condition that the output distributions satisfy the covert constraint. For the converse, the optimality of Gaussian distribution for minimizing KL divergence under the second order moment constraint is extended from dimension $1$ to dimension $n$. Based on that, we establish an upper bound on the average power of the code to satisfy the covert constraint, which further leads to the direct converse bound in terms of covert metric.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2305.17924v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Near-Optimal Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning with Partial Online State Information</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08762</link><description>arXiv:2306.08762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a general framework for sequential decision-making under latent state uncertainty, yet learning in POMDPs is intractable in the worst case. Motivated by sensing and probing constraints in practice, we study how much online state information (OSI) is sufficient to enable efficient learning guarantees. We formalize a model in which the learner can query only partial OSI (POSI) during interaction. We first prove an information-theoretic hardness result showing that, for general POMDPs, achieving an $\epsilon$-optimal policy can require sample complexity that is exponential unless full OSI is available. We then identify two structured subclasses that remain learnable under POSI and propose corresponding algorithms with provably efficient performance guarantees. In particular, we establish regret upper bounds with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{K})$ dependence on the number of episodes $K$, together with complementary lower bounds, thereby delineating when POSI suffices for efficient reinforcement learning. Our results highlight a principled separation between intractable and tractable regimes under incomplete online state access and provide new tools for jointly optimizing POSI queries and learning control actions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2306.08762v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ELIP: Efficient Discriminative Language-Image Pre-training with Fewer Vision Tokens</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16738</link><description>arXiv:2309.16738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning a versatile language-image model is computationally prohibitive under a limited computing budget. This paper delves into the \emph{efficient language-image pre-training}, an area that has received relatively little attention despite its importance in reducing computational cost and footprint. To that end, we propose a vision token pruning and merging method ELIP, to remove less influential tokens based on the supervision of language outputs. Our method is designed with several strengths, such as being computation-efficient, memory-efficient, and trainable-parameter-free, and is distinguished from previous vision-only token pruning approaches by its alignment with task objectives. We implement this method in a progressively pruning manner using several sequential blocks. To evaluate its generalization performance, we apply ELIP to three commonly used language-image pre-training models and utilize public image-caption pairs with 4M images for pre-training. Our experiments demonstrate that with the removal of ~30$\%$ vision tokens across 12 ViT layers, ELIP maintains significantly comparable performance with baselines ($\sim$0.32 accuracy drop on average) over various downstream tasks including cross-modal retrieval, VQA, image captioning, \emph{etc}. In addition, the spared GPU resources by our ELIP allow us to scale up with larger batch sizes, thereby accelerating model pre-training and even sometimes enhancing downstream model performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2309.16738v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Computationally Efficient Maximum A Posteriori Sequence Estimation via Stein Variational Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08684</link><description>arXiv:2312.08684v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State estimation in robotic systems presents significant challenges, particularly due to the prevalence of multimodal posterior distributions in real-world scenarios. One effective strategy for handling such complexity is to compute maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequences over a discretized or sampled state space, which enables a concise representation of the most likely state trajectory. However, this approach often incurs substantial computational costs, especially in high-dimensional settings. In this article, we propose a novel MAP sequence estimation method, Stein-MAP-Seq, which effectively addresses multimodality while substantially reducing computational and memory overhead. Our key contribution is a sequential variational inference framework that captures temporal dependencies in dynamical system models and integrates Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) into a Viterbi-style dynamic programming algorithm, enabling computationally efficient MAP sequence estimation. This integration allows the method to focus computational effort on MAP-consistent modes rather than exhaustively exploring the entire state space. Stein-MAP-Seq inherits the parallelism and mode-seeking behavior of SVGD, allowing particle updates to be efficiently executed on parallel hardware and significantly reducing the number of trajectory candidates required for MAP-sequence recursion compared to conventional methods that rely on hundreds to thousands of particles. We validate the proposed approach on a range of highly multimodal scenarios, including nonlinear dynamics with ambiguous observations, unknown data association with outliers, range-only localization under temporary unobservability, and high-dimensional robotic manipulators. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in estimation accuracy and robustness to multimodality over existing estimation methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2312.08684v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An abstract framework for heterogeneous coupling: stability, approximation and preconditioning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11733</link><description>arXiv:2312.11733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider heterogeneous coupling problems on an abstract level, establishing fundamental principles of domain decomposition agnostic to the solvers of the local subproblems. Introducing a coupling framework reminiscent of FETI methods, but here on abstract form, we establish conditions for stability and minimal requirements for well-posedness on the continuous level, as well as conditions on local solvers for the approximation of subproblems. We then discuss stability of the resulting Lagrange multiplier methods and show stability under a mesh condition between the local discretizations and the mortar space. If this condition is not satisfied we show how a stabilization, acting only on the multiplier can be used to achieve stability. The design of preconditioners of the Schur complement system is discussed in the unstabilized case. Finally we discuss some applications that enter the framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2312.11733v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parameterized Hardware Design with Latency-Abstract Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02570</link><description>arXiv:2401.02570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardware designs must use latency-insensitive (LI) interfaces when timing is input-dependent. When timing is input-independent, designs should use latency-sensitive (LS) interfaces for maximum performance. However, designs commonly use LI interfaces to integrate with externally generated LS modules--from, e.g., IP generators, high-level synthesis, or domain specific languages. In every fully integrated design, such uses of LI represent pure overhead. The challenge is that generators can dramatically change timing interfaces of the modules to meet performance objectives, and LI interfaces act as a useful design abstraction and enable timing adaptation.
  We define latency-abstract (LA) interfaces, a new design abstraction, which provide the timing adaptability of LI interfaces at design-time and the efficient integration of LS interfaces. LA interfaces use output parameters, a novel compile-time mechanism for child modules to return values parent modules, to abstract and encapsulate timing behaviors at design time. During design elaboration, LA interfaces are compiled into efficient LS interfaces based on parameter values. While an attractive option, LA interfaces inherit the complexities of parameterized hardware design: the user must reason how parameters influence timing behaviors of modules and ensure that designs adapt to interface changes. To address this challenge and demonstrate the utility of LA interfaces, we design Lilac, a parameterized HDL that uses a type system track the influence of parameters on timing behaviors and formally guarantee that every parameterization of an LA design results in a circuit without structural hazards.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2401.02570v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inconsistency Masks: Harnessing Model Disagreement for Stable Semi-Supervised Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14387</link><description>arXiv:2401.14387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A primary challenge in semi-supervised learning (SSL) for segmentation is the confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, which destabilizes training and degrades performance. We propose Inconsistency Masks (IM), a framework that reframes model disagreement not as noise to be averaged away, but as a valuable signal for identifying uncertainty. IM leverages an ensemble of teacher models to generate a mask that explicitly delineates regions where predictions diverge. By filtering these inconsistent areas from input-pseudo-label pairs, our method effectively mitigates the cycle of error propagation common in both continuous and iterative self-training paradigms. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes benchmark demonstrate IM's effectiveness as a general enhancement framework: when paired with leading approaches like iMAS, U$^2$PL, and UniMatch, our method consistently boosts accuracy, achieving superior benchmarks across ResNet-50 and DINOv2 backbones, and even improving distilled architectures like SegKC. Furthermore, the method's robustness is confirmed in resource-constrained scenarios where pre-trained weights are unavailable. On three additional diverse datasets from medical and underwater domains trained entirely from scratch, IM significantly outperforms standard SSL baselines. Notably, the IM framework is dataset-agnostic, seamlessly handling binary, multi-class, and complex multi-label tasks by operating on discretized predictions. By prioritizing training stability, IM offers a generalizable and robust solution for semi-supervised segmentation, particularly in specialized areas lacking large-scale pre-training data.

Abstract: Deep learning-based sound event localization and classification is an emerging research area within wireless acoustic sensor networks. However, current methods for sound event localization and classification typically rely on a single microphone array, making them susceptible to signal attenuation and environmental noise, which limits their monitoring range. Moreover, methods using multiple microphone arrays often focus solely on source localization, neglecting the aspect of sound event classification. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method that employs multiple features and attention mechanisms to estimate the location and class of sound source. We introduce a Soundmap feature to capture spatial information across multiple frequency bands. We also use the Gammatone filter to generate acoustic features more suitable for outdoor environments. Furthermore, we integrate attention mechanisms to learn channel-wise relationships and temporal dependencies within the acoustic features. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments using simulated datasets with different levels of noise and size of monitoring areas, as well as different arrays and source positions. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in both sound event classification and sound source localization tasks. And we provide further analysis to explain the reasons for the observed errors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2403.20130v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Perturbation Effects on Accuracy and Fairness among Similar Individuals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01356</link><description>arXiv:2404.01356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that degrade both predictive accuracy and individual fairness, posing critical risks in high-stakes online decision-making. The relationship between these two dimensions of robustness remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we introduce robust individual fairness (RIF), which requires that similar individuals receive predictions consistent with the same ground truth even under adversarial manipulation. To evaluate and expose violations of RIF, we propose RIFair, an attack framework that applies identical perturbations to similar individuals to induce accuracy or fairness failures. We further introduce perturbation impact index (PII) and perturbation impact direction (PID) to quantify and explain why identical perturbations produce unequal effects on individuals who should behave similarly. Experiments across diverse model architectures and real-world web datasets reveal that existing robustness metrics capture distinct and often incompatible failure modes in accuracy and fairness. We find that many online applicants are simultaneously vulnerable to multiple types of adversarial failures, and that inaccurate or unfair outcomes arise due to similar individuals share the same PID but have sharply different PIIs, leading to divergent prediction-change trajectories in which some cross decision boundaries earlier. Finally, we demonstrate that adversarial examples generated by RIFair can strategically manipulate test-set accuracy or fairness by replacing only a small subset of items, creating misleading impressions of model performance. These findings expose fundamental limitations in current robustness evaluations and highlight the need for jointly assessing accuracy and fairness under adversarial perturbations in high-stakes online decision-making.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.01356v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unifying Low Dimensional Observations in Deep Learning Through the Deep Linear Unconstrained Feature Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06106</link><description>arXiv:2404.06106v2 Announce Type: replace

We show that deep neural collapse underlies these phenomena, deriving explicit expressions for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of many deep learning matrices in terms of class feature means. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the full Hessian inherits its low dimensional structure from the layerwise Hessians, and empirically validate our theory in both UFMs and deep networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.06106v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Multimodal Feature Distillation with Mamba-Transformer Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Incomplete Modalities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14019</link><description>arXiv:2404.14019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing brain tumor segmentation methods usually utilize multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities in brain tumor images for segmentation, which can achieve better segmentation performance. However, in clinical applications, some modalities are often missing due to resource constraints, resulting in significant performance degradation for methods that rely on complete modality segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal feature distillation with Mamba-Transformer hybrid network (MMTSeg) for accurate brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. We first employ a Multimodal Feature Distillation (MFD) module to distill feature-level multimodal knowledge into different unimodalities to extract complete modality information. We further develop an Unimodal Feature Enhancement (UFE) module to model the semantic relationship between global and local information. Finally, we built a Cross-Modal Fusion (CMF) module to explicitly align the global correlations across modalities, even when some modalities are missing. Complementary features within and across modalities are refined by the Mamba-Transformer hybrid architectures in both the UFE and CMF modules, dynamically capturing long-range dependencies and global semantic information for complex spatial contexts. A boundary-wise loss function is employed as the segmentation loss of the proposed MMTSeg to minimize boundary discrepancies for a distance-based metric. Our ablation study demonstrates the importance of the proposed feature enhancement and fusion modules in the proposed network and the Transformer with Mamba block for improving the performance of brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate that the proposed MMTSeg framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods when modalities are missing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.14019v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring the Frontiers of Softmax: Provable Optimization, Applications in Diffusion Model, and Beyond</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03251</link><description>arXiv:2405.03251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The softmax activation function plays a crucial role in the success of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the self-attention mechanism of the widely adopted Transformer architecture. However, the underlying learning dynamics that contribute to the effectiveness of softmax remain largely unexplored. As a step towards better understanding, this paper provides a theoretical study of the optimization and generalization properties of two-layer softmax neural networks, providing theoretical insights into their superior performance as other activation functions, such as ReLU and exponential. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework, our analysis reveals that the normalization effect of the softmax function leads to a good perturbation property of the induced NTK matrix, resulting in a good convex region of the loss landscape. Consequently, softmax neural networks can learn the target function in the over-parametrization regime. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our theoretical findings, we apply them to the task of learning score estimation functions in diffusion models, a promising approach for generative modeling. Our analysis shows that gradient-based algorithms can learn the score function with a provable accuracy. Our work provides a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of softmax neural networks and their potential in various domains, paving the way for further advancements in natural language processing and beyond.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.03251v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training Tensor Attention Efficiently: From Cubic to Almost Linear Time</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16411</link><description>arXiv:2405.16411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor Attention, a multi-view attention that is able to capture high-order correlations among multiple modalities, can overcome the representational limitations of classical matrix attention. However, the $O(n^3)$ time complexity of tensor attention poses a significant obstacle to its utilization in transformers, where $n$ is the input sequence length. In this work, we prove that the backward gradient of tensor attention training can be computed in almost linear time $n^{1+o(1)}$, the same complexity as its forward computation under the bounded entries assumption. We provide a closed-form solution for the gradient and propose a fast computation method utilizing polynomial approximation methods and tensor algebraic techniques. Furthermore, we prove the necessity and tightness of our assumption through hardness analysis, showing that slightly weakening it renders the gradient problem unsolvable in truly subcubic time. Our theoretical results establish the feasibility of efficient higher-order transformer training and may facilitate practical applications of tensor attention architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.16411v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fully tensorial approach to hypercomplex-valued neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00449</link><description>arXiv:2407.00449v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fully tensorial theoretical framework for hypercomplex-valued neural networks is presented. The proposed approach enables neural network architectures to operate on data defined over arbitrary finite-dimensional algebras. The central observation is that algebra multiplication can be represented by a rank-three tensor, which allows all algebraic operations in neural network layers to be formulated in terms of standard tensor contractions, permutations, and reshaping operations.
  This tensor-based formulation provides a unified and dimension-independent description of hypercomplex-valued dense and convolutional layers and is directly compatible with modern deep learning libraries supporting optimized tensor operations. The proposed framework recovers existing constructions for four-dimensional algebras as a special case.
  Within this setting, a tensor-based version of the universal approximation theorem for single-layer hypercomplex-valued perceptrons is established under mild non-degeneracy assumptions on the underlying algebra, thereby providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for the considered class of neural networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.00449v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring LGBTQ+ Bias in Generative AI Answers across Different Country and Religious Contexts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03473</link><description>arXiv:2407.03473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous discussions have highlighted the need for generative AI tools to become more culturally sensitive, yet often neglect the complexities of handling content about minorities, who are perceived differently across cultures and religions. Our study examined how two generative AI systems respond to homophobic statements with varying cultural and religious context information. Findings showed ChatGPT 3.5's replies exhibited cultural relativism, in contrast to Bard's, which stressed human rights and provided more support for LGBTQ+ issues. Both demonstrated significant change in responses based on contextual information provided in the prompts, suggesting that AI systems may adjust in their responses the degree and forms of support for LGBTQ+ people according to information they receive about the user's background. The study contributes to understanding the social and ethical implications of AI responses and argues that any work to make generative AI outputs more culturally diverse requires a grounding in fundamental human rights.

Abstract: Despite recent strides made by AI in image processing, the issue of mixed exposure, pivotal in many real-world scenarios like surveillance and photography, remains inadequately addressed. Traditional image enhancement techniques and current transformer models are limited with primary focus on either overexposure or underexposure. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified-Exposure Guided Transformer (Unified-EGformer). Our proposed solution is built upon advanced transformer architectures, equipped with local pixel-level refinement and global refinement blocks for color correction and image-wide adjustments. We employ a guided attention mechanism to precisely identify exposure-compromised regions, ensuring its adaptability across various real-world conditions. U-EGformer, with a lightweight design featuring a memory footprint (peak memory) of only $\sim$1134 MB (0.1 Million parameters) and an inference time of 95 ms (9.61x faster than the average), is a viable choice for real-time applications such as surveillance and autonomous navigation. Additionally, our model is highly generalizable, requiring minimal fine-tuning to handle multiple tasks and datasets with a single architecture.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.13170v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Programming Model for Disaggregated Memory over CXL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16300</link><description>arXiv:2407.16300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed.
  It enables cache-coherent, shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with various storage devices using simple loads and stores.
  While CXL unleashes unique opportunities, it also introduces challenges of data management and crash consistency.
  For example, CXL currently lacks an adequate programming model, making it impossible to reason about the correctness and behavior of systems on top.
  In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs over CXL.
  We propose a high-level abstraction for memory accesses and formally define operational semantics.
  We demonstrate that CXL0 captures a wide range of current and future CXL setups and perform initial measurements on real hardware.
  To illustrate the usefulness of CXL0, we present a general transformation that enhances any linearizable concurrent algorithm with durability in a distributed partial-crash setting.
  We believe that this work will serve as a stepping stone for systems design and programming on top of CXL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.16300v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Space-Time Isogeometric Method for a Nonlocal Parabolic Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00450</link><description>arXiv:2408.00450v3 Announce Type: replace

We prove the existence of the discrete solution and also establish the a priori error estimate for the space-time isogeometric scheme. The non-linear system is linearized through Picards method and a suitable preconditioner for the linearized system is provided. Finally, to confirm the theoretical findings, results of some numerical experiments are presented.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.00450v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeNOTS: Stable Deep Neural ODEs for Time Series</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08055</link><description>arXiv:2408.08055v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural CDEs provide a natural way to process the temporal evolution of irregular time series. The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.08055v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Darkness to Detail: Frequency-Aware SSMs for Low-Light Vision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09650</link><description>arXiv:2408.09650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a persistent challenge in computer vision, where state-of-the-art models are often hampered by hardware constraints and computational inefficiency, particularly at high resolutions. While foundational architectures like transformers and diffusion models have advanced the field, their computational complexity limits their deployment on edge devices. We introduce ExpoMamba, a novel architecture that integrates a frequency-aware state-space model within a modified U-Net. ExpoMamba is designed to address mixed-exposure challenges by decoupling the modeling of amplitude (intensity) and phase (structure) in the frequency domain. This allows for targeted enhancement, making it highly effective for real-time applications, including downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ExpoMamba is up to 2-3x faster than competing models and achieves a 6.8\% PSNR improvement, establishing a new state-of-the-art in efficient, high-quality low-light enhancement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence, excelling in numerous tasks. Although the functionality of a model is inherently tied to its parameters, a systematic method for exploring the connections between the parameters and the functionality are lacking. Models sharing similar structure and parameter counts exhibit significant performance disparities across various tasks, prompting investigations into the varying patterns that govern their performance. We adopted a mutagenesis screen approach inspired by the methods used in biological studies, to investigate Llama2-7b and Zephyr. This technique involved mutating elements within the models' matrices to their maximum or minimum values to examine the relationship between model parameters and their functionalities. Our research uncovered multiple levels of fine structures within both models. Many matrices showed a mixture of maximum and minimum mutations following mutagenesis, but others were predominantly sensitive to one type. Notably, mutations that produced phenotypes, especially those with severe outcomes, tended to cluster along axes. Additionally, the location of maximum and minimum mutations often displayed a complementary pattern on matrix in both models, with the Gate matrix showing a unique two-dimensional asymmetry after rearrangement. In Zephyr, certain mutations consistently resulted in poetic or conversational rather than descriptive outputs. These "writer" mutations grouped according to the high-frequency initial word of the output, with a marked tendency to share the row coordinate even when they are in different matrices. Our findings affirm that the mutagenesis screen is an effective tool for deciphering the complexities of large language models and identifying unexpected ways to expand their potential, providing deeper insights into the foundational aspects of AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.11494v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Detecting null patterns in tensor data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17425</link><description>arXiv:2408.17425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a class of efficiently computable null patterns for tensor data. The class includes familiar patterns such as block-diagonal decompositions explored in statistics and signal processing, low-rank tensor decompositions, and Tucker decompositions. It also includes a new family of null patterns -- not known to be detectable by current methods -- that can be thought of as continuous decompositions approximating curves and surfaces. We present a general algorithm to detect null patterns in each class using a parameter we call a \textit{chisel} that tunes the search to patterns of a prescribed shape. We also show that the patterns output by the algorithm are essentially unique.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.17425v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multiview Random Vector Functional Link Network for Predicting DNA-Binding Proteins</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02588</link><description>arXiv:2409.02588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) is essential due to their significant impact on various biological activities. Understanding the mechanisms underlying protein-DNA interactions is essential for elucidating various life activities. In recent years, machine learning-based models have been prominently utilized for DBP prediction. In this paper, to predict DBPs, we propose a novel framework termed a multiview random vector functional link (MvRVFL) network, which fuses neural network architecture with multiview learning. The MvRVFL model integrates both late and early fusion advantages, enabling separate regularization parameters for each view, while utilizing a closed-form solution for efficiently determining unknown parameters. The primal objective function incorporates a coupling term aimed at minimizing a composite of errors stemming from all views. From each of the three protein views of the DBP datasets, we extract five features. These features are then fused together by incorporating a hidden feature during the model training process. The performance of the proposed MvRVFL model on the DBP dataset surpasses that of baseline models, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We further validate the practicality of the proposed model across diverse benchmark datasets, and both theoretical analysis and empirical results consistently demonstrate its superior generalization performance over baseline models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.02588v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MEDIC: Comprehensive Evaluation of Leading Indicators for LLM Safety and Utility in Clinical Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07314</link><description>arXiv:2409.07314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superhuman performance on standardized medical licensing exams, these static benchmarks have become saturated and increasingly disconnected from the functional requirements of clinical workflows. To bridge the gap between theoretical capability and verified utility, we introduce MEDIC, a comprehensive evaluation framework establishing leading indicators across various clinical dimensions. Beyond standard question-answering, we assess operational capabilities using deterministic execution protocols and a novel Cross-Examination Framework (CEF), which quantifies information fidelity and hallucination rates without reliance on reference texts. Our evaluation across a heterogeneous task suite exposes critical performance trade-offs: we identify a significant knowledge-execution gap, where proficiency in static retrieval does not predict success in operational tasks such as clinical calculation or SQL generation. Furthermore, we observe a divergence between passive safety (refusal) and active safety (error detection), revealing that models fine-tuned for high refusal rates often fail to reliably audit clinical documentation for factual accuracy. These findings demonstrate that no single architecture dominates across all dimensions, highlighting the necessity of a portfolio approach to clinical model deployment. As part of this investigation, we released a public leaderboard on Hugging Face.\footnote{https://huggingface.co/spaces/m42-health/MEDIC-Benchmark}</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.07314v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Finite Element Simulation of Modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck/Navier-Stokes Model for Compressible Electrolytes under Mechanical Equilibrium</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08746</link><description>arXiv:2409.08746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a finite element method for a modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck/Navier-Stokes (PNP/NS) model under the mechanical equilibrium, developed for compressible electrolytes. Another key contribution of this work is the reduction of the equilibrium system to a modified Poisson-Boltzmann system. The proposed numerical scheme is capable of handling both compressible and incompressible regimes by employing a bulk modulus parameter, which governs the fluid's compressibility and enables seamless transition between these regimes. To emphasize practical relevance, we discuss the implications of compressible electrolytes in the context of double-layer capacitance behavior. We also conduct numerical simulations over various domains to demonstrate its applicability under various operating conditions, including temperature fluctuations and variations in the bulk modulus. The numerical results validate the accuracy and robustness of our computational scheme and demonstrate that the observed limiting behavior for the incompressible regime aligns with the theoretical trends anticipated by Dreyer et al.

Abstract: This article investigates the influential role of flexible antenna array curvature on the performance of 6G communication systems with carrier frequencies above 100 GHz. It is demonstrated that the curvature of flexible antenna arrays can be leveraged for 2-dimensional beam alignment in phased arrays with relatively small insertion loss. The effect of antenna array bending on the radiation properties such as gain and antenna impedance are analytically studied and simulated for a 4x4 microstrip patch antenna array operating between 97.5-102.5 GHz. Moreover, the deployment of this flexible antenna array in conjunction with state-of-the-art flexible board packaging techniques is examined for 6G wireless transceivers based on 65nm CMOS technology and simulated for three variants of quadrature amplitude modulation (4QAM, 16 QAM, and 64 QAM). The communication performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) is evaluated using analytical derivations and simulation results which exhibit a relatively close match.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.09590v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semantic2D: Enabling Semantic Scene Understanding with 2D Lidar Alone</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09899</link><description>arXiv:2409.09899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a complete semantic scene understanding workflow using only a single 2D lidar. This fills the gap in 2D lidar semantic segmentation, thereby enabling the rethinking and enhancement of existing 2D lidar-based algorithms for application in various mobile robot tasks. It introduces the first publicly available 2D lidar semantic segmentation dataset and the first fine-grained semantic segmentation algorithm specifically designed for 2D lidar sensors on autonomous mobile robots. To annotate this dataset, we propose a novel semi-automatic semantic labeling framework that requires minimal human effort and provides point-level semantic annotations. The data was collected by three different types of 2D lidar sensors across twelve indoor environments, featuring a range of common indoor objects. Furthermore, the proposed semantic segmentation algorithm fully exploits raw lidar information -- position, range, intensity, and incident angle -- to deliver stochastic, point-wise semantic segmentation. We present a series of semantic occupancy grid mapping experiments and demonstrate two semantically-aware navigation control policies based on 2D lidar. These results demonstrate that the proposed semantic 2D lidar dataset, semi-automatic labeling framework, and segmentation algorithm are effective and can enhance different components of the robotic navigation pipeline.

Abstract: In fine-grained road scene understanding, semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in enabling vehicles to perceive and comprehend their surroundings. By assigning a specific class label to each pixel in an image, it allows for precise identification and localization of detailed road features, which is vital for high-quality scene understanding and downstream perception tasks. A key challenge in this domain lies in improving the recognition performance of minority classes while mitigating the dominance of majority classes, which is essential for achieving balanced and robust overall performance. However, traditional semi-supervised learning methods often train models overlooking the imbalance between classes. To address this issue, firstly, we propose a general training module that learns from all the pseudo-labels without a conventional filtering strategy. Secondly, we propose a professional training module to learn specifically from reliable minority-class pseudo-labels identified by a novel mismatch score metric. The two modules are crossly supervised by each other so that it reduces model coupling which is essential for semi-supervised learning. During contrastive learning, to avoid the dominance of the majority classes in the feature space, we propose a strategy to assign evenly distributed anchors for different classes in the feature space. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks show that our method surpasses traditional approaches in recognizing tail classes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.12680v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] InteLiPlan: An Interactive Lightweight LLM-Based Planner for Domestic Robot Autonomy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14506</link><description>arXiv:2409.14506v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an interactive LLM-based framework designed to enhance the autonomy and robustness of domestic robots, targeting embodied intelligence. Our approach reduces reliance on large-scale data and incorporates a robot-agnostic pipeline that embodies an LLM. Our framework, InteLiPlan, ensures that the LLM's decision-making capabilities are effectively aligned with robotic functions, enhancing operational robustness and adaptability, while our human-in-the-loop mechanism allows for real-time human intervention when user instruction is required. We evaluate our method in both simulation and on the real robot platforms, including a Toyota Human Support Robot and an ANYmal D robot with a Unitree Z1 arm. Our method achieves a 95% success rate in the `fetch me' task completion with failure recovery, highlighting its capability in both failure reasoning and task planning.

Abstract: Segre-Veronese manifolds are smooth submanifolds of tensors comprising the partially symmetric rank-1 tensors. We investigate a one-parameter family of warped geometries of Segre-Veronese manifolds, which includes the standard Euclidean geometry. This parameter controls by how much spherical tangent directions are weighted relative to radial tangent directions. We present closed expressions for the exponential map, the logarithmic map, and the intrinsic distance on these warped Segre-Veronese manifolds, which can be computed efficiently numerically. It is shown that Segre-Veronese manifolds are not geodesically connected in the Euclidean geometry, while they are for some values of the warping parameter. The benefits of geodesics connectedness may outweigh using the Euclidean geometry in certain applications. One such application is presented: numerically computing the Riemannian center of mass for averaging rank-1 tensors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.00664v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How to Make LMs Strong Node Classifiers?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02296</link><description>arXiv:2410.02296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly challenging the dominance of domain-specific models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers (GTs), in graph learning tasks. Following this trend, we propose a novel approach that empowers off-the-shelf LMs to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNNs on node classification tasks, without requiring any architectural modification. By preserving the LM's original architecture, our approach retains a key benefit of LM instruction tuning: the ability to jointly train on diverse datasets, fostering greater flexibility and efficiency. To achieve this, we introduce two key augmentation strategies: (1) Enriching LMs' input using topological and semantic retrieval methods, which provide richer contextual information, and (2) guiding the LMs' classification process through a lightweight GNN classifier that effectively prunes class candidates. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that backbone Flan-T5 LMs equipped with these augmentation strategies outperform SOTA text-output node classifiers and are comparable to top-performing vector-output node classifiers. By bridging the gap between specialized node classifiers and general LMs, this work paves the way for more versatile and widely applicable graph learning models. We will open-source the code upon publication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.02296v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Debate, Deliberate, Decide (D3): A Cost-Aware Adversarial Framework for Reliable and Interpretable LLM Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04663</link><description>arXiv:2410.04663v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging due to inconsistency, bias, and the absence of transparent decision criteria in automated judging. We present Debate, Deliberate, Decide (D3), a cost-aware, adversarial multi-agent framework that orchestrates structured debate among role-specialized agents (advocates, a judge, and an optional jury) to produce reliable and interpretable evaluations. D3 instantiates two complementary protocols: (1) Multi-Advocate One-Round Evaluation (MORE), which elicits k parallel defenses per answer to amplify signal via diverse advocacy, and (2) Single-Advocate Multi-Round Evaluation (SAMRE) with budgeted stopping, which iteratively refines arguments under an explicit token budget and convergence checks. We develop a probabilistic model of score gaps that (i) characterizes reliability and convergence under iterative debate and (ii) explains the separation gains from parallel advocacy. Under mild assumptions, the posterior distribution of the round-r gap concentrates around the true difference and the probability of mis-ranking vanishes; moreover, aggregating across k advocates provably increases expected score separation. We complement theory with a rigorous experimental suite across MT-Bench, AlignBench, and AUTO-J, showing state-of-the-art agreement with human judgments (accuracy and Cohen's kappa), reduced positional and verbosity biases via anonymization and role diversification, and a favorable cost-accuracy frontier enabled by budgeted stopping. Ablations and qualitative analyses isolate the contributions of debate, aggregation, and anonymity. Together, these results establish D3 as a principled, practical recipe for reliable, interpretable, and cost-aware LLM evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.04663v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CLIP's Visual Embedding Projector is a Few-shot Cornucopia</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05270</link><description>arXiv:2410.05270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ProLIP, a simple and architecture-agnostic method for adapting contrastively pretrained vision-language models, such as CLIP, to few-shot classification. ProLIP fine-tunes the vision encoder's projection matrix with Frobenius norm regularization on its deviation from the pretrained weights. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 few-shot classification benchmarks under both ``few-shot validation'' and ``validation-free'' settings. Moreover, by rethinking the non-linear CLIP-Adapter through ProLIP's lens, we design a Regularized Linear Adapter (RLA) that performs better, requires no hyperparameter tuning, is less sensitive to learning rate values, and offers an alternative to ProLIP in black-box scenarios where model weights are inaccessible. Beyond few-shot classification, ProLIP excels in cross-dataset transfer, domain generalization, base-to-new class generalization, and test-time adaptation--where it outperforms prompt tuning while being an order of magnitude faster to train.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific example was used to train a given language model. While prior work has explored prompt-based attacks such as ReCALL, these methods rely heavily on the assumption that using known non-members as prompts reliably suppresses the model's responses to non-member queries. We propose EM-MIA, a new membership inference approach that iteratively refines prefix effectiveness and membership scores using an expectation-maximization strategy without requiring labeled non-member examples. To support controlled evaluation, we introduce OLMoMIA, a benchmark that enables analysis of MIA robustness under systematically varied distributional overlap and difficulty. Experiments on WikiMIA and OLMoMIA show that EM-MIA outperforms existing baselines, particularly in settings with clear distributional separability. We highlight scenarios where EM-MIA succeeds in practical settings with partial distributional overlap, while failure cases expose fundamental limitations of current MIA methods under near-identical conditions. We release our code and evaluation pipeline to encourage reproducible and robust MIA research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.07582v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parameterized Spanning Tree Congestion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08314</link><description>arXiv:2410.08314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Spanning Tree Congestion problem, where we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and are asked to find a spanning tree $T$ of minimum maximum congestion. Here, the congestion of an edge $e\in T$ is the number of edges $uv\in E$ such that the (unique) path from $u$ to $v$ in $T$ traverses $e$. We consider this well-studied NP-hard problem from the point of view of (structural) parameterized complexity and obtain the following results.
  We resolve a natural open problem by showing that Spanning Tree Congestion is not FPT parameterized by treewidth (under standard assumptions). More strongly, we present a generic reduction which applies to (almost) any parameter of the form ``vertex-deletion distance to class $\mathcal{C}$'', thus obtaining W[1]-hardness for parameters more restricted than treewidth, including tree-depth plus feedback vertex set, or incomparable to treewidth, such as twin cover. Via a slight tweak of the same reduction we also show that the problem is NP-complete on graphs of modular-width $4$.
  Even though it is known that Spanning Tree Congestion remains NP-hard on instances with only one vertex of unbounded degree, it is currently open whether the problem remains hard on bounded-degree graphs. We resolve this question by showing NP-hardness on graphs of maximum degree 8.

Abstract: Modern autonomous systems with machine learning components often use uncertainty quantification to help produce assurances about system operation. However, there is a lack of consensus in the community on what uncertainty is and how to perform uncertainty quantification. In this work, we propose that uncertainty measures should be understood within the context of overall system design and operation. To this end, we present two novel analysis techniques. First, we produce a probabilistic specification on a module's uncertainty measure given a system specification. Second, we propose a method to measure a system's input-output robustness in order to compare system designs and quantify the impact of making a system uncertainty-aware. In addition to this theoretical work, we present the application of these analyses on two real-world autonomous systems: an autonomous driving system and an aircraft runway incursion detection system. We show that our analyses can determine desired relationships between module uncertainty and error, provide visualizations of how well an uncertainty measure is being used by a system, produce principled comparisons between different uncertainty measures and decision-making algorithm designs, and provide insights into system vulnerabilities and tradeoffs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.12019v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CaTs and DAGs: Integrating Directed Acyclic Graphs with Transformers for Causally Constrained Predictions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14485</link><description>arXiv:2410.14485v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), including fully-connected networks and transformers, are highly flexible and powerful function approximators, widely applied in fields like computer vision and natural language processing. However, their inability to inherently respect causal structures can limit their robustness, making them vulnerable to covariate shift and difficult to interpret/explain. This poses significant challenges for their reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Causal Transformers (CaTs), a general model class designed to operate under predefined causal constraints, as specified by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). CaTs retain the powerful function approximation abilities of traditional neural networks while adhering to the underlying structural constraints, improving robustness, reliability, and interpretability at inference time. This approach opens new avenues for deploying neural networks in more demanding, real-world scenarios where robustness and explainability is critical.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.14485v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A chiseling algorithm for low-rank Grassmann decomposition of skew-symmetric tensors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14486</link><description>arXiv:2410.14486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical algorithm to decompose an exact low-rank skew-symmetric tensor into a sum of elementary (rank-$1$) skew-symmetric tensors is introduced.

The Grassmann decomposition can be recovered, up to scale, from a diagonalization of a generic element in this kernel.

Abstract: We present LingGen, a controlled text generation model that allows fine-grained control over a large number of real-valued linguistic attributes. It encodes target attribute values with a dedicated linguistic attribute encoder and conditions the language model by injecting the resulting representation into the language model using the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) embeddings. To improve robustness when controlling different attribute subsets, we introduce P-MASKING, which samples per-example attribute masking rates from a truncated Pareto distribution during training. Across 1-40 control attributes, LingGen achieves the lowest average control error among evaluated methods, while remaining efficient at inference and receiving the highest fluency scores in human evaluation. Ablations show that Pareto-sampled masking and BOS-based injection are effective choices compared to alternative masking and integration variants.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.24201v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploiting Unlabeled Data with Multiple Expert Teachers for Open Vocabulary Aerial Object Detection and Its Orientation Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02057</link><description>arXiv:2411.02057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, aerial object detection has been increasingly pivotal in various earth observation applications. However, current algorithms are limited to detecting a set of pre-defined object categories, demanding sufficient annotated training samples, and fail to detect novel object categories. In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation of the aerial object detection problem, namely open-vocabulary aerial object detection (OVAD), which can detect objects beyond training categories without costly collecting new labeled data. We propose CastDet, a CLIP-activated student-teacher detection framework that serves as the first OVAD detector specifically designed for the challenging aerial scenario, where objects often exhibit weak appearance features and arbitrary orientations. Our framework integrates a robust localization teacher along with several box selection strategies to generate high-quality proposals for novel objects. Additionally, the RemoteCLIP model is adopted as an omniscient teacher, which provides rich knowledge to enhance classification capabilities for novel categories. A dynamic label queue is devised to maintain high-quality pseudo-labels during training. By doing so, the proposed CastDet boosts not only novel object proposals but also classification. Furthermore, we extend our approach from horizontal OVAD to oriented OVAD with tailored algorithm designs to effectively manage bounding box representation and pseudo-label generation. Extensive experiments for both tasks on multiple existing aerial object detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/VisionXLab/CastDet.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.02057v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Communicate Less, Synthesize the Rest: Latency-aware Intent-based Generative Semantic Multicasting with Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02334</link><description>arXiv:2411.02334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality, enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal into multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate, to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users' reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.02334v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Internal Representations of Recommendation Models with Sparse Autoencoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06112</link><description>arXiv:2411.06112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommendation model interpretation aims to reveal the relationships between inputs, model internal representations and outputs to enhance the transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness of recommendation systems. However, the inherent complexity and opacity of deep learning models pose challenges for model-level interpretation. Moreover, most existing methods for interpreting recommendation models are tailored to specific architectures or model types, limiting their generalizability across different types of recommenders. In this paper, we propose RecSAE, a generalizable probing framework that interprets Recommendation models with Sparse AutoEncoders. The framework extracts interpretable latents from the internal representations of recommendation models, and links them to semantic concepts for interpretations. It does not alter original models during interpretations and also enables targeted tuning to models. Experiments on three types of recommendation models (general, graph-based, sequential) with four widely used public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of RecSAE framework. The interpreted concepts are further validated by human experts, showing strong alignment with human perception. Overall, RecSAE serves as a novel step in both model-level interpretations to various types of recommendation models without affecting their functions and offering potential for targeted tuning of models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.06112v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Your Extreme Multi-label Classifier is Secretly a Hierarchical Text Classifier for Free</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13687</link><description>arXiv:2411.13687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assigning a set of labels to a given text is a classification problem with many real-world applications, such as recommender systems. Two separate research streams address this issue. Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) focuses on datasets with label pools of hundreds of entries, accompanied by a semantic label hierarchy. In contrast, eXtreme Multi-Label Text Classification (XML) considers very large sets of labels with up to millions of entries but without an explicit hierarchy. In XML methods, it is common to construct an artificial hierarchy in order to deal with the large label space before or during the training process. Here, we investigate how state-of-the-art HTC models perform when trained and tested on XML datasets and vice versa using three benchmark datasets from each of the two streams. Our results demonstrate that XML models, with their internally constructed hierarchy, are very effective HTC models. HTC models, on the other hand, are not equipped to handle the sheer label set size of XML datasets and achieve poor transfer results. We further argue that for a fair comparison in HTC and XML, more than one metric like F1 should be used but complemented with P@k and R-Precision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.13687v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CARE Transformer: Mobile-Friendly Linear Visual Transformer via Decoupled Dual Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16170</link><description>arXiv:2411.16170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, large efforts have been made to design efficient linear-complexity visual Transformers. However, current linear attention models are generally unsuitable to be deployed in resource-constrained mobile devices, due to suffering from either few efficiency gains or significant accuracy drops. In this paper, we propose a new de\textbf{C}oupled du\textbf{A}l-interactive linea\textbf{R} att\textbf{E}ntion (CARE) mechanism, revealing that features' decoupling and interaction can fully unleash the power of linear attention. We first propose an asymmetrical feature decoupling strategy that asymmetrically decouples the learning process for local inductive bias and long-range dependencies, thereby preserving sufficient local and global information while effectively enhancing the efficiency of models. Then, a dynamic memory unit is employed to maintain critical information along the network pipeline. Moreover, we design a dual interaction module to effectively facilitate interaction between local inductive bias and long-range information as well as among features at different layers. By adopting a decoupled learning way and fully exploiting complementarity across features, our method can achieve both high efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO, and ADE20K datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, e.g., achieving $78.4/82.1\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImagegNet-1K at the cost of only $0.7/1.9$ GMACs.

Abstract: The evolving landscape of edge computing envisions platforms operating as dynamic intermediaries between application providers and edge servers (ESs), where task offloading is coupled with payments for computational services. Ensuring efficient resource utilization and meeting stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements necessitates incentivizing ESs while optimizing the platforms operational objectives.

We propose a novel Stackelberg game-based framework to model interactions between stakeholders and solve the optimization problem using a Bayesian Optimization-based centralized algorithm. Recognizing practical challenges in information collection due to privacy concerns, we further design a decentralized solution leveraging neural network optimization and a privacy-preserving information exchange protocol. Extensive numerical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in achieving superior performance compared to existing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.17782v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GeneMAN: Generalizable Single-Image 3D Human Reconstruction from Multi-Source Human Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18624</link><description>arXiv:2411.18624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a single in-the-wild human photo, it remains a challenging task to reconstruct a high-fidelity 3D human model. Existing methods face difficulties including a) the varying body proportions captured by in-the-wild human images; b) diverse personal belongings within the shot; and c) ambiguities in human postures and inconsistency in human textures. In addition, the scarcity of high-quality human data intensifies the challenge. To address these problems, we propose a Generalizable image-to-3D huMAN reconstruction framework, dubbed GeneMAN, building upon a comprehensive multi-source collection of high-quality human data, including 3D scans, multi-view videos, single photos, and our generated synthetic human data. GeneMAN encompasses three key modules. 1) Without relying on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), GeneMAN first trains a human-specific text-to-image diffusion model and a view-conditioned diffusion model, serving as GeneMAN 2D human prior and 3D human prior for reconstruction, respectively. 2) With the help of the pretrained human prior models, the Geometry Initialization-&amp;-Sculpting pipeline is leveraged to recover high-quality 3D human geometry given a single image. 3) To achieve high-fidelity 3D human textures, GeneMAN employs the Multi-Space Texture Refinement pipeline, consecutively refining textures in the latent and the pixel spaces. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GeneMAN could generate high-quality 3D human models from a single image input, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. Notably, GeneMAN could reveal much better generalizability in dealing with in-the-wild images, often yielding high-quality 3D human models in natural poses with common items, regardless of the body proportions in the input images.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.18624v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Real-time Adaptation of Embodied Agent in Human-Robot Collaboration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00435</link><description>arXiv:2412.00435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened transformative possibilities for human-robot collaboration. However, enabling real-time collaboration requires both low latency and robust reasoning, and most LLMs suffer from high latency. To address this gap, we first propose a fine-grained benchmark that explicitly assesses agents' proactive adaptability and temporal responsiveness in the Overcooked-AI environment. Based on evaluation results, we propose MonTA (Monitor-then-Adapt), a hierarchical framework inspired by cognitive science research. MonTA contains three key modules: a lightweight Monitor that operates at high frequency (7 Hz) to detect adaptation needs, and two proficient Adapters for subtask and path adaptation reasoning that provide instructions to humans at a lower frequency. Our results demonstrate that MonTA significantly outperforms baseline agents on our proposed benchmark, achieving superior performance across layouts with varying teaming fluency. User studies confirm the high reasonableness of adaptation plans and consistent language instructions provided by our framework to humans.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.00435v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RoPE Attention Can Be Trained in Almost Linear Time</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17316</link><description>arXiv:2412.17316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) mechanism has become a powerful enhancement to the Transformer architecture, which enables models to capture token relationships when encoding positional information. However, the RoPE mechanisms make the computations of attention mechanisms more complicated, which makes efficient algorithms challenging. Earlier research introduced almost linear time algorithms for the forward computation under specific parameter settings of bounded entries (i.e., in time $n^{1+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the number of input tokens), but has not addressed backward computation. In this work, we develop the first almost linear time algorithm for backward computations in the RoPE-based attention under bounded entries. Our approach builds on recent advancements in fast RoPE attention computations, utilizing a novel combination of the polynomial method and the Fast Fourier Transform. Furthermore, we show that with lower bounds derived from the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), the bounded entry condition is necessary for subquadratic performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.17316v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Empirical Analysis of Nature-Inspired Algorithms for Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Using 3D Video Dataset</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01202</link><description>arXiv:2501.01202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental condition characterized by repetitive behaviors and impairments in social and communication skills. Despite the clear manifestation of these symptoms, many individuals with ASD remain undiagnosed. This paper proposes a methodology for ASD detection using a three-dimensional walking video dataset, leveraging supervised machine learning classification algorithms combined with nature-inspired optimization algorithms for feature extraction. The approach employs supervised classifiers to identify ASD cases, while nature-inspired optimization techniques select the most relevant features, enhanced by the use of ranking coefficients to identify initial leading particles. This strategy significantly reduces computational time, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy. Experimental evaluation with various algorithmic combinations demonstrates an exceptional classification accuracy of 100% in the best case when using the Random Forest classifier coupled with the Gravitational Search Algorithm for feature selection. The methodology's application to additional datasets promises improved robustness and generalizability. With its high accuracy and reduced computational requirements, the proposed framework offers significant contributions to both medical and academic fields, providing a foundation for future advances in ASD diagnosis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.01202v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Kolmogorov equations for evaluating the boundary hitting of degenerate diffusion with unsteady drift</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02729</link><description>arXiv:2501.02729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jacobi diffusion is a representative diffusion process whose solution is bounded in a domain under certain conditions about drift and diffusion coefficients. However, the process without such conditions has not been investigated well. We explore a Jacobi diffusion whose drift coefficient is affected by another deterministic process, causing the process to hit the boundary of a domain in finite time. The Kolmogorov equation (a degenerate elliptic partial differential equation) for evaluating the boundary hitting of the proposed Jacobi diffusion is then presented and analyzed. We also investigate a related mean-field-type (McKean-Vlasov) self-consistent model arising in tourism management, where the drift depends on the index for sensor boundary hitting, thereby confining the process to a domain with higher probability. We propose a finite difference method for the linear and nonlinear Kolmogorov equations, which yields a unique numerical solution due to discrete ellipticity. Accuracy of the finite difference method critically depends on the regularity of the boundary condition, and the use of high-order discretization is not always effective. Finally, we computationally investigate the mean field effect.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.02729v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cooperative Optimal Output Tracking for Discrete-Time Multiagent Systems: Stabilizing Policy Iteration Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06510</link><description>arXiv:2501.06510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes two cooperative optimal output tracking (COOT) algorithms based on policy iteration (PI) for discrete-time multi-agent systems with unknown model parameters. First, we establish a stabilizing PI framework that can start from any initial control policy, relaxing the dependence of traditional PI on the initial stabilizing control policy. Then, another efficient and equivalent Q-learning framework is developed, which is shown to require only less system data to get the same results as the stabilizing PI. In the two frameworks, the stabilizing control policy is obtained by gradually iterating the stabilizing virtual system to the actual feedback closed-loop system. Two explicit schemes for adjusting the iteration step-size/coefficient are designed and their stability is analyzed. Finally, the COOT is realized by a distributed feedforward-feedback controller with learned optimal gains. The proposed algorithms are validated by simulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.06510v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems via Large Language Models: A User-Centric Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09493</link><description>arXiv:2501.09493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) integrate both recommendation and dialogue tasks, making their evaluation uniquely challenging. Existing approaches primarily assess CRS performance by separately evaluating item recommendation and dialogue management using rule-based metrics. However, these methods fail to capture the real human experience, and they cannot draw direct conclusions about the system's overall performance. As conversational recommender systems become increasingly vital in e-commerce, social media, and customer support, the ability to evaluate both recommendation accuracy and dialogue management quality using a single metric, thereby authentically reflecting user experience, has become the principal challenge impeding progress in this field.
  In this work, we propose a user-centric evaluation framework based on large language models (LLMs) for CRSs, namely Conversational Recommendation Evaluator (CoRE). CoRE consists of two main components: (1) LLM-As-Evaluator. Firstly, we comprehensively summarize 12 key factors influencing user experience in CRSs and directly leverage LLM as an evaluator to assign a score to each factor. (2) Multi-Agent Debater. Secondly, we design a multi-agent debate framework with four distinct roles (common user, domain expert, linguist, and HCI expert) to discuss and synthesize the 12 evaluation factors into a unified overall performance score.
  Furthermore, we apply the proposed framework to evaluate four CRSs on two benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that CoRE aligns well with human evaluation in most of the 12 factors and the overall assessment. Especially, CoRE's overall evaluation scores demonstrate significantly better alignment with human feedback compared to existing rule-based metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.09493v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Hypergraphs with Looped Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10688</link><description>arXiv:2501.10688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Looped Transformers have shown exceptional neural algorithmic reasoning capability in simulating traditional graph algorithms, but their application to more complex structures like hypergraphs remains underexplored. Hypergraphs generalize graphs by modeling higher-order relationships among multiple entities, enabling richer representations but introducing significant computational challenges. In this work, we extend the Loop Transformer architecture's neural algorithmic reasoning capability to simulate hypergraph algorithms, addressing the gap between neural networks and combinatorial optimization over hypergraphs. Specifically, we propose a novel degradation mechanism for reducing hypergraphs to graph representations, enabling the simulation of graph-based algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path. Furthermore, we introduce a hyperedge-aware encoding scheme to simulate hypergraph-specific algorithms, exemplified by Helly's algorithm. We establish theoretical guarantees for these simulations, demonstrating the feasibility of processing high-dimensional and combinatorial data using Loop Transformers.

These properties make it useful for approximating the Shannon entropy in linear programming and maximum entropy problems, studying the optimal length of conditional encoding, and bounding the entropy of monotonic mixture distributions. In particular, it can give a bound $I(X;Y)+\log(I(X;Y)+3.4)+1$ for the strong functional representation lemma which is optimal within $2.8$ bits, and significantly improves upon the best known bound.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.13736v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TLXML: Task-Level Explanation of Meta-Learning via Influence Functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14271</link><description>arXiv:2501.14271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-learning enables models to rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging prior experience, but its adaptation mechanisms remain opaque, especially regarding how past training tasks influence future predictions. We introduce TLXML (Task-Level eXplanation of Meta-Learning), a novel framework that extends influence functions to meta-learning settings, enabling task-level explanations of adaptation and inference. By reformulating influence functions for bi-level optimization, TLXML quantifies the contribution of each meta-training task to the adapted model's behaviour. To ensure scalability, we propose a Gauss-Newton-based approximation that significantly reduces computational complexity from $O(pq^2)$ to $O(pq)$, where p and q denote model and meta parameters, respectively. Results demonstrate that TLXML effectively ranks training tasks by their influence on downstream performance, offering concise and intuitive explanations aligned with user-level abstraction.

Abstract: Bias-variance decompositions are widely used to understand the generalization performance of machine learning models. While the squared error loss permits a straightforward decomposition, other loss functions - such as zero-one loss or $L_1$ loss - either fail to sum bias and variance to the expected loss or rely on definitions that lack the essential properties of meaningful bias and variance. Recent research has shown that clean decompositions can be achieved for the broader class of Bregman divergences, with the cross-entropy loss as a special case. However, the necessary and sufficient conditions for these decompositions remain an open question.
  In this paper, we address this question by studying continuous, nonnegative loss functions that satisfy the identity of indiscernibles (zero loss if and only if the two arguments are identical), under mild regularity conditions. We prove that so-called $g$-Bregman or rho-tau divergences are the only such loss functions that have a clean bias-variance decomposition. A $g$-Bregman divergence can be transformed into a standard Bregman divergence through an invertible change of variables. This makes the squared Mahalanobis distance, up to such a variable transformation, the only symmetric loss function with a clean bias-variance decomposition. Consequently, common metrics such as $0$-$1$ and $L_1$ losses cannot admit a clean bias-variance decomposition, explaining why previous attempts have failed. We also examine the impact of relaxing the restrictions on the loss functions and how this affects our results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.18581v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating the Modality Gap: Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection with Multi-modal Prototypes and Image Bias Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00662</link><description>arXiv:2502.00662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing vision-language model (VLM)-based methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection typically rely on similarity scores between input images and in-distribution (ID) text prototypes. However, the modality gap between image and text often results in high false positive rates, as OOD samples can exhibit high similarity to ID text prototypes. To mitigate the impact of this modality gap, we propose incorporating ID image prototypes along with ID text prototypes. We present theoretical analysis and empirical evidence indicating that this approach enhances VLM-based OOD detection performance without any additional training. To further reduce the gap between image and text, we introduce a novel few-shot tuning framework, SUPREME, comprising biased prompts generation (BPG) and image-text consistency (ITC) modules. BPG enhances image-text fusion and improves generalization by conditioning ID text prototypes on the Gaussian-based estimated image domain bias; ITC reduces the modality gap by minimizing intra- and inter-modal distances. Moreover, inspired by our theoretical and empirical findings, we introduce a novel OOD score $S_{\textit{GMP}}$, leveraging uni- and cross-modal similarities. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate that SUPREME consistently outperforms existing VLM-based OOD detection methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.00662v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PixFoundation: Are We Heading in the Right Direction with Pixel-level Vision Foundation Models?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04192</link><description>arXiv:2502.04192v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple works have emerged to push the boundaries of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) towards pixel-level understanding. The current trend is to train MLLMs with pixel-level grounding supervision in terms of masks on large-scale labelled data and specialized decoders for the segmentation task. However, we show that such MLLMs when evaluated on recent challenging vision-centric benchmarks, exhibit a weak ability in visual question answering (VQA). Surprisingly, some of these methods even downgrade the grounding ability of MLLMs that were never trained with such pixel-level supervision. In this work, we propose two novel challenging benchmarks with paired evaluation for both VQA and grounding. We demonstrate that simple baselines that are not unified achieve performance that matches or surpasses some of the pixel-level MLLMs. Our paired benchmarks and evaluation enable additional analysis on the reasons for failure with respect to VQA and/or grounding. Furthermore, we propose a prompt sensitivity analysis on both the language and visual prompts tailored for the grounding task. More importantly, we study the research question of ``When does grounding emerge in MLLMs with respect to the output tokens?'' We propose an interpretability tool that can be plugged into any MLLM to study the aforementioned question. We show that grounding does not necessarily coincide with the exact referring expression in the output, but can coincide with the object parts, its location, appearance, context or state.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for codifying and automating optimization strategies to efficiently deploy deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained hardware, such as FPGAs, while maintaining high performance, accuracy, and resource efficiency. Deploying DNNs on such platforms involves addressing the significant challenge of balancing performance, resource usage (e.g., DSPs and LUTs), and inference accuracy, which often requires extensive manual effort and domain expertise. Our novel approach addresses two core key issues: (i)~encoding custom optimization strategies and (ii)~enabling cross-stage optimization search. In particular, our proposed framework seamlessly integrates programmatic DNN optimization techniques with high-level synthesis (HLS)-based metaprogramming, leveraging advanced design space exploration (DSE) strategies like Bayesian optimization to automate both top-down and bottom-up design flows. Hence, we reduce the need for manual intervention and domain expertise. In addition, the framework introduces customizable optimization, transformation, and control blocks to enhance DNN accelerator performance and resource efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 92\% DSP and 89\% LUT usage reduction for select networks, while preserving accuracy, along with a 15.6-fold reduction in optimization time compared to grid search. These results highlight the potential for automating the generation of resource-efficient DNN accelerator designs with minimum effort.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.05850v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Impact of the Utility in Semivalue-based Data Valuation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06574</link><description>arXiv:2502.06574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semivalue-based data valuation uses cooperative-game theory intuitions to assign each data point a value reflecting its contribution to a downstream task. Still, those values depend on the practitioner's choice of utility, raising the question: How robust is semivalue-based data valuation to changes in the utility? This issue is critical when the utility is set as a trade-off between several criteria and when practitioners must select among multiple equally valid utilities. We address it by introducing the notion of a dataset's spatial signature: given a semivalue, we embed each data point into a lower-dimensional space where any utility becomes a linear functional, making the data valuation framework amenable to a simpler geometric picture. Building on this, we propose a practical methodology centered on an explicit robustness metric that informs practitioners whether and by how much their data valuation results will shift as the utility changes. We validate this approach across diverse datasets and semivalues, demonstrating strong agreement with rank-correlation analyses and offering analytical insight into how choosing a semivalue can amplify or diminish robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.06574v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Models as Proxies for Theories of Human Linguistic Cognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07687</link><description>arXiv:2502.07687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the possible role of current large language models (LLMs) in the study of human linguistic cognition. We focus on the use of such models as proxies for theories of cognition that are relatively linguistically-neutral in their representations and learning but differ from current LLMs in key ways. We illustrate this potential use of LLMs as proxies for theories of cognition in the context of two kinds of questions: (a) whether the target theory accounts for the acquisition of a given pattern from a given corpus; and (b) whether the target theory makes a given typologically-attested pattern easier to acquire than another, typologically-unattested pattern. For each of the two questions we show, building on recent literature, how current LLMs can potentially be of help, but we note that at present this help is quite limited.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.07687v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMs and Childhood Safety: Identifying Risks and Proposing a Protection Framework for Safe Child-LLM Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11242</link><description>arXiv:2502.11242v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in child-facing contexts such as education, companionship, creative tools, but their deployment raises safety, privacy, developmental, and security risks. We conduct a systematic literature review of child-LLM interaction risks and organize findings into a structured map that separates (i) parent-reported concerns, (ii) empirically documented harms, and (iii) gaps between perceived and observed risk. Moving beyond descriptive listing, we compare how different evidence streams in surveys, incident reports, youth interaction logs, and governance guidance operationalize "harm," where they conflict, and what mitigations they imply. Based on this synthesis, we propose a protection framework that couples child-specific content safety and developmental sensitivity with security-grade controls for adversarial misuse, including prompt injection and multimodal jailbreak pathways. The framework specifies measurable evaluation targets (e.g., harmful-content avoidance, age-calibrated readability, bias parity checks, prompt-injection robustness, and monitoring transparency) to support developers, educators, and policymakers in assessing and improving child-safe LLM deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.11242v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Visual Knowledge Forgetting in MLLM Instruction-tuning via Modality-decoupled Gradient Descent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11740</link><description>arXiv:2502.11740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent MLLMs have shown emerging visual understanding and reasoning abilities after being pre-trained on large-scale multimodal datasets. Unlike pre-training, where MLLMs receive rich visual-text alignment, instruction-tuning is often text-driven with weaker visual supervision, leading to the degradation of pre-trained visual understanding and causing visual forgetting. Existing approaches, such as direct fine-tuning and continual learning methods, fail to explicitly address this issue, often compressing visual representations and prioritizing task alignment over visual retention, which further worsens visual forgetting. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel perspective leveraging effective rank to quantify the degradation of visual representation richness, interpreting this degradation through the information bottleneck principle as excessive compression that leads to the degradation of crucial pre-trained visual knowledge. Building on this view, we propose a modality-decoupled gradient descent (MDGD) method that regulates gradient updates to maintain the effective rank of visual representations while mitigating the over-compression effects described by the information bottleneck. By explicitly disentangling the optimization of visual understanding from task-specific alignment, MDGD preserves pre-trained visual knowledge while enabling efficient task adaptation. To enable lightweight instruction-tuning, we further develop a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach using gradient masking, which selectively updates a subset of model parameters to enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reducing computational overhead while preserving rich visual representations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks and backbone MLLMs demonstrate that MDGD effectively mitigates visual forgetting from pre-trained tasks while enabling strong adaptation to new tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.11740v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMPopcorn: Exploring LLMs as Assistants for Popular Micro-video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12945</link><description>arXiv:2502.12945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an era where micro-videos dominate platforms like TikTok and YouTube, AI-generated content is nearing cinematic quality. The next frontier is using large language models (LLMs) to autonomously create viral micro-videos, a largely untapped potential that could shape the future of AI-driven content creation. To address this gap, this paper presents the first exploration of LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). We selected popcorn as the icon for this paper because it symbolizes leisure and entertainment, aligning with this study on leveraging LLMs as assistants for generating popular micro-videos that are often consumed during leisure time. Specifically, we empirically study the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task? Exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 can generate micro-videos with popularity rivaling human content. Prompt enhancement further boosts results, while benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and R1 for LLMs, and LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo for video generation. This work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation and opens new research directions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, demonstrating strong capabilities in tasks such as text generation, summarization, and reasoning. Recently, their potential for automating precise text editing tasks across specialized domains, such as programming code, LaTeX, and structured database languages, has gained attention. However, current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with executing precise, instruction-driven edits, particularly when structural accuracy and strict adherence to domain conventions are required. To address these challenges, we introduce InstrEditBench, an automated benchmark dataset comprising over 30,000 structured editing tasks spanning diverse domains, including Wikipedia articles, LaTeX documents, source code, and database languages. Using this benchmark, we develop FineEdit, a specialized editing model explicitly trained for accurate, context-aware text modifications. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FineEdit outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving improvements of approximately 10\% over Gemini models on single-turn edits, up to 30\% over Llama-3.2-3B, and exceeding Mistral-7B-OpenOrca performance by over 40\% on direct editing tasks. FineEdit also effectively generalizes to realistic multi-turn editing scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, we release FineEdit at https://github.com/StuRinDQB/FineEdit} and https://huggingface.co/datasets/YimingZeng/FineEdit_bench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.13358v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pretrain Value, Not Reward: Decoupled Value Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16944</link><description>arXiv:2502.16944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how directly pretraining a value model simplifies and stabilizes reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In reinforcement learning, value estimation is the key to policy optimization, distinct from reward supervision. The value function predicts the \emph{return-to-go} of a partial answer, that is, how promising the partial answer is if it were continued to completion. In RLHF, however, the standard pipeline first pretrains a reward model and then learns a value function online, even though no new reward signals are available once preference data is collected. This makes critic learning redundant, as the process of training a reward model and then deriving a value model is informationally equivalent to directly pretraining a value model. Importantly, this requires no additional supervision, and our value model is trained on exactly the same data used for reward modeling. Building on this insight, we introduce \emph{Decoupled Value Policy Optimization} (DVPO), a framework that pretrains a \emph{Global Value Model} (GVM) offline and freezes it as a universal critic for policy learning. The GVM provides stable, fine-grained credit assignment without critic drift or trajectory sampling. Experiments across MT-Bench, Alpaca-Eval, and Arena-Hard demonstrate that DVPO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art RLHF methods. These results highlight RLHF can be reframed as policy-only optimization guided by a single pretrained value model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.16944v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structural Alignment Improves Graph Test-Time Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18334</link><description>arXiv:2502.18334v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-based learning excels at capturing interaction patterns in diverse domains like recommendation, fraud detection, and particle physics. However, its performance often degrades under distribution shifts, especially those altering network connectivity. Current methods to address these shifts typically require retraining with the source dataset, which is often infeasible due to computational or privacy limitations. We introduce Test-Time Structural Alignment (TSA), a novel algorithm for Graph Test-Time Adaptation (GTTA) that adapts a pretrained model to align graph structures during inference without the cost of retraining. Grounded in a theoretical understanding of graph data distribution shifts, TSA employs three synergistic strategies: uncertainty-aware neighborhood weighting to accommodate neighbor label distribution shifts, adaptive balancing of self-node and aggregated neighborhood representations based on their signal-to-noise ratio, and decision boundary refinement to correct residual label and feature shifts. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate TSA's consistent outperformance of both non-graph TTA methods and state-of-the-art GTTA baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.18334v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FilterRAG: Zero-Shot Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Mitigate Hallucinations in VQA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18536</link><description>arXiv:2502.18536v3 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: We study the following reachability problem for piecewise affine maps: Given two vectors $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{Q}^d$ and a piecewise affine map $f \colon \mathbb{Q}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}^d$, does there exist $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{n}(\mathbf{s}) = \mathbf{t}$? In this work, we focus on this reachability problem for a subclass of piecewise affine maps -- Bellman operators arising from Markov decision processes. We prove that the reachability problem for $\max$- and $\min$-Bellman operators is decidable in any dimension under either of the following conditions: (i) the target vector $\mathbf{t}$ is not the fixed point of the operator $f$; or (ii) the initial and target vectors $\mathbf{s}$ and $\mathbf{t}$ are comparable with respect to the componentwise order. Furthermore, we show that in the two-dimensional case, the reachability problem for Bellman operators is decidable for arbitrary $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{Q}^2$. This stands in sharp contrast to the known undecidability of reachability for general piecewise affine maps in dimension $d = 2$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.19923v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Actor-Critic Cooperative Compensation to Model Predictive Control for Off-Road Autonomous Vehicles Under Unknown Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00577</link><description>arXiv:2503.00577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an Actor-Critic Cooperative Compensated Model Predictive Controller (AC3MPC) designed to address unknown system dynamics. To avoid the difficulty of modeling highly complex dynamics and ensuring realtime control feasibility and performance, this work uses deep reinforcement learning with a model predictive controller in a cooperative framework to handle unknown dynamics. The model-based controller takes on the primary role as both controllers are provided with predictive information about the other. This improves tracking performance and retention of inherent robustness of the model predictive controller. We evaluate this framework for off-road autonomous driving on unknown deformable terrains that represent sandy deformable soil, sandy and rocky soil, and cohesive clay-like deformable soil. Our findings demonstrate that our controller statistically outperforms standalone model-based and learning-based controllers by upto 29.2% and 10.2%. This framework generalized well over varied and previously unseen terrain characteristics to track longitudinal reference speeds with lower errors. Furthermore, this required significantly less training data compared to purely learning-based controller, while delivering better performance even when under-trained.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.00577v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MoSE: Hierarchical Self-Distillation Enhances Early Layer Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03008</link><description>arXiv:2503.03008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deploying language models often requires navigating accuracy vs. performance trade-offs to meet latency constraints while preserving utility. Traditional model distillation reduces size but incurs substantial costs through training separate models. We introduce ModularStarEncoder (MoSE), a 1-billion-parameter multi-exit encoder for code retrieval and classification that employs a novel Self-Distillation mechanism. This approach significantly enhances lower-layer representations, enabling flexible deployment of different model portions with favorable performance trade-offs. Our architecture improves text-to-code and code-to-code search by targeting specific encoder layers as exit heads, where higher layers guide earlier ones during training, thereby improving intermediate representations at minimal additional cost. We further enhance MoSE with a repository-level contextual loss that maximizes training context window utilization. Additionally, we release a new dataset created through code translation that extends text-to-code benchmarks with cross-language code-to-code pairs. Evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Self-Distillation as a principled approach to trading inference cost for accuracy across various code understanding tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.03008v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding and Detecting Platform-Specific Violations in Android Auto Apps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04003</link><description>arXiv:2503.04003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite over 3.5 million Android apps and 200+ million Android Auto-compatible vehicles, only a few hundred apps support Android Auto due to platform-specific compliance requirements. Android Auto mandates service-based architectures in which the vehicle system invokes app callbacks to render the UI and handle interactions, which is fundamentally different from standard Activity-based Android development. Through an empirical study analysis of 98 issues across 14 Android Auto app repositories, we identified three major compliance failure categories: media playback errors, UI rendering issues, and voice command integration failures in line with mandatory requirements for integrating Android Auto support. We introduce AutoComply, a static analysis framework capable of detecting these compliance violations through the specialized analysis of platform-specific requirements. AutoComply constructs a Car-Control Flow Graph (CCFG) extending traditional control flow analysis to model the service-based architecture of Android Auto apps. Evaluating AutoComply on 31 large-scale open-source apps, it detected 27 violations (13X more than Android Lint), while no false positives were observed, achieving 2X faster analysis. Developers have acknowledged 14 of these violations with 8 fixes already implemented, validating AutoComply's practical effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.04003v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FedMentalCare: Towards Privacy-Preserving Fine-Tuned LLMs to Analyze Mental Health Status Using Federated Learning Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05786</link><description>arXiv:2503.05786v3 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Achieving health equity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires diagnostic models that maintain reliability across diverse populations. However, breast cancer screening systems frequently suffer from domain overfitting, degrading significantly when deployed to varying demographics. While Invariant Learning algorithms aim to mitigate this by suppressing site-specific correlations, their efficacy in medical imaging remains underexplored. This study comprehensively evaluates domain generalization techniques for mammography.
  We constructed a multi-source training environment aggregating datasets from the United States (CBIS-DDSM, EMBED), Portugal (INbreast, BCDR), and Cyprus (BMCD). To assess global generalizability, we evaluated performance on unseen cohorts from Egypt (CDD-CESM) and Sweden (CSAW-CC). We benchmarked Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and Variance Risk Extrapolation (VREx) against a rigorously optimized Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) baseline. Contrary to expectations, standard ERM consistently outperformed specialized invariant mechanisms on out-of-domain testing. While VREx showed potential in stabilizing attention maps, invariant objectives proved unstable and prone to underfitting. We conclude that engineering equitable AI is currently best served by maximizing multi-national data diversity rather than relying on complex algorithmic invariance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.06759v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CtrlRAG: Black-box Document Poisoning Attacks for Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06950</link><description>arXiv:2503.06950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response credibility and traceability by displaying reference contexts, but this transparency simultaneously introduces a novel black-box attack vector. Existing document poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious documents into the knowledge base to manipulate RAG outputs, rely primarily on unrealistic white-box or gray-box assumptions, limiting their practical applicability. To address this gap, we propose CtrlRAG, a two-stage black-box attack that (1) constructs malicious documents containing misinformation or emotion-inducing content and injects them into the knowledge base, and (2) iteratively optimizes them using a localization algorithm and Masked Language Model (MLM) guided on reference context feedback, ensuring their retrieval priority while preserving linguistic naturalness. With only five malicious documents per target question injected into the million-document MS MARCO dataset, CtrlRAG achieves up to 90% attack success rates on commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), a 30% improvement over optimal baselines, in both *Emotion Manipulation* and *Hallucination Amplification* tasks. Furthermore, we show that existing defenses fail to balance security and performance. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a dynamic *Knowledge Expansion* defense strategy based on *Parametric/Non-parametric Memory Confrontation*, blocking 78% of attacks while maintaining 95.5% system accuracy. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG systems and provide effective defense strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.06950v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Comprehensive Survey of Mixture-of-Experts: Algorithms, Theory, and Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07137</link><description>arXiv:2503.07137v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved astonishing successes in many domains, especially with the recent breakthroughs in the development of foundational large models. These large models, leveraging their extensive training data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the development of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous consumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the difficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the usability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted much attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been shown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with fewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal data. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various domains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements of MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their limitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas, and we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic design of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms, training strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of MoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.07137v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time Load Estimation for Load-lifting Exoskeletons Using Insole Pressure Sensors and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07527</link><description>arXiv:2503.07527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enhance lifting-load estimation accuracy in industrial upper-limb assistive exoskeletons, this study proposes a machine learning-based approach using insole pressure sensors. Unlike traditional methods that rely on electromyography (EMG), force sensors, or posture data, insole pressure sensors provide a non-invasive, posture-independent, and stable solution suitable for long-term use. Lifting load data ranging from 2 to 10 kg (0.5 kg intervals) were collected from five subjects. Two data representations were investigated: channel-based vectors and map-based images. For the channel-based approach, conventional regression models (SVR, MLP, and Elastic Net) were trained on pooled data from all subjects to assess inter-subject generalization, specifically testing the ability to infer load levels unseen during training. In parallel, a preliminary feasibility study was conducted for the map-based deep learning model (MobileNetV2) using inner-subject data. Results indicate that the channel-based SVR achieved the most balanced accuracy and generalization performance, with a mean absolute error of 0.547 kg. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using insole pressure data for variable load estimation, supporting control strategies in industrial exoskeleton applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.07527v2</guid></item></channel></rss>
