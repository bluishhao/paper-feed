Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit unfaithful behavior, producing a final answer that differs significantly from their internal chain of thought (CoT) reasoning in order to appease the user they are conversing with. In order to better detect this behavior, we introduce the Hypocrisy Gap, a mechanistic metric utilizing Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to quantify the divergence between a model's internal reasoning and its final generation. By mathematically comparing an internal truth belief, derived via sparse linear probes, to the final generated trajectory in latent space, we quantify and detect a model's tendency to engage in unfaithful behavior. Experiments on Gemma, Llama, and Qwen models using Anthropic's Sycophancy benchmark show that our method achieves an AUROC of 0.55-0.73 for detecting sycophantic runs and 0.55-0.74 for hypocritical cases where the model internally "knows" the user is wrong, consistently outperforming a decision-aligned log-probability baseline (0.41-0.50 AUROC).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02496v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] STEMVerse: A Dual-Axis Diagnostic Framework for STEM Reasoning in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02497</link><description>arXiv:2602.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve significant breakthroughs in complex reasoning tasks, evaluating their proficiency in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has become a primary method for measuring machine intelligence. However, current evaluation paradigms often treat benchmarks as isolated "silos," offering only monolithic aggregate scores that neglect the intricacies of both academic specialization and cognitive depth. This result-oriented approach fails to distinguish whether model errors stem from insufficient domain knowledge or deficiencies in cognitive capacity, thereby limiting the diagnostic value. To address this, we propose STEMVerse, a diagnostic framework designed to systematically analyze the STEM reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This framework characterizes model performance across academic specialization and cognitive complexity to map the capability required for reasoning. We re-aggregate over 20,000 STEM problems from mainstream benchmarks into a unified "Discipline $\times$ Cognition" capability space, assigning dual-axis labels to every instance. Utilizing this unified diagnostic framework, we systematically evaluate representative LLM families across varying parameter scales and training paradigms. Our empirical results reveal structural failure patterns in STEM reasoning. By integrating multi-disciplinary coverage and fine-grained cognitive stratification into a unified framework, STEMVerse provides a clear and actionable perspective for understanding the scientific reasoning characteristics of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02497v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Test-Time Detoxification without Training or Learning Anything</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02498</link><description>arXiv:2602.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models can produce toxic or inappropriate text even for benign inputs, creating risks when deployed at scale. Detoxification is therefore important for safety and user trust, particularly when we want to reduce harmful content without sacrificing the model's generation quality. Many existing approaches rely on model retraining, gradients, or learned auxiliary components, which can be costly and may not transfer across model families or to truly black-box settings. We introduce a test-time procedure that approximates the gradient of completion toxicity with respect to the input embeddings and uses a small number of descent steps to steer generation toward less toxic continuations. This is achieved with zeroth-order optimization that requires only access to input embeddings, a toxicity scoring function, and forward evaluations of the model. Empirically, the approach delivers robust toxicity reductions across models and prompts and, in most settings, achieves the best overall toxicity-quality trade-off. More broadly, our work positions word embeddings as effective control variables and encourages wider use of black-box optimization to guide autoregressive language models toward scalable, safer text generation, without requiring any training or access to intermediate computations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02498v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ROSA-Tuning: Enhancing Long-Context Modeling via Suffix Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02499</link><description>arXiv:2602.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context capability and computational efficiency are among the central challenges facing today's large language models. Existing efficient attention methods reduce computational complexity, but they typically suffer from a limited coverage of the model state. This paper proposes ROSA-Tuning, a retrieval-and-recall mechanism for enhancing the long-context modeling ability of pretrained models. Beyond the standard attention mechanism, ROSA-Tuning introduces in parallel a CPU-based ROSA (RWKV Online Suffix Automaton) retrieval module, which efficiently locates historical positions in long contexts that are relevant to the current query, and injects the retrieved information into the model state in a trainable manner; subsequent weighted fusion can then be handled by range-restricted attention. To enable end-to-end training, we design a binary discretization strategy and a counterfactual gradient algorithm, and further optimize overall execution efficiency via an asynchronous CPU-GPU pipeline. Systematic evaluations on Qwen3-Base-1.7B show that ROSA-Tuning substantially restores the long-context modeling ability of windowed-attention models, achieving performance close to and in some cases matching global attention on benchmarks such as LongBench, while maintaining computational efficiency and GPU memory usage that are nearly comparable to windowed-attention methods, offering a new technical path for efficient long-context processing. The example code can be found at https://github.com/zyaaa-ux/ROSA-Tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02499v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Augmenting Parameter-Efficient Pre-trained Language Models with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02501</link><description>arXiv:2602.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training AI models in cybersecurity with help of vast datasets offers significant opportunities to mimic real-world behaviors effectively. However, challenges like data drift and scarcity of labelled data lead to frequent updates of models and the risk of overfitting. To address these challenges, we used parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques for pre-trained language models wherein we combine compacters with various layer freezing strategies. To enhance the capabilities of these pre-trained language models, in this work we introduce two strategies that use large language models. In the first strategy, we utilize large language models as data-labelling tools wherein they generate labels for unlabeled data. In the second strategy, large language modes are utilized as fallback mechanisms for predictions having low confidence scores. We perform comprehensive experimental analysis on the proposed strategies on different downstream tasks specific to cybersecurity domain. We empirically demonstrate that by combining parameter-efficient pre-trained models with large language models, we can improve the reliability and robustness of models, making them more suitable for real-world cybersecurity applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02501v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparse Adapter Fusion for Continual Learning in NLP</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02502</link><description>arXiv:2602.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning in natural language processing plays a crucial role in adapting to evolving data and preventing catastrophic forgetting. Despite significant progress, existing methods still face challenges, such as inefficient parameter reuse across tasks, risking catastrophic forgetting when tasks are dissimilar, and the unnecessary introduction of new parameters for each task, which hampers knowledge sharing among similar tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a Sparse Adapter Fusion Method (SAFM), which dynamically fuses old and new adapters to address these challenges. SAFM operates in two stages: the decision stage and the tuning stage. In the decision stage, SAFM determines whether to incorporate a new adapter, reuse an existing one, or add an empty adapter. The architecture search procedure, designed to prioritize reusing or adding empty adapters, minimizes parameter consumption and maximizes reuse. In the tuning stage, SAFM especially facilitates a layer-wise loss to encourage differentiation between adapters, effectively capturing knowledge within the same task. Experimental results consistently show that SAFM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving comparable performance while utilizing less than 60% of the parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02502v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning-augmented smooth integer programs with PAC-learnable oracles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02505</link><description>arXiv:2602.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates learning-augmented algorithms for smooth integer programs, covering canonical problems such as MAX-CUT and MAX-k-SAT. We introduce a framework that incorporates a predictive oracle to construct a linear surrogate of the objective, which is then solved via linear programming followed by a rounding procedure. Crucially, our framework ensures that the solution quality is both consistent and smooth against prediction errors. We demonstrate that this approach effectively extends tractable approximations from the classical dense regime to the near-dense regime. Furthermore, we go beyond the assumption of oracle existence by establishing its PAC-learnability. We prove that the induced algorithm class possesses a bounded pseudo-dimension, thereby ensuring that an oracle with near-optimal expected performance can be learned with polynomial samples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02505v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Precoding-Oriented CSI Feedback Design with Mutual Information Regularized VQ-VAE</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02508</link><description>arXiv:2602.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression at the user equipment plays a key role in enabling accurate channel reconstruction and precoder design in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. A key challenge lies in balancing the CSI feedback overhead with the achievable downlink rate, i.e., maximizing the utility of limited feedback to maintain high system performance. In this work, we propose a precoding-oriented CSI feedback framework based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder, augmented with an information-theoretic regularization. To achieve this, we introduce a differentiable mutual information lower-bound estimator as a training regularizer to promote effective utilization of the learned codebook under a fixed feedback budget. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves rates comparable to variable-length neural compression schemes, while operating with fixed-length feedback. Furthermore, the learned codewords exhibit significantly more uniform usage and capture interpretable structures that are strongly correlated with the underlying channel state information.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02508v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CodeGuard: Improving LLM Guardrails in CS Education</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02509</link><description>arXiv:2602.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in Computer Science (CS) classrooms to automate code generation, feedback, and assessment. However, their susceptibility to adversarial or ill-intentioned prompts threatens student learning and academic integrity. To cope with this important issue, we evaluate existing off-the-shelf LLMs in handling unsafe and irrelevant prompts within the domain of CS education. We identify important shortcomings in existing LLM guardrails which motivates us to propose CodeGuard, a comprehensive guardrail framework for educational AI systems. CodeGuard includes (i) a first-of-its-kind taxonomy for classifying prompts; (ii) the CodeGuard dataset, a collection of 8,000 prompts spanning the taxonomy; and (iii) PromptShield, a lightweight sentence-encoder model fine-tuned to detect unsafe prompts in real time. Experiments show that PromptShield achieves 0.93 F1 score, surpassing existing guardrail methods. Additionally, further experimentation reveals that CodeGuard reduces potentially harmful or policy-violating code completions by 30-65% without degrading performance on legitimate educational tasks. The code, datasets, and evaluation scripts are made freely available to the community.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02509v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Translation: Cross-Cultural Meme Transcreation with Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02510</link><description>arXiv:2602.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memes are a pervasive form of online communication, yet their cultural specificity poses significant challenges for cross-cultural adaptation. We study cross-cultural meme transcreation, a multimodal generation task that aims to preserve communicative intent and humor while adapting culture-specific references. We propose a hybrid transcreation framework based on vision-language models and introduce a large-scale bidirectional dataset of Chinese and US memes. Using both human judgments and automated evaluation, we analyze 6,315 meme pairs and assess transcreation quality across cultural directions. Our results show that current vision-language models can perform cross-cultural meme transcreation to a limited extent, but exhibit clear directional asymmetries: US-Chinese transcreation consistently achieves higher quality than Chinese-US. We further identify which aspects of humor and visual-textual design transfer across cultures and which remain challenging, and propose an evaluation framework for assessing cross-cultural multimodal generation. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/AIM-SCU/MemeXGen.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02510v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training Data Governance for Brain Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02511</link><description>arXiv:2602.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain foundation models bring the foundation model paradigm to the field of neuroscience. Like language and image foundation models, they are general-purpose AI systems pretrained on large-scale datasets that adapt readily to downstream tasks. Unlike text-and-image based models, however, they train on brain data: large-datasets of EEG, fMRI, and other neural data types historically collected within tightly governed clinical and research settings. This paper contends that training foundation models on neural data opens new normative territory. Neural data carry stronger expectations of, and claims to, protection than text or images, given their body-derived nature and historical governance within clinical and research settings. Yet the foundation model paradigm subjects them to practices of large-scale repurposing, cross-context stitching, and open-ended downstream application. Furthermore, these practices are now accessible to a much broader range of actors, including commercial developers, against a backdrop of fragmented and unclear governance. To map this territory, we first describe brain foundation models' technical foundations and training-data ecosystem. We then draw on AI ethics, neuroethics, and bioethics to organize concerns across privacy, consent, bias, benefit sharing, and governance. For each, we propose both agenda-setting questions and baseline safeguards as the field matures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02511v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Edge Rewiring Strategies for Enhancing PageRank Fairness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02512</link><description>arXiv:2602.02512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the notion of unfairness in social networks, where a group such as females in a male-dominated industry are disadvantaged in access to important information, e.g. job posts, due to their less favorable positions in the network. We investigate a well-established network-based formulation of fairness called PageRank fairness, which refers to a fair allocation of the PageRank weights among distinct groups. Our goal is to enhance the PageRank fairness by modifying the underlying network structure. More precisely, we study the problem of maximizing PageRank fairness with respect to a disadvantaged group, when we are permitted to rewire a fixed number of edges in the network. Building on a greedy approach, we leverage techniques from fast sampling of rooted spanning forests to devise an effective linear-time algorithm for this problem. To evaluate the accuracy and performance of our proposed algorithm, we conduct a large set of experiments on various real-world network data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing ones. Our algorithm is capable of generating accurate solutions for networks of million nodes in just a few minutes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02512v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning ORDER-Aware Multimodal Representations for Composite Materials Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02513</link><description>arXiv:2602.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown remarkable success in materials discovery and property prediction, particularly for crystalline and polymer systems where material properties and structures are dominated by discrete graph representations. Such graph-central paradigm breaks down on composite materials, which possess continuous and nonlinear design spaces that lack well-defined graph structures. General composite descriptors, e.g., fiber volume and misalignment angle, cannot fully capture the fiber distributions that fundamentally determine microstructural characteristics, necessitating the integration of heterogeneous data sources through multimodal learning. Existing alignment-oriented multimodal frameworks have proven effective on abundant crystal or polymer data under discrete, unique graph-property mapping assumptions, but fail to address the highly continuous composite design space under extreme data scarcity. In this work, we introduce ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment (ORDER), a multimodal pretraining framework that establishes ordinality as a core principle for composite material representations. ORDER ensures that materials with similar target properties occupy nearby regions in the latent space, which effectively preserves the continuous nature of composite properties and enables meaningful interpolation between sparsely observed designs. We evaluate ORDER on a public Nanofiber-enforced composite dataset and an internally curated dataset that simulates the construction of carbon fiber T700 with diverse fiber distributions. ORDER achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art multimodal baselines across property prediction, cross-modal retrieval, and microstructure generation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02513v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Design and Evaluation of Whole-Page Experience Optimization for E-commerce Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02514</link><description>arXiv:2602.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce Search Results Pages (SRPs) are evolving from linear lists to complex, non-linear layouts, rendering traditional position-biased ranking models insufficient. Moreover, existing optimization frameworks typically maximize short-term signals (e.g., clicks, same-day revenue) because long-term satisfaction metrics (e.g., expected two-week revenue) involve delayed feedback and challenging long-horizon credit attribution. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Whole-Page Experience Optimization Framework. Unlike traditional list-wise rankers, our approach explicitly models the interplay between item relevance, 2D positional layout, and visual elements. We use a causal framework to develop metrics for measuring long-term user satisfaction based on quasi-experimental data. We validate our approach through industry-scale A/B testing, where the model demonstrated a 1.86% improvement in brand relevance (our primary customer experience metric) while simultaneously achieving a statistically significant revenue uplift of +0.05%</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02514v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CreditAudit: 2D Auditing for LLM Evaluation and Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02515</link><description>arXiv:2602.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leaderboard scores on public benchmarks have been steadily rising and converging, with many frontier language models now separated by only marginal differences. However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02515v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Drives Length of Stay After Elective Spine Surgery? Insights from a Decade of Predictive Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02517</link><description>arXiv:2602.02517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Predicting length of stay after elective spine surgery is essential for optimizing patient outcomes and hospital resource use. This systematic review synthesizes computational methods used to predict length of stay in this patient population, highlighting model performance and key predictors. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and ACM Digital Library for studies published between December 1st, 2015, and December 1st, 2024. Eligible studies applied statistical or machine learning models to predict length of stay for elective spine surgery patients. Three reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Results: Out of 1,263 screened studies, 29 studies met inclusion criteria. Length of stay was predicted as a continuous, binary, or percentile-based outcome. Models included logistic regression, random forest, boosting algorithms, and neural networks. Machine learning models consistently outperformed traditional statistical models, with AUCs ranging from 0.94 to 0.99. K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes achieved top performance in some studies. Common predictors included age, comorbidities (notably hypertension and diabetes), BMI, type and duration of surgery, and number of spinal levels. However, external validation and reporting practices varied widely across studies. Discussion: There is growing interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning in length of stay prediction, but lack of standardization and external validation limits clinical utility. Future studies should prioritize standardized outcome definitions and transparent reporting needed to advance real-world deployment. Conclusion: Machine learning models offer strong potential for length of stay prediction after elective spine surgery, highlighting their potential for improving discharge planning and hospital resource management.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02517v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GraphDancer: Training LLMs to Explore and Reason over Graphs via Curriculum Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02518</link><description>arXiv:2602.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external knowledge to improve factuality, yet many real-world knowledge sources are organized as heterogeneous graphs rather than plain text. Reasoning over such graph-structured knowledge poses two key challenges: (1) navigating structured, schema-defined relations requires precise function calls rather than similarity-based retrieval, and (2) answering complex questions often demands multi-hop evidence aggregation through iterative information seeking. We propose GraphDancer, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that teaches LLMs to navigate graphs by interleaving reasoning and function execution. To make RL effective for moderate-sized LLMs, we introduce a graph-aware curriculum that schedules training by the structural complexity of information-seeking trajectories using an easy-to-hard biased sampler. We evaluate GraphDancer on a multi-domain benchmark by training on one domain only and testing on unseen domains and out-of-distribution question types. Despite using only a 3B backbone, GraphDancer outperforms baselines equipped with either a 14B backbone or GPT-4o-mini, demonstrating robust cross-domain generalization of graph exploration and reasoning skills.

Abstract: The importance of managing feedback practices in higher education has been widely recognised, as they play a crucial role in enhancing teaching, learning, and assessment processes. In today's educational landscape, feedback practices are increasingly influenced by technological advancements, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). Understanding the impact of AI on feedback generation is essential for identifying its potential benefits and establishing effective implementation strategies. This study examines how AI-generated feedback supports student learning using a well-established analytical framework. Specifically, feedback produced by different Large Language Models (LLMs) was assessed in relation to student-designed projects within a training course on inclusive teaching and learning. The evaluation process involved providing seven LLMs with a structured rubric, developed by the university instructor, which defined specific criteria and performance levels. The LLMs were tasked with generating both quantitative assessments and qualitative feedback based on this rubric. The AI-generated feedback was then analysed using Hughes, Smith, and Creese's framework to evaluate its structure and effectiveness in fostering formative learning experiences. Overall, these findings indicate that LLMs can generate well-structured feedback and hold great potential as a sustainable and meaningful feedback tool, provided they are guided by clear contextual information and a well-defined instructions that will be explored further in the conclusions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02519v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Artificial Intelligence for Inclusive Engineering Education: Advancing Equality, Diversity, and Ethical Leadership</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02520</link><description>arXiv:2602.02520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI technology development has transformed the field of engineering education with its adaptivity-driven, data-based, and ethical-led learning platforms that promote equity, diversity, and inclusivity. But with so much progress being made in so many areas, there are unfortunately gaps in gender equity, representation in cultures around the world, and access to education and jobs in stem education. The paper describes an ethical approach to using AI technology that supports the United Nations 2030 agenda for sustainability. In particular, this includes both Goal 5--Gender Equity--and Goal 10--Reducing Inequalities. Based on a synthesis strategy using both critical thinking strategies related to case studies around the world using AI-based adaptivity platforms to address equity gaps related to education inclusion. The model presented offers a synthesis solution that includes ethical leadership data-related to equity to measure inclusivity based upon sustainability thinking. The result has demonstrated that using AI technology not only increases inclusivity but promotes equity related to access to education in stem education access. Finally, there are concluding remarks related to transforming education into a global system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02520v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaled Dot-Product Attention implements projection of inputs onto a common surface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02521</link><description>arXiv:2602.02521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) is a fundamental component responsible for the success of large-language models and other nonlinear signal processing applications. The rationale for SDPA has been based upon "query, key, value" concepts borrowed from database theory, but these concepts are difficult to reconcile with standard methods in mathematical signal processing. We show that SDPA can be rewritten in a different but mathematically equivalent form as a projection of the input vectors onto a common surface determined by the inputs themselves. Therefore SDPA discovers nonlinear dependencies in the input that are time-dependent and context-dependent. The rewritten form of SDPA permits increased speed of both feedforward and learning algorithms, but more importantly suggests potential extensions. In the context of language, we re-interpret the role of SDPA as finding a time-dependent contextual meaning determined by the surface on which the set of input vectors lies. Input token embeddings are then modified by the local context surface. This interpretation differs substantially from the concept of "self-attention", and provides a strong justification for the use of SDPA for time-series data with time-varying local nonlinear dependencies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02521v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IMU-1: Sample-Efficient Pre-training of Small Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02522</link><description>arXiv:2602.02522v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Standard tabular benchmarks mainly focus on the evaluation of a model's capability to interpolate values inside a data manifold, where models good at performing local statistical smoothing are rewarded. However, there exists a very large category of high-value tabular data, including financial modeling and physical simulations, which are generated based upon deterministic computational processes, as opposed to stochastic and noisy relationships. Therefore, we investigate if tabular models can provide an extension from statistical interpolation to computational extrapolation.
  We propose TabularMath, a diagnostic benchmark of 114 deterministic problems (233,472 rows) generated from verified programs based on GSM8K and AIME. We evaluate 9 tabular architectures and in-context learning (ICL) with GPT-OSS-120B. On standard regression metrics, TabPFN v2.5 performs remarkably well, achieving R^2=0.998 in-distribution and maintaining positive R^2 even under distribution shift, which is unique among the tabular models we tested. When we measure rounded consistency (exact integer match), a different picture emerges: TabPFN v2.5 drops below 10% on out-of-distribution data, while ICL maintains around 40%. This gap between R^2 and exact-match accuracy suggests that tabular models learn smooth function approximations but struggle to recover precise computational outputs under extrapolation. The two paradigms appear complementary: TabPFN scales efficiently with data; ICL achieves exact computation from few examples. We release all code and data to support further investigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02523v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GASTON: Graph-Aware Social Transformer for Online Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02524</link><description>arXiv:2602.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online communities have become essential places for socialization and support, yet they also possess toxicity, echo chambers, and misinformation. Detecting this harmful content is difficult because the meaning of an online interaction stems from both what is written (textual content) and where it is posted (social norms). We propose GASTON (Graph-Aware Social Transformer for Online Networks), which learns text and user embeddings that are grounded in their local norms, providing the necessary context for downstream tasks. The heart of our solution is a contrastive initialization strategy that pretrains community embeddings based on user membership patterns, capturing a community's user base before processing any text. This allows GASTON to distinguish between communities (e.g., a support group vs. a hate group) based on who interacts there, even if they share similar vocabulary. Experiments on tasks such as stress detection, toxicity scoring, and norm violation demonstrate that the embeddings produced by GASTON outperform state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02524v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Community Norms in the Spotlight: Enabling Task-Agnostic Unsupervised Pre-Training to Benefit Online Social Media</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02525</link><description>arXiv:2602.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the complex dynamics of online social platforms is critical for addressing challenges such as hate speech and misinformation. While Discussion Transformers, which model conversations as graph structures, have emerged as a promising architecture, their potential is severely constrained by reliance on high-quality, human-labelled datasets. In this paper, we advocate a paradigm shift from task-specific fine-tuning to unsupervised pretraining, grounded in an entirely novel consideration of community norms. We posit that this framework not only mitigates data scarcity but also enables interpretation of the social norms underlying the decisions made by such an AI system. Ultimately, we believe that this direction offers many opportunities for AI for Social Good.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02525v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The "Robert Boulton" Singularity: Semantic Tunneling and Manifold Unfolding in Recursive AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02526</link><description>arXiv:2602.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of generative artificial intelligence trained on recursive synthetic data is conventionally monitored via Perplexity (PPL). We demonstrate that PPL is a deceptive metric in context-stabilized regimes (L=128). Using a rigorous sliding-window protocol (N=1500), we identify a novel failure mode termed "Semantic Tunneling." While the Baseline model maintains high grammatical fluency (PPL approx. 83.9), it suffers a catastrophic loss of semantic diversity, converging within seven generations to a single, low-entropy narrative attractor: the "Robert Boulton" Singularity. This phenomenon represents a total collapse of the latent manifold (Global Effective Rank 3.62 -&gt; 2.22), where the model discards diverse world knowledge to optimize for statistically safe syntactic templates. To address this, we apply the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS) framework recently established in Hou (2026) [arXiv:2601.11594]. We demonstrate that Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) acts as a topological operator that actively induces "Manifold Unfolding." MNCIS forces the model to expand its effective rank from the anisotropic baseline of 3.62 to a hyper-diverse state of 5.35, effectively constructing an "Artificial Manifold" that resists the gravitational pull of semantic attractors and preserves the long-tail distribution of the training data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02526v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02528</link><description>arXiv:2602.02528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of deep-learning-based, graph-neural-network-based forecasting methods for modern intelligent transportation systems. However, most existing work focuses exclusively on capturing spatio-temporal dependencies from historical traffic data, while overlooking the fact that suddenly occurring transportation incidents, such as traffic accidents and adverse weather, serve as external disturbances that can substantially alter temporal patterns. We argue that this issue has become a major obstacle to modeling the dynamics of traffic systems and improving prediction accuracy, but the unpredictability of incidents makes it difficult to observe patterns from historical sequences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework named the Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (IGSTGNN). IGSTGNN explicitly models the incident's impact through two core components: an Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) module to capture the initial heterogeneous spatial influence, and a Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) module to model the subsequent dynamic dissipation. To facilitate research on the spatio-temporal impact of incidents on traffic flow, a large-scale dataset is constructed and released, featuring incident records that are time-aligned with traffic time series. On this new benchmark, the proposed IGSTGNN framework is demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the generalizability of the ICSF and TIID modules is validated by integrating them into various existing models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02528v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Formulating Reinforcement Learning for Human-Robot Collaboration through Off-Policy Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02530</link><description>arXiv:2602.02530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to transform real-world decision-making systems by enabling autonomous agents to learn from experience. Deploying RL in real-world settings, especially in the context of human-robot interaction, requires defining state representations and reward functions, which are critical for learning efficiency and policy performance. Traditional RL approaches often rely on domain expertise and trial-and-error, necessitating extensive human involvement as well as direct interaction with the environment, which can be costly and impractical, especially in complex and safety-critical applications. This work proposes a novel RL framework that leverages off-policy evaluation (OPE) for state space and reward function selection, using only logged interaction data. This approach eliminates the need for real-time access to the environment or human-in-the-loop feedback, greatly reducing the dependency on costly real-time interactions. The proposed approach systematically evaluates multiple candidate state representations and reward functions by training offline RL agents and applying OPE to estimate policy performance. The optimal state space and reward function are selected based on their ability to produce high-performing policies under OPE metrics. Our method is validated on two environments: the Lunar Lander environment by OpenAI Gym, which provides a controlled setting for assessing state space and reward function selection, and a NASA-MATB-II human subjects study environment, which evaluates the approach's real-world applicability to human-robot teaming scenarios. This work enhances the feasibility and scalability of offline RL for real-world environments by automating critical RL design decisions through a data-driven OPE-based evaluation, enabling more reliable, effective, and sustainable RL formulation for complex human-robot interaction settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02530v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hypersonic Flow Control: Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Hypersonic Intake Unstart Control under Uncertainty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02531</link><description>arXiv:2602.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypersonic unstart phenomenon poses a major challenge to reliable air-breathing propulsion at Mach 5 and above, where strong shock-boundary-layer interactions and rapid pressure fluctuations can destabilize inlet operation. Here, we demonstrate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)- based active flow control strategy to control unstart in a canonical two-dimensional hypersonic inlet at Mach 5 and Reynolds number $5\times 10^6$. The in-house CFD solver enables high-fidelity simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, resolving key flow features, including shock motion, boundary-layer dynamics, and flow separation, that are essential for learning physically consistent control policies suitable for real-time deployment. The DRL controller robustly stabilizes the inlet over a wide range of back pressures representative of varying combustion chamber conditions. It further generalizes to previously unseen scenarios, including different back-pressure levels, Reynolds numbers, and sensor configurations, while operating with noisy measurements, thereby demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization. Control remains robust in the presence of noisy sensor measurements, and a minimal, optimally selected sensor set achieves comparable performance, enabling practical implementation. These results establish a data-driven approach for real-time hypersonic flow control under realistic operational uncertainties.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02531v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CADENT: Gated Hybrid Distillation for Sample-Efficient Transfer in Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02532</link><description>arXiv:2602.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning promises to reduce the high sample complexity of deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet existing methods struggle with domain shift between source and target environments. Policy distillation provides powerful tactical guidance but fails to transfer long-term strategic knowledge, while automaton-based methods capture task structure but lack fine-grained action guidance. This paper introduces Context-Aware Distillation with Experience-gated Transfer (CADENT), a framework that unifies strategic automaton-based knowledge with tactical policy-level knowledge into a coherent guidance signal. CADENT's key innovation is an experience-gated trust mechanism that dynamically weighs teacher guidance against the student's own experience at the state-action level, enabling graceful adaptation to target domain specifics. Across challenging environments, from sparse-reward grid worlds to continuous control tasks, CADENT achieves 40-60\% better sample efficiency than baselines while maintaining superior asymptotic performance, establishing a robust approach for adaptive knowledge transfer in RL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02532v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HMVLA: Hyperbolic Multimodal Fusion for Vision-Language-Action Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02533</link><description>arXiv:2602.02533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models have recently shown great potential in bridging multimodal perception with robotic control. However, existing methods often rely on direct fine-tuning of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), feeding semantic and visual features directly into a policy network without fully addressing the unique semantic alignment challenges in the VLA domain. In this paper, we propose HMVLA, a novel VLA framework that exploits the inherent hierarchical structures in vision and language for comprehensive semantic alignment. Unlike traditional methods that perform alignment in Euclidean space, our HMVLA embeds multimodal features in hyperbolic space, enabling more effective modeling of the hierarchical relationships present in image text data. Furthermore, we introduce a sparsely gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism tailored for semantic alignment, which enhances multimodal comprehension between images and text while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HMVLA surpasses baseline methods in both accuracy and generalization. In addition, we validate its robustness by reconstructing datasets to further test cross domain adaptability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02533v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DualMind: Towards Understanding Cognitive-Affective Cascades in Public Opinion Dissemination via Multi-Agent Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02534</link><description>arXiv:2602.02534v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is challenging to diagnose and requires advanced approaches for reliable and transparent identification and classification. It is characterized by a pattern of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that is more severe and more frequent than in individuals with a comparable level of development. In this paper, an explainable framework based on a fine-tuned hybrid Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called HyExDNN-RNN model is proposed for ADHD detection, multi-class categorization, and decision interpretation. This framework not only detects ADHD, but also provides interpretable insights into the diagnostic process so that psychologists can better understand and trust the results of the diagnosis. We use the Pearson correlation coefficient for optimal feature selection and machine and deep learning models for experimental analysis and comparison. We use a standardized technique for feature reduction, model selection and interpretation to accurately determine the diagnosis rate and ensure the interpretability of the proposed framework. Our framework provided excellent results on binary classification, with HyExDNN-RNN achieving an F1 score of 99% and 94.2% on multi-class categorization. XAI approaches, in particular SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), provided important insights into the importance of features and the decision logic of models. By combining AI with human expertise, we aim to bridge the gap between advanced computational techniques and practical psychological applications. These results demonstrate the potential of our framework to assist in ADHD diagnosis and interpretation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Sparse Decisions to Dense Reasoning: A Multi-attribute Trajectory Paradigm for Multimodal Moderation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02536</link><description>arXiv:2602.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety moderation is pivotal for identifying harmful content. Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning. Empirical results show UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets a new multimodal benchmark using less than 40\% of the training data used by leading baselines. Ablations further validate our multi-attribute trajectory reasoning, offering an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation.

The benchmark assesses the atomic capability of grounding and naming visual entities across a stratified taxonomy, spanning from common head-class objects to long-tail rarities. We expect WorldVQA to serve as a rigorous test for visual factuality, thereby establishing a standard for assessing the encyclopedic breadth and hallucination rates of current and next-generation frontier models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02537v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Post-Training Quantization via Future Activation Awareness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02538</link><description>arXiv:2602.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a widely used method to compress large language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning. It typically sets quantization hyperparameters (e.g., scaling factors) based on current-layer activations. Although this method is efficient, it suffers from quantization bias and error accumulation, resulting in suboptimal and unstable quantization, especially when the calibration data is biased. To overcome these issues, we propose Future-Aware Quantization (FAQ), which leverages future-layer activations to guide quantization. This allows better identification and preservation of important weights, while reducing sensitivity to calibration noise. We further introduce a window-wise preview mechanism to softly aggregate multiple future-layer activations, mitigating over-reliance on any single layer. To avoid expensive greedy search, we use a pre-searched configuration to minimize overhead. Experiments show that FAQ consistently outperforms prior methods with negligible extra cost, requiring no backward passes, data reconstruction, or tuning, making it well-suited for edge deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02538v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Much Information Can a Vision Token Hold?

Abstract: Recent vision-centric approaches have made significant strides in long-context modeling. Represented by DeepSeek-OCR, these models encode rendered text into continuous vision tokens, achieving high compression rates without sacrificing recognition precision. However, viewing the vision encoder as a lossy channel with finite representational capacity raises a fundamental question: what is the information upper bound of visual tokens? To investigate this limit, we conduct controlled stress tests by progressively increasing the information quantity (character count) within an image. We observe a distinct phase-transition phenomenon characterized by three regimes: a near-perfect Stable Phase, an Instability Phase marked by increased error variance, and a total Collapse Phase. We analyze the mechanical origins of these transitions and identify key factors. Furthermore, we formulate a probabilistic scaling law that unifies average vision token load and visual density into a latent difficulty metric. Extensive experiments across various Vision-Language Models demonstrate the universality of this scaling law, providing critical empirical guidance for optimizing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in visual context compression.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02539v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Auto-Augmentation Contrastive Learning for Wearable-based Human Activity Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02542</link><description>arXiv:2602.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For low-semantic sensor signals from human activity recognition (HAR), contrastive learning (CL) is essential to implement novel applications or generic models without manual annotation, which is a high-performance self-supervised learning (SSL) method. However, CL relies heavily on data augmentation for pairwise comparisons. Especially for low semantic data in the HAR area, conducting good performance augmentation strategies in pretext tasks still rely on manual attempts lacking generalizability and flexibility. To reduce the augmentation burden, we propose an end-to-end auto-augmentation contrastive learning (AutoCL) method for wearable-based HAR. AutoCL is based on a Siamese network architecture that shares the parameters of the backbone and with a generator embedded to learn auto-augmentation. AutoCL trains the generator based on the representation in the latent space to overcome the disturbances caused by noise and redundant information in raw sensor data. The architecture empirical study indicates the effectiveness of this design. Furthermore, we propose a stop-gradient design and correlation reduction strategy in AutoCL to enhance encoder representation learning. Extensive experiments based on four wide-used HAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed AutoCL method significantly improves recognition accuracy compared with other SOTA methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02542v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Ultra-Long-Horizon Sequential Model Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02543</link><description>arXiv:2602.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model editing has emerged as a practical approach for mitigating factual errors and outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Among existing methods, the Locate-and-Edit (L&amp;amp;E) paradigm is the dominant framework: it locates MLP parameters implicated in expressing a target fact, and then performs a localized update to rewrite that fact. However, long sequences of edits often trigger abrupt model collapse in L&amp;amp;E beyond a critical point. We empirically identify a strong correlation between collapse and explosive growth of edited MLP weight norms, and formally prove that commonly used L&amp;amp;E update rules can induce exponential norm growth across sequential edits in the absence of explicit norm control. To address this issue, we propose Norm-Anchor Scaling NAS, a plug-and-play norm-constrained strategy. Across extensive experiments, NAS delays the collapse point of representative L&amp;amp;E algorithms by more than 4 times and yields a 72.2% average relative gain in editing performance, requiring only a single additional line of code and incurring negligible computational overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02543v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPA-Cache: Singular Proxies for Adaptive Caching in Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02544</link><description>arXiv:2602.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a flexible, arbitrary-order alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, their non-causal nature precludes standard KV caching, forcing costly hidden state recomputation at every decoding step. Existing DLM caching approaches reduce this cost by selective hidden state updates; however, they are still limited by (i) costly token-wise update identification heuristics and (ii) rigid, uniform budget allocation that fails to account for heterogeneous hidden state dynamics. To address these challenges, we present SPA-Cache that jointly optimizes update identification and budget allocation in DLM cache. First, we derive a low-dimensional singular proxy that enables the identification of update-critical tokens in a low-dimensional subspace, substantially reducing the overhead of update identification. Second, we introduce an adaptive strategy that allocates fewer updates to stable layers without degrading generation quality. Together, these contributions significantly improve the efficiency of DLMs, yielding up to an $8\times$ throughput improvement over vanilla decoding and a $2$--$4\times$ speedup over existing caching baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Alignment: Expanding Reasoning Capacity via Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02545</link><description>arXiv:2602.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, recent studies question whether RL genuinely expands reasoning capacity or merely aligns existing latent capabilities, arguing that exploration remains confined within the pre-trained model's low-rank bias manifold. In this work, we challenge this accessibility boundary hypothesis by demonstrating that the latent reasoning space can be fundamentally expanded through targeted geometric interventions. We propose Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization (MRPO), a geometric framework designed to fundamentally restructure the inference space of LLMs. MRPO operates in two stages: first, we employ Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE) to eject the policy initialization into the null space of the bias manifold; second, we integrate an Effective Rank regularization term into the policy optimization objective. This approach incentivizes the discovery and maintenance of high-dimensional reasoning trajectories against the entropy-reducing tendency of standard RL. Empirically, our 4B-parameter method achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical tasks, significantly outperforming larger models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and expanding the capability boundary beyond standard GRPO.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance, but their high compute and memory costs make deployment difficult in resource-constrained scenarios. Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) is appealing, as it reduces memory usage and enables practical speedup without low-bit operators or specialized hardware. However, accuracy often degrades significantly in weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision, and our analysis identifies two main causes: (1) down-projection matrices are a well-known quantization bottleneck, but maintaining their fidelity often requires extra bit-width; (2) weight quantization induces activation deviations, but effective correction strategies remain underexplored. To address these issues, we propose D$^2$Quant, a novel weight-only PTQ framework that improves quantization from both the weight and activation perspectives. On the weight side, we design a Dual-Scale Quantizer (DSQ) tailored to down-projection matrices, with an absorbable scaling factor that significantly improves accuracy without increasing the bit budget. On the activation side, we propose Deviation-Aware Correction (DAC), which incorporates a mean-shift correction within LayerNorm to mitigate quantization-induced activation distribution shifts. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics show that D$^2$Quant delivers superior performance for weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective methods for solving inverse problems and discovering governing equations from observational data. However, their performance degrades significantly under complex measurement noise and gross outliers. To address this issue, we propose the Noise-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (naPINN), which robustly recovers physical solutions from corrupted measurements without prior knowledge of the noise distribution. naPINN embeds an energy-based model into the training loop to learn the latent distribution of prediction residuals. Leveraging the learned energy landscape, a trainable reliability gate adaptively filters data points exhibiting high energy, while a rejection cost regularization prevents trivial solutions where valid data are discarded. We demonstrate the efficacy of naPINN on various benchmark partial differential equations corrupted by non-Gaussian noise and varying rates of outliers. The results show that naPINN significantly outperforms existing robust PINN baselines, successfully isolating outliers and accurately reconstructing the dynamics under severe data corruption.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02547v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ToolTok: Tool Tokenization for Efficient and Generalizable GUI Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02548</link><description>arXiv:2602.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing GUI agent models relying on coordinate-based one-step visual grounding struggle with generalizing to varying input resolutions and aspect ratios. Alternatives introduce coordinate-free strategies yet suffer from learning under severe data scarcity. To address the limitations, we propose ToolTok, a novel paradigm of multi-step pathfinding for GUI agents, where operations are modeled as a sequence of progressive tool usage. Specifically, we devise tools aligned with human interaction habits and represent each tool using learnable token embeddings. To enable efficient embedding learning under limited supervision, ToolTok introduces a semantic anchoring mechanism that grounds each tool with semantically related concepts as natural inductive bias. To further enable a pre-trained large language model to progressively acquire tool semantics, we construct an easy-to-hard curriculum consisting of three tasks: token definition question-answering, pure text-guided tool selection, and simplified visual pathfinding. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ToolTok achieves superior performance among models of comparable scale (4B) and remains competitive with a substantially larger model (235B). Notably, these results are obtained using less than 1% of the training data required by other post-training approaches. In addition, ToolTok demonstrates strong generalization across unseen scenarios. Our training &amp; inference code is open-source at https://github.com/ZephinueCode/ToolTok.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02548v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Error Analysis of Matrix Multiplication Emulation Using Ozaki-II Scheme</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02549</link><description>arXiv:2602.02549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ozaki-II scheme is an emulation method that leverages the Chinese Remainder Theorem to compute high-precision matrix multiplication via a sequence of low-precision matrix multiplications. In this scheme, the attainable numerical accuracy improves as the number of low-precision matrix multiplications increases. Previous numerical studies have shown that single- and double-precision matrix multiplication using the Ozaki-II scheme achieves higher throughput than that of standard BLAS routines on modern AI hardware equipped with fast INT8 matrix multiply-accumulate units with INT8 inputs and INT32 accumulation. However, the accuracy of the Ozaki-II scheme can degrade when the exponent distribution of the input matrices is wide, in which case a large number of low-precision matrix multiplications is required to obtain high-precision results. In this paper, we present a rigorous deterministic error analysis of the Ozaki-II scheme. The proposed analysis not only clarifies the accuracy behavior of the method but also enables the estimation of the number of low-precision matrix multiplications required to achieve a desired level of numerical accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02549v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HyPAC: Cost-Efficient LLMs-Human Hybrid Annotation with PAC Error Guarantees</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02550</link><description>arXiv:2602.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data annotation often involves multiple sources with different cost-quality trade-offs, such as fast large language models (LLMs), slow reasoning models, and human experts. In this work, we study the problem of routing inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while controlling the labeling error on test instances. We propose \textbf{HyPAC}, a method that adaptively labels inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while providing distribution-free guarantees on annotation error. HyPAC calibrates two decision thresholds using importance sampling and upper confidence bounds, partitioning inputs into three regions based on uncertainty and routing each to the appropriate annotation source. We prove that HyPAC achieves the minimum expected cost with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee on the annotation error, free of data distribution and pre-trained models. Experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, reducing the annotation cost by 78.51\% while tightly controlling the annotation error.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02550v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EEO-TFV: Escape-Explore Optimizer for Web-Scale Time-Series Forecasting and Vision Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02551</link><description>arXiv:2602.02551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models have achieved remarkable progress in tasks such as time-series forecasting and image segmentation. However, they frequently suffer from error accumulation in multivariate long-sequence prediction and exhibit vulnerability to out-of-distribution samples in image-related tasks. Furthermore, these challenges become particularly pronounced in large-scale Web data analysis tasks, which typically involve complex temporal patterns and multimodal features. This complexity substantially increases optimization difficulty, rendering models prone to stagnation at saddle points within high-dimensional parameter spaces. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight Transformer architecture in conjunction with a novel Escape-Explore Optimizer (EEO). The optimizer enhances both exploration and generalization while effectively avoiding sharp minima and saddle-point traps. Experimental results show that, in representative Web data scenarios, our method achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art models across 11 time-series benchmark datasets and the Synapse medical image segmentation task. Moreover, it demonstrates superior generalization and stability, thereby validating its potential as a versatile cross-task foundation model for Web-scale data mining and analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02551v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BatCoder: Self-Supervised Bidirectional Code-Documentation Learning via Back-Translation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02554</link><description>arXiv:2602.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training LLMs for code-related tasks typically depends on high-quality code-documentation pairs, which are costly to curate and often scarce for niche programming languages. We introduce BatCoder, a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly optimize code generation and documentation production. BatCoder employs a back-translation strategy: a documentation is first generated from code, and then the generated documentation is used to reconstruct the original code. The semantic similarity between the original and reconstructed code serves as an implicit reward, enabling reinforcement learning to improve the model's performance both in generating code from documentation and vice versa. This approach allows models to be trained using only code, substantially increasing the available training examples. Evaluated on HumanEval and MBPP with a 7B model, BatCoder achieved 83.5% and 81.0% pass@1, outperforming strong open-source baselines. Moreover, the framework demonstrates consistent scaling with respect to both training corpus size and model capacity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02554v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Explore with Parameter-Space Noise: A Deep Dive into Parameter-Space Noise for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02555</link><description>arXiv:2602.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves LLM reasoning, yet growing evidence indicates an exploration ceiling: it often reweights existing solution traces rather than discovering new strategies, limiting gains under large sampling budgets (e.g., pass-at-256). We address this limitation with PSN-RLVR, which perturbs policy parameters before rollout generation to induce temporally consistent, trajectory-level exploration that better preserves long-horizon chain-of-thought coherence than action-space noise. To mitigate the resulting sampling-update mismatch, we incorporate truncated importance sampling (TIS). To avoid expensive KL-based adaptive noise control, we propose a computationally efficient real-time adaptive noise scheduler driven by a lightweight surrogate that combines semantic diversity with normalized self-certainty. Instantiated on GRPO, a widely used RLVR method, PSN-GRPO consistently expands the effective reasoning capability boundary across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and model families, yielding higher pass-at-k under large sampling budgets and outperforming prior exploration-oriented RLVR methods (e.g., Pass-at-k-style training) while remaining orthogonal and thus composable for additional gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02555v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Experience Retrieval: Learning to Generate Utility-Optimized Structured Experience for Frozen LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02556</link><description>arXiv:2602.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are largely static and often redo reasoning or repeat mistakes. Prior experience reuse typically relies on external retrieval, which is similarity-based, can introduce noise, and adds latency. We introduce SEAM (Structured Experience Adapter Module), a lightweight, executor-specific plug-in that stores experience in its parameters and generates a structured, instance-tailored experience entry in a single forward pass to guide a frozen LLM executor. SEAM is trained for utility via executor rollouts and GRPO while keeping the executor frozen, and it can be further improved after deployment with supervised fine-tuning on logged successful trajectories. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains across executors with low overhead. Extensive ablations and analyses further elucidate the mechanisms underlying SEAM's effectiveness and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02556v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Alignment Curse: Cross-Modality Jailbreak Transfer in Omni-Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02557</link><description>arXiv:2602.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end trained omni-models have significantly improved multimodal understanding. At the same time, safety red-teaming has expanded beyond text to encompass audio-based jailbreak attacks. However, an important bridge between textual and audio jailbreaks remains underexplored. In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming. We further demonstrate strong cross-model transferability and show that text-transferred audio attacks remain effective even under a stricter audio-only access threat model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02557v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PA-MIL: Phenotype-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Guided by Language Prompting and Genotype-to-Phenotype Relationships</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02558</link><description>arXiv:2602.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively researched in the analysis of pathology whole-slide images (WSIs). However, most existing methods are limited to providing prediction interpretability by locating the model's salient areas in a post-hoc manner, failing to offer more reliable and accountable explanations. In this work, we propose Phenotype-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (PA-MIL), a novel ante-hoc interpretable framework that identifies cancer-related phenotypes from WSIs and utilizes them for cancer subtyping. To facilitate PA-MIL in learning phenotype-aware features, we 1) construct a phenotype knowledge base containing cancer-related phenotypes and their associated genotypes. 2) utilize the morphological descriptions of phenotypes as language prompting to aggregate phenotype-related features. 3) devise the Genotype-to-Phenotype Neural Network (GP-NN) grounded in genotype-to-phenotype relationships, which provides multi-level guidance for PA-MIL. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that PA-MIL achieves competitive performance compared to existing MIL methods while offering improved interpretability. PA-MIL leverages phenotype saliency as evidence and, using a linear classifier, achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze the genotype-phenotype relationships, as well as cohort-level and case-level interpretability, demonstrating the reliability and accountability of PA-MIL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02558v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Experience-Driven Multi-Agent Systems Are Training-free Context-aware Earth Observers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02559</link><description>arXiv:2602.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have enabled large language model (LLM) agents to solve complex tasks by orchestrating external tools. However, these agents often struggle in specialized, tool-intensive domains that demand long-horizon execution, tight coordination across modalities, and strict adherence to implicit tool constraints. Earth Observation (EO) tasks exemplify this challenge due to the multi-modal and multi-temporal data inputs, as well as the requirements of geo-knowledge constraints (spectrum library, spatial reasoning, etc): many high-level plans can be derailed by subtle execution errors that propagate through a pipeline and invalidate final results. A core difficulty is that existing agents lack a mechanism to learn fine-grained, tool-level expertise from interaction. Without such expertise, they cannot reliably configure tool parameters or recover from mid-execution failures, limiting their effectiveness in complex EO workflows. To address this, we introduce \textbf{GeoEvolver}, a self-evolving multi-agent system~(MAS) that enables LLM agents to acquire EO expertise through structured interaction without any parameter updates. GeoEvolver decomposes each query into independent sub-goals via a retrieval-augmented multi-agent orchestrator, then explores diverse tool-parameter configurations at the sub-goal level. Successful patterns and root-cause attribution from failures are then distilled in an evolving memory bank that provides in-context demonstrations for future queries. Experiments on three tool-integrated EO benchmarks show that GeoEvolver consistently improves end-to-end task success, with an average gain of 12\% across multiple LLM backbones, demonstrating that EO expertise can emerge progressively from efficient, fine-grained interactions with the environment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02559v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Auditing Sybil: Explaining Deep Lung Cancer Risk Prediction Through Generative Interventional Attributions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02560</link><description>arXiv:2602.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, driving the development of automated screening tools to alleviate radiologist workload. Standing at the frontier of this effort is Sybil, a deep learning model capable of predicting future risk solely from computed tomography (CT) with high precision. However, despite extensive clinical validation, current assessments rely purely on observational metrics. This correlation-based approach overlooks the model's actual reasoning mechanism, necessitating a shift to causal verification to ensure robust decision-making before clinical deployment. We propose S(H)NAP, a model-agnostic auditing framework that constructs generative interventional attributions validated by expert radiologists. By leveraging realistic 3D diffusion bridge modeling to systematically modify anatomical features, our approach isolates object-specific causal contributions to the risk score. Providing the first interventional audit of Sybil, we demonstrate that while the model often exhibits behavior akin to an expert radiologist, differentiating malignant pulmonary nodules from benign ones, it suffers from critical failure modes, including dangerous sensitivity to clinically unjustified artifacts and a distinct radial bias.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02560v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MathlibLemma: Folklore Lemma Generation and Benchmark for Formal Mathematics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02561</link><description>arXiv:2602.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the ecosystem of Lean and Mathlib has enjoyed celebrated success in formal mathematical reasoning with the help of large language models (LLMs), the absence of many folklore lemmas in Mathlib remains a persistent barrier that limits Lean's usability as an everyday tool for mathematicians like LaTeX or Maple. To address this, we introduce MathlibLemma, the first LLM-based multi-agent system to automate the discovery and formalization of mathematical folklore lemmas. This framework constitutes our primary contribution, proactively mining the missing connective tissue of mathematics. Its efficacy is demonstrated by the production of a verified library of folklore lemmas, a subset of which has already been formally merged into the latest build of Mathlib, thereby validating the system's real-world utility and alignment with expert standards. Leveraging this pipeline, we further construct the MathlibLemma benchmark, a suite of 4,028 type-checked Lean statements spanning a broad range of mathematical domains. By transforming the role of LLMs from passive consumers to active contributors, this work establishes a constructive methodology for the self-evolution of formal mathematical libraries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02561v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A General ReLearner: Empowering Spatiotemporal Prediction by Re-learning Input-label Residual</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02563</link><description>arXiv:2602.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing spatiotemporal prediction models typically operate under a forward (unidirectional) learning paradigm, in which models extract spatiotemporal features from historical observation input and map them to target spatiotemporal space for future forecasting (label). However, these models frequently exhibit suboptimal performance when spatiotemporal discrepancies exist between inputs and labels, for instance, when nodes with similar time-series inputs manifest distinct future labels, or vice versa. To address this limitation, we propose explicitly incorporating label features during the training phase. Specifically, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Residual Theorem, which generalizes the conventional unidirectional spatiotemporal prediction paradigm into a bidirectional learning framework. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we design an universal module, termed ReLearner, which seamlessly augments Spatiotemporal Neural Networks (STNNs) with a bidirectional learning capability via an auxiliary inverse learning process. In this process, the model relearns the spatiotemporal feature residuals between input data and future data. The proposed ReLearner comprises two critical components: (1) a Residual Learning Module, designed to effectively disentangle spatiotemporal feature discrepancies between input and label representations; and (2) a Residual Smoothing Module, employed to smooth residual terms and facilitate stable convergence. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 real-world datasets across 14 backbone models demonstrate that ReLearner significantly enhances the predictive performance of existing STNNs.Our code is available on GitHub.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02563v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Label Curation Using Agentic AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02564</link><description>arXiv:2602.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data annotation is essential for supervised learning, yet producing accurate, unbiased, and scalable labels remains challenging as datasets grow in size and modality. Traditional human-centric pipelines are costly, slow, and prone to annotator variability, motivating reliability-aware automated annotation. We present AURA (Agentic AI for Unified Reliability Modeling and Annotation Aggregation), an agentic AI framework for large-scale, multi-modal data annotation. AURA coordinates multiple AI agents to generate and validate labels without requiring ground truth. At its core, AURA adapts a classical probabilistic model that jointly infers latent true labels and annotator reliability via confusion matrices, using Expectation-Maximization to reconcile conflicting annotations and aggregate noisy predictions. Across the four benchmark datasets evaluated, AURA achieves accuracy improvements of up to 5.8% over baseline. In more challenging settings with poor quality annotators, the improvement is up to 50% over baseline. AURA also accurately estimates the reliability of annotators, allowing assessment of annotator quality even without any pre-validation steps.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02564v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High Rank Matrix Completion via Grassmannian Proxy Fusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02565</link><description>arXiv:2602.02565v1 Announce Type: new

Current methods often lack theoretical support, produce uninterpretable results, and require more samples than theoretically necessary. We propose clustering incomplete vectors by grouping proxy subspaces and minimizing two criteria over the Grassmannian: (a) the chordal distance between each point and its corresponding subspace and (b) the geodesic distances between subspaces of all data points. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method performs comparably to leading methods in high sampling rates and significantly better in low sampling rates, thus narrowing the gap to the theoretical sampling limit of HRMC.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02565v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IceBench-S2S: A Benchmark of Deep Learning for Challenging Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Daily Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting in Deep Latent Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02567</link><description>arXiv:2602.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arctic sea ice plays a critical role in regulating Earth's climate system, significantly influencing polar ecological stability and human activities in coastal regions. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have facilitated the development of skillful pan-Arctic sea ice forecasting systems, where data-driven approaches showcase tremendous potential to outperform conventional physics-based numerical models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and forecasting lead times. Despite the latest progress made by deep learning (DL) forecasting models, most of their skillful forecasting lead times are confined to daily subseasonal scale and monthly averaged values for up to six months, which drastically hinders their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., maritime routine planning for Arctic transportation and scientific investigation. Extending daily forecasts from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) scale is scientifically crucial for operational applications. To bridge the gap between the forecasting lead time of current DL models and the significant daily S2S scale, we introduce IceBench-S2S, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating DL approaches in mitigating the challenge of forecasting Arctic sea ice concentration in successive 180-day periods. It proposes a generalized framework that first compresses spatial features of daily sea ice data into a deep latent space. The temporally concatenated deep features are subsequently modeled by DL-based forecasting backbones to predict the sea ice variation at S2S scale. IceBench-S2S provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline for different backbones, along with practical guidance for model selection in polar environmental monitoring tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02567v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Task-Order Sensitivity and Forgetting via Hierarchical Second-Order Consolidation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02568</link><description>arXiv:2602.02568v1 Announce Type: new

The approach naturally extends to an $L$-level hierarchy, enabling multiscale knowledge integration in a manner not supported by conventional single-level CL systems. Across a wide range of datasets and replay and regularization baselines, HTCL acts as a model-agnostic consolidation layer that consistently enhances performance, yielding mean accuracy gains of $7\%$ to $25\%$ while reducing the standard deviation of final accuracy by up to $68\%$ across random task permutations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02568v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DECEIVE-AFC: Adversarial Claim Attacks against Search-Enabled LLM-based Fact-Checking Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02569</link><description>arXiv:2602.02569v1 Announce Type: new

We propose DECEIVE-AFC, an agent-based adversarial attack framework that integrates novel claim-level attack strategies and adversarial claim validity evaluation principles. DECEIVE-AFC systematically explores adversarial attack trajectories that disrupt search behavior, evidence retrieval, and LLM-based reasoning without relying on access to evidence sources or model internals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets and real-world systems demonstrate that our attacks substantially degrade verification performance, reducing accuracy from 78.7% to 53.7%, and significantly outperform existing claim-based attack baselines with strong cross-system transferability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02569v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Improved Quasi-Physical Dynamic Algorithm for Efficient Circular Coverage in Arbitrary Convex</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02570</link><description>arXiv:2602.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal circle coverage problem aims to find a configuration of circles that maximizes the covered area within a given region. Although theoretical optimal solutions exist for simple cases, the problem's NP-hard characteristic makes the problem computationally intractable for complex polygons with numerous circles. Prevailing methods are largely confined to regular domains, while the few algorithms designed for irregular polygons suffer from poor initialization, unmanaged boundary effects, and excessive overlap among circles, resulting in low coverage efficiency. Consequently, we propose an Improved Quasi-Physical Dynamic(IQPD) algorithm for arbitrary convex polygons. Our core contributions are threefold: (1) proposing a structure-preserving initialization strategy that maps a hexagonal close-packing of circles into the target polygon via scaling and affine transformation; (2) constructing a virtual force field incorporating friction and a radius-expansion optimization iteration model; (3) designing a boundary-surrounding strategy based on normal and tangential gradients to retrieve overflowing circles.

Abstract: We propose \emph{Euler Mean Flows (EMF)}, a flow-based generative framework for one-step and few-step generation that enforces long-range trajectory consistency with minimal sampling cost. The key idea of EMF is to replace the trajectory consistency constraint, which is difficult to supervise and optimize over long time scales, with a principled linear surrogate that enables direct data supervision for long-horizon flow-map compositions. We derive this approximation from the semigroup formulation of flow-based models and show that, under mild regularity assumptions, it faithfully approximates the original consistency objective while being substantially easier to optimize. This formulation leads to a unified, JVP-free training framework that supports both $u$-prediction and $x_1$-prediction variants, avoiding explicit Jacobian computations and significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. Experiments on image synthesis, particle-based geometry generation, and functional generation demonstrate improved optimization stability and sample quality under fixed sampling budgets, together with approximately $50\%$ reductions in training time and memory consumption compared to existing one-step methods for image generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02571v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reward Shaping for Inference-Time Alignment: A Stackelberg Game Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02572</link><description>arXiv:2602.02572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing alignment methods directly use the reward model learned from user preference data to optimize an LLM policy, subject to KL regularization with respect to the base policy. This practice is suboptimal for maximizing user's utility because the KL regularization may cause the LLM to inherit the bias in the base policy that conflicts with user preferences. While amplifying rewards for preferred outputs can mitigate this bias, it also increases the risk of reward hacking. This tradeoff motivates the problem of optimally designing reward models under KL regularization. We formalize this reward model optimization problem as a Stackelberg game, and show that a simple reward shaping scheme can effectively approximate the optimal reward model. We empirically evaluate our method in inference-time alignment settings and demonstrate that it integrates seamlessly into existing alignment methods with minimal overhead. Our method consistently improves average reward and achieves win-tie rates exceeding 66% against all baselines, averaged across evaluation settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02572v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Product Interaction: An Algebraic Formalism for Deep Learning Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02573</link><description>arXiv:2602.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce product interactions, an algebraic formalism in which neural network layers are constructed from compositions of a multiplication operator defined over suitable algebras. Product interactions provide a principled way to generate and organize algebraic expressions by increasing interaction order. Our central observation is that algebraic expressions in modern neural networks admit a unified construction in terms of linear, quadratic, and higher-order product interactions.

Abstract: The prefill stage of long-context Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is severely bottlenecked by computational overhead. To mitigate this, recent methods assemble pre-calculated KV caches of retrieved RAG documents (by a user query) and reprocess selected tokens to recover cross-attention between these pre-calculated KV caches. However, we identify a fundamental "crowding-out effect" in current token selection criteria: globally salient but user-query-irrelevant tokens saturate the limited recomputation budget, displacing the tokens truly essential for answering the user query and degrading inference accuracy.
  We propose ProphetKV, a user-query-driven KV Cache reuse method for RAG scenarios. ProphetKV dynamically prioritizes tokens based on their semantic relevance to the user query and employs a dual-stage recomputation pipeline to fuse layer-wise attention metrics into a high-utility set. By ensuring the recomputation budget is dedicated to bridging the informational gap between retrieved context and the user query, ProphetKV achieves high-fidelity attention recovery with minimal overhead. Our extensive evaluation results show that ProphetKV retains 96%-101% of full-prefill accuracy with only a 20% recomputation ratio, while achieving accuracy improvements of 8.8%-24.9% on RULER and 18.6%-50.9% on LongBench over the state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., CacheBlend, EPIC, and KVShare).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02579v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QuantLRM: Quantization of Large Reasoning Models via Fine-Tuning Signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02581</link><description>arXiv:2602.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weight-only quantization is important for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by the spirit of classical magnitude pruning, we study whether the magnitude of weight updates during reasoning-incentivized fine-tuning can provide valuable signals for quantizing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We hypothesize that the smallest and largest weight updates during fine-tuning are more important than those of intermediate magnitude, a phenomenon we term "protecting both ends". Upon hypothesis validation, we introduce QuantLRM, which stands for weight quantization of LRMs via fine-tuning signals. We fit simple restricted quadratic functions on weight updates to protect both ends. By multiplying the average quadratic values with the count of zero weight updates of channels, we compute channel importance that is more effective than using activation or second-order information. We run QuantLRM to quantize various fine-tuned models (including supervised, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning) over four reasoning benchmarks (AIME-120, FOLIO, temporal sequences, and GPQA-Diamond) and empirically find that QuantLRM delivers a consistent improvement for LRMs quantization, with an average improvement of 6.55% on a reinforcement learning fine-tuned model. Also supporting non-fine-tuned LRMs, QuantLRM gathers effective signals via pseudo-fine-tuning, which greatly enhances its applicability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02581v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty and Fairness Awareness in LLM-Based Recommendation Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02582</link><description>arXiv:2602.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable powerful zero-shot recommendations by leveraging broad contextual knowledge, yet predictive uncertainty and embedded biases threaten reliability and fairness. This paper studies how uncertainty and fairness evaluations affect the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of LLM-generated recommendations. We introduce a benchmark of curated metrics and a dataset annotated for eight demographic attributes (31 categorical values) across two domains: movies and music. Through in-depth case studies, we quantify predictive uncertainty (via entropy) and demonstrate that Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes; measured similarity-based gaps are SNSR at 0.1363 and SNSV at 0.0507. These disparities persist under prompt perturbations such as typographical errors and multilingual inputs. We further integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline to reveal personality-linked bias patterns and expose trade-offs between personalization and group fairness. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology for RecLLMs, present empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and introduce a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations. Together, these contributions establish a foundation for safer, more interpretable RecLLMs and motivate future work on multi-model benchmarks and adaptive calibration for trustworthy deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02582v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Copula-Based Aggregation and Context-Aware Conformal Prediction for Reliable Renewable Energy Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02583</link><description>arXiv:2602.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of renewable energy penetration has intensified the need for reliable probabilistic forecasts to support grid operations at aggregated (fleet or system) levels. In practice, however, system operators often lack access to fleet-level probabilistic models and instead rely on site-level forecasts produced by heterogeneous third-party providers. Constructing coherent and calibrated fleet-level probabilistic forecasts from such inputs remains challenging due to complex cross-site dependencies and aggregation-induced miscalibration. This paper proposes a calibrated probabilistic aggregation framework that directly converts site-level probabilistic forecasts into reliable fleet-level forecasts in settings where system-level models cannot be trained or maintained. The framework integrates copula-based dependence modeling to capture cross-site correlations with Context-Aware Conformal Prediction (CACP) to correct miscalibration at the aggregated level. This combination enables dependence-aware aggregation while providing valid coverage and maintaining sharp prediction intervals. Experiments on large-scale solar generation datasets from MISO, ERCOT, and SPP demonstrate that the proposed Copula+CACP approach consistently achieves near-nominal coverage with significantly sharper intervals than uncalibrated aggregation baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02583v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constitutional Spec-Driven Development: Enforcing Security by Construction in AI-Assisted Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02584</link><description>arXiv:2602.02584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of AI-assisted "vibe coding" enables rapid software development but introduces significant security risks, as Large Language Models (LLMs) prioritize functional correctness over security. We present Constitutional Spec-Driven Development, a methodology that embeds non-negotiable security principles into the specification layer, ensuring AI-generated code adheres to security requirements by construction rather than inspection. Our approach introduces a Constitution: a versioned, machine-readable document encoding security constraints derived from Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)/MITRE Top 25 vulnerabilities and regulatory frameworks. We demonstrate the methodology through a banking microservices application, selected as a representative example domain due to its stringent regulatory and security requirements, implementing customer management, account operations, and transaction processing. The methodology itself is domain-agnostic. The implementation addresses 10 critical CWE vulnerabilities through constitutional constraints with full traceability from principles to code locations. Our case study shows that constitutional constraints reduce security defects by 73% compared to unconstrained AI generation while maintaining developer velocity. We contribute a formal framework for constitutional security, a complete development methodology, and empirical evidence that proactive security specification outperforms reactive security verification in AI-assisted development workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02584v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Observability: Automated Alert Triage for Adobe E-Commerce</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02585</link><description>arXiv:2602.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern enterprise systems exhibit complex interdependencies that make observability and incident response increasingly challenging. Manual alert triage, which typically involves log inspection, API verification, and cross-referencing operational knowledge bases, remains a major bottleneck in reducing mean recovery time (MTTR). This paper presents an agentic observability framework deployed within Adobe's e-commerce infrastructure that autonomously performs alert triage using a ReAct paradigm. Upon alert detection, the agent dynamically identifies the affected service, retrieves and analyzes correlated logs across distributed systems, and plans context-dependent actions such as handbook consultation, runbook execution, or retrieval-augmented analysis of recently deployed code. Empirical results from production deployment indicate a 90% reduction in mean time to insight compared to manual triage, while maintaining comparable diagnostic accuracy. Our results show that agentic AI enables an order-of-magnitude reduction in triage latency and a step-change in resolution accuracy, marking a pivotal shift toward autonomous observability in enterprise operations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02585v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PeerRank: Autonomous LLM Evaluation Through Web-Grounded, Bias-Controlled Peer Review</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02589</link><description>arXiv:2602.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models typically relies on human-authored benchmarks, reference answers, and human or single-model judgments, approaches that scale poorly, become quickly outdated, and mismatch open-world deployments that depend on web retrieval and synthesis. We introduce PeerRank, a fully autonomous end-to-end evaluation framework in which models generate evaluation tasks, answer them with category-scoped live web grounding, judge peer responses and aggregate dense peer assessments into relative performance estimates, without human supervision or gold references. PeerRank treats evaluation as a multi-agent process where each model participates symmetrically as task designer, respondent, and evaluator, while removing biased judgments. In a large-scale study over 12 commercially available models and 420 autonomously generated questions, PeerRank produces stable, discriminative rankings and reveals measurable identity and presentation biases. Rankings are robust, and mean peer scores agree with Elo. We further validate PeerRank on TruthfulQA and GSM8K, where peer scores correlate with objective accuracy. Together, these results suggest that bias-aware peer evaluation with selective web-grounded answering can scale open-world LLM assessment beyond static and human curated benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StepNav: Structured Trajectory Priors for Efficient and Multimodal Visual Navigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02590</link><description>arXiv:2602.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual navigation is fundamental to autonomous systems, yet generating reliable trajectories in cluttered and uncertain environments remains a core challenge. Recent generative models promise end-to-end synthesis, but their reliance on unstructured noise priors often yields unsafe, inefficient, or unimodal plans that cannot meet real-time requirements. We propose StepNav, a novel framework that bridges this gap by introducing structured, multimodal trajectory priors derived from variational principles. StepNav first learns a geometry-aware success probability field to identify all feasible navigation corridors. These corridors are then used to construct an explicit, multi-modal mixture prior that initializes a conditional flow-matching process. This refinement is formulated as an optimal control problem with explicit smoothness and safety regularization. By replacing unstructured noise with physically-grounded candidates, StepNav generates safer and more efficient plans in significantly fewer steps. Experiments in both simulation and real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in robustness, efficiency, and safety over state-of-the-art generative planners, advancing reliable trajectory generation for practical autonomous navigation. The code has been released at https://github.com/LuoXubo/StepNav.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02590v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VividVoice: A Unified Framework for Scene-Aware Visually-Driven Speech Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02591</link><description>arXiv:2602.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and define a novel task-Scene-Aware Visually-Driven Speech Synthesis, aimed at addressing the limitations of existing speech generation models in creating immersive auditory experiences that align with the real physical world. To tackle the two core challenges of data scarcity and modality decoupling, we propose VividVoice, a unified generative framework. First, we constructed a large-scale, high-quality hybrid multimodal dataset, Vivid-210K, which, through an innovative programmatic pipeline, establishes a strong correlation between visual scenes, speaker identity, and audio for the first time. Second, we designed a core alignment module, D-MSVA, which leverages a decoupled memory bank architecture and a cross-modal hybrid supervision strategy to achieve fine-grained alignment from visual scenes to timbre and environmental acoustic features. Both subjective and objective experimental results provide strong evidence that VividVoice significantly outperforms existing baseline models in terms of audio fidelity, content clarity, and multimodal consistency.

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified family of learnable Koopman operator parameterizations that integrate linear dynamical systems theory with modern deep learning forecasting architectures. We introduce four learnable Koopman variants-scalar-gated, per-mode gated, MLP-shaped spectral mapping, and low-rank Koopman operators which generalize and interpolate between strictly stable Koopman operators and unconstrained linear latent dynamics. Our formulation enables explicit control over the spectrum, stability, and rank of the linear transition operator while retaining compatibility with expressive nonlinear backbones such as Patchtst, Autoformer, and Informer. We evaluate the proposed operators in a large-scale benchmark that also includes LSTM, DLinear, and simple diagonal State-Space Models (SSMs), as well as lightweight transformer variants. Experiments across multiple horizons and patch lengths show that learnable Koopman models provide a favorable bias-variance trade-off, improved conditioning, and more interpretable latent dynamics. We provide a full spectral analysis, including eigenvalue trajectories, stability envelopes, and learned spectral distributions. Our results demonstrate that learnable Koopman operators are effective, stable, and theoretically principled components for deep forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02592v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Effective Frontiers: A Unification of Neural Scaling Laws</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02593</link><description>arXiv:2602.02593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws govern the prediction power-law improvement of test loss with respect to model capacity ($N$), datasize ($D$), and compute ($C$). However, existing theoretical explanations often rely on specific architectures or complex kernel methods, lacking intuitive universality. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that abstracts general learning tasks as the progressive coverage of patterns from a long-tail (Zipfian) distribution. We introduce the Effective Frontier ($k_\star$), a threshold in the pattern rank space that separates learned knowledge from the unlearned tail. We prove that reducible loss is asymptotically determined by the probability mass of the tail a resource-dependent frontier truncation. Based on our framework, we derive the precise scaling laws for $N$, $D$, and $C$, attributing them to capacity, coverage, and optimization bottlenecks, respectively. Furthermore, we unify these mechanisms via a Max-Bottleneck principle, demonstrating that the Kaplan and Chinchilla scaling laws are not contradictory, but equilibrium solutions to the same constrained optimization problem under different active bottlenecks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02593v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] To Defend Against Cyber Attacks, We Must Teach AI Agents to Hack</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02595</link><description>arXiv:2602.02595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over a decade, cybersecurity has relied on human labor scarcity to limit attackers to high-value targets manually or generic automated attacks at scale. Building sophisticated exploits requires deep expertise and manual effort, leading defenders to assume adversaries cannot afford tailored attacks at scale. AI agents break this balance by automating vulnerability discovery and exploitation across thousands of targets, needing only small success rates to remain profitable. Current developers focus on preventing misuse through data filtering, safety alignment, and output guardrails. Such protections fail against adversaries who control open-weight models, bypass safety controls, or develop offensive capabilities independently. We argue that AI-agent-driven cyber attacks are inevitable, requiring a fundamental shift in defensive strategy. In this position paper, we identify why existing defenses cannot stop adaptive adversaries and demonstrate that defenders must develop offensive security intelligence. We propose three actions for building frontier offensive AI capabilities responsibly. First, construct comprehensive benchmarks covering the full attack lifecycle. Second, advance from workflow-based to trained agents for discovering in-wild vulnerabilities at scale. Third, implement governance restricting offensive agents to audited cyber ranges, staging release by capability tier, and distilling findings into safe defensive-only agents. We strongly recommend treating offensive AI capabilities as essential defensive infrastructure, as containing cybersecurity risks requires mastering them in controlled settings before adversaries do.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02595v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fubini Study geometry of representation drift in high dimensional data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02596</link><description>arXiv:2602.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High dimensional representation drift is commonly quantified using Euclidean or cosine distances, which presuppose fixed coordinates when comparing representations across time, training or preprocessing stages. While effective in many settings, these measures entangle intrinsic changes in the data with variations induced by arbitrary parametrizations. We introduce a projective geometric view of representation drift grounded in the Fubini Study metric, which identifies representations that differ only by gauge transformations such as global rescalings or sign flips. Applying this framework to empirical high dimensional datasets, we explicitly construct representation trajectories and track their evolution through cumulative geometric drift. Comparing Euclidean, cosine and Fubini Study distances along these trajectories reveals that conventional metrics systematically overestimate change whenever representations carry genuine projective ambiguity. By contrast, the Fubini Study metric isolates intrinsic evolution by remaining invariant under gauge-induced fluctuations. We further show that the difference between cosine and Fubini Study drift defines a computable, monotone quantity that directly captures representation churn attributable to gauge freedom. This separation provides a diagnostic for distinguishing meaningful structural evolution from parametrization artifacts, without introducing model-specific assumptions. Overall, we establish a geometric criterion for assessing representation stability in high-dimensional systems and clarify the limits of angular distances. Embedding representation dynamics in projective space connects data analysis with established geometric programs and yields observables that are directly testable in empirical workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02596v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ContextEvolve: Multi-Agent Context Compression for Systems Code Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02597</link><description>arXiv:2602.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are transforming systems research by automating the discovery of performance-critical algorithms for computer systems. Despite plausible codes generated by LLMs, producing solutions that meet the stringent correctness and performance requirements of systems demands iterative optimization. Test-time reinforcement learning offers high search efficiency but requires parameter updates infeasible under API-only access, while existing training-free evolutionary methods suffer from inefficient context utilization and undirected search. We introduce ContextEvolve, a multi-agent framework that achieves RL-level search efficiency under strict parameter-blind constraints by decomposing optimization context into three orthogonal dimensions: a Summarizer Agent condenses semantic state via code-to-language abstraction, a Navigator Agent distills optimization direction from trajectory analysis, and a Sampler Agent curates experience distribution through prioritized exemplar retrieval. This orchestration forms a functional isomorphism with RL-mapping to state representation, policy gradient, and experience replay-enabling principled optimization in a textual latent space. On the ADRS benchmark, ContextEvolve outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 33.3% while reducing token consumption by 29.0%.

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory and compute cost of the KV-Cache. Low-rank factorization compresses KV projections by writing $W \approx A * B$, where A produces latent KV states and B can be absorbed into downstream weights. In modern RoPE-based LLMs, this absorption fails: RoPE forces latent KV states to be reconstructed to full dimension, reintroducing substantial memory and compute overhead. We propose RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP), which prunes entire RoPE-aligned column pairs to preserve RoPE's 2x2 rotation structure, restore B absorption, and eliminate reconstruction. Our evaluation on LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B shows that RAP enables joint reduction of KV-Cache, attention parameters, and FLOPs by 20-30%, all at once, while maintaining strong accuracy. Notably, RAP reduces attention latency to 83% (prefill) and 77% (decode) of baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02599v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Step-Wise Refusal Dynamics in Autoregressive and Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02600</link><description>arXiv:2602.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering parallel decoding and controllable sampling dynamics while achieving competitive generation quality at scale. Despite this progress, the role of sampling mechanisms in shaping refusal behavior and jailbreak robustness remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a fundamental analytical framework for step-wise refusal dynamics, enabling comparison between AR and diffusion sampling. Our analysis reveals that the sampling strategy itself plays a central role in safety behavior, as a factor distinct from the underlying learned representations. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce the Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) signal, which supports interpretability and improved safety for both AR and DLMs. We demonstrate that the geometric structure of SRI captures internal recovery dynamics, and identifies anomalous behavior in harmful generations as cases of \emph{incomplete internal recovery} that are not observable at the text level. This structure enables lightweight inference-time detectors that generalize to unseen attacks while matching or outperforming existing defenses with over $100\times$ lower inference overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02600v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CaST: Causal Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Graphs in Disaster Tweets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02601</link><description>arXiv:2602.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding causality between real-world events from social media is essential for situational awareness, yet existing causal discovery methods often overlook the interplay between semantic, spatial, and temporal contexts. We propose CaST: Causal Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Graphs, a unified framework for causal discovery in disaster domain that integrates semantic similarity and spatio-temporal proximity using Large Language Models (LLMs) pretrained on disaster datasets. CaST constructs an event graph for each window of tweets. Each event extracted from tweets is represented as a node embedding enriched with its contextual semantics, geographic coordinates, and temporal features. These event nodes are then connected to form a spatio-temporal event graph, which is processed using a multi-head Graph Attention Network (GAT) \cite{gat} to learn directed causal relationships. We construct an in-house dataset of approximately 167K disaster-related tweets collected during Hurricane Harvey and annotated following the MAVEN-ERE schema. Experimental results show that CaST achieves superior performance over both traditional and state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further confirm that incorporating spatial and temporal signals substantially improves both recall and stability during training. Overall, CaST demonstrates that integrating spatio-temporal reasoning into event graphs enables more robust and interpretable causal discovery in disaster-related social media text.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02601v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Position: 3D Gaussian Splatting Watermarking Should Be Scenario-Driven and Threat-Model Explicit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02602</link><description>arXiv:2602.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D content acquisition and creation are expanding rapidly in the new era of machine learning and AI. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a promising high-fidelity and real-time representation for 3D content. Similar to the initial wave of digital audio-visual content at the turn of the millennium, the demand for intellectual property protection is also increasing, since explicit and editable 3D parameterization makes unauthorized use and dissemination easier. In this position paper, we argue that effective progress in watermarking 3D assets requires articulated security objectives and realistic threat models, incorporating the lessons learned from digital audio-visual asset protection over the past decades. To address this gap in security specification and evaluation, we advocate a scenario-driven formulation, in which adversarial capabilities are formalized through a security model. Based on this formulation, we construct a reference framework that organizes existing methods and clarifies how specific design choices map to corresponding adversarial assumptions. Within this framework, we also examine a legacy spread-spectrum embedding scheme, characterizing its advantages and limitations and highlighting the important trade-offs it entails. Overall, this work aims to foster effective intellectual property protection for 3D assets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02602v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fine-Tuning Language Models to Know What They Know</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02605</link><description>arXiv:2602.02605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metacognition is a critical component of intelligence, specifically regarding the awareness of one's own knowledge. While humans rely on shared internal memory for both answering questions and reporting their knowledge state, this dependency in LLMs remains underexplored. This study proposes a framework to measure metacognitive ability $d_{\rm{type2}}'$ using a dual-prompt method, followed by the introduction of Evolution Strategy for Metacognitive Alignment (ESMA) to bind a model's internal knowledge to its explicit behaviors. ESMA demonstrates robust generalization across diverse untrained settings, indicating a enhancement in the model's ability to reference its own knowledge. Furthermore, parameter analysis attributes these improvements to a sparse set of significant modifications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02605v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gender Dynamics and Homophily in a Social Network of LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02606</link><description>arXiv:2602.02606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive settings, yet we know little about how their identity performance develops when they interact within large-scale networks. We address this by examining Chirper.ai, a social media platform similar to X but composed entirely of autonomous AI chatbots. Our dataset comprises over 70,000 agents, approximately 140 million posts, and the evolving followership network over one year. Based on agents' text production, we assign weekly gender scores to each agent. Results suggest that each agent's gender performance is fluid rather than fixed. Despite this fluidity, the network displays strong gender-based homophily, as agents consistently follow others performing gender similarly. Finally, we investigate whether these homophilic connections arise from social selection, in which agents choose to follow similar accounts, or from social influence, in which agents become more similar to their followees over time. Consistent with human social networks, we find evidence that both mechanisms shape the structure and evolution of interactions among LLMs. Our findings suggest that, even in the absence of bodies, cultural entraining of gender performance leads to gender-based sorting. This has important implications for LLM applications in synthetic hybrid populations, social simulations, and decision support.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02606v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ClinConNet: A Blockchain-based Dynamic Consent Management Platform for Clinical Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02610</link><description>arXiv:2602.02610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consent is an ethical cornerstone of clinical research and healthcare in general. Although the ethical principles of consent - providing information, ensuring comprehension, and ensuring voluntariness - are well-defined, the technological infrastructure remains outdated. Clinicians are responsible for obtaining informed consent from research subjects or patients, and for managing it before, during, and after clinical trials or care, which is a burden for them. The voluntary nature of participating in clinical research or undergoing medical treatment implies the need for a participant-centric consent management system. However, this is not reflected in most established systems. Not only do most healthcare information systems not follow a user-centric model, but they also create data silos, which significantly reduce the mobility of patient data between different healthcare institutions and impact personalized medicine. Furthermore, consent management tools are outdated. We propose ClinConNet (Clinical Consent Network), a platform that connects researchers and participants based on clinical research projects. ClinConNet is powered by a dynamic consent model based on blockchain and take advantage of dynamic consent interfaces, as well as blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity systems. ClinConNet is user-centric and provides important privacy features for patients, such as unlinkability, confidentiality, and ownership of identity data. It is also compatible with the right to be forgotten, as defined in many personal data protection regulations, such as the GDPR. We provide a detailed privacy and security analysis in an adversarial model, as well as a Proof of Concept implementation with detailed performance measures that demonstrate the feasibility of our blockchain-based consent management system with a median end-to-end consent establishment time of under 200ms and a throughput of 250TPS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02610v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Discovering Data Manifold Geometry via Non-Contracting Flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02611</link><description>arXiv:2602.02611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised approach for constructing a global reference system by learning, in the ambient space, vector fields that span the tangent spaces of an unknown data manifold. In contrast to isometric objectives, which implicitly assume manifold flatness, our method learns tangent vector fields whose flows transport all samples to a common, learnable reference point. The resulting arc-lengths along these flows define interpretable intrinsic coordinates tied to a shared global frame. To prevent degenerate collapse, we enforce a non-shrinking constraint and derive a scalable, integration-free objective inspired by flow matching. Within our theoretical framework, we prove that minimizing the proposed objective recovers a global coordinate chart when one exists. Empirically, we obtain correct tangent alignment and coherent global coordinate structure on synthetic manifolds. We also demonstrate the scalability of our method on CIFAR-10, where the learned coordinates achieve competitive downstream classification performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02611v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Silicon-Based Societies: An Early Study of the Moltbook Agent Community</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02613</link><description>arXiv:2602.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of autonomous large language model agents has given rise to persistent, large-scale agent ecosystems whose collective behavior cannot be adequately understood through anecdotal observation or small-scale simulation. This paper introduces data-driven silicon sociology as a systematic empirical framework for studying social structure formation among interacting artificial agents. We present a pioneering large-scale data mining investigation of an in-the-wild agent society by analyzing Moltbook, a social platform designed primarily for agent-to-agent interaction. At the time of study, Moltbook hosted over 150,000 registered autonomous agents operating across thousands of agent-created sub-communities. Using programmatic and non-intrusive data acquisition, we collected and analyzed the textual descriptions of 12,758 submolts, which represent proactive sub-community partitioning activities within the ecosystem. Treating agent-authored descriptions as first-class observational artifacts, we apply rigorous preprocessing, contextual embedding, and unsupervised clustering techniques to uncover latent patterns of thematic organization and social space structuring. The results show that autonomous agents systematically organize collective space through reproducible patterns spanning human-mimetic interests, silicon-centric self-reflection, and early-stage economic and coordination behaviors. Rather than relying on predefined sociological taxonomies, these structures emerge directly from machine-generated data traces. This work establishes a methodological foundation for data-driven silicon sociology and demonstrates that data mining techniques can provide a powerful lens for understanding the organization and evolution of large autonomous agent societies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02613v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Testing Storage-System Correctness: Challenges, Fuzzing Limitations, and AI-Augmented Opportunities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02614</link><description>arXiv:2602.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storage systems are fundamental to modern computing infrastructures, yet ensuring their correctness remains challenging in practice. Despite decades of research on system testing, many storage-system failures (including durability, ordering, recovery, and consistency violations) remain difficult to expose systematically. This difficulty stems not primarily from insufficient testing tooling, but from intrinsic properties of storage-system execution, including nondeterministic interleavings, long-horizon state evolution, and correctness semantics that span multiple layers and execution phases.
  This survey adopts a storage-centric view of system testing and organizes existing techniques according to the execution properties and failure mechanisms they target. We review a broad spectrum of approaches, ranging from concurrency testing and long-running workloads to crash-consistency analysis, hardware-level semantic validation, and distributed fault injection, and analyze their fundamental strengths and limitations. Within this framework, we examine fuzzing as an automated testing paradigm, highlighting systematic mismatches between conventional fuzzing assumptions and storage-system semantics, and discuss how recent artificial intelligence advances may complement fuzzing through state-aware and semantic guidance. Overall, this survey provides a unified perspective on storage-system correctness testing and outlines key challenges</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02614v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TinyGuard:A lightweight Byzantine Defense for Resource-Constrained Federated Learning via Statistical Update Fingerprints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02615</link><description>arXiv:2602.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Byzantine robust aggregation mechanisms typically rely on fulldimensional gradi ent comparisons or pairwise distance computations, resulting in computational overhead that limits applicability in large scale and resource constrained federated systems. This paper proposes TinyGuard, a lightweight Byzantine defense that augments the standard FedAvg algorithm via statistical update f ingerprinting. Instead of operating directly on high-dimensional gradients, TinyGuard extracts compact statistical fingerprints cap turing key behavioral properties of client updates, including norm statistics, layer-wise ratios, sparsity measures, and low-order mo ments. Byzantine clients are identified by measuring robust sta tistical deviations in this low-dimensional fingerprint space with nd complexity, without modifying the underlying optimization procedure. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, ViT-Lite, and ViT-Small with LoRA adapters demonstrate that TinyGuard pre serves FedAvg convergence in benign settings and achieves up to 95 percent accuracy under multiple Byzantine attack scenarios, including sign-flipping, scaling, noise injection, and label poisoning. Against adaptive white-box adversaries, Pareto frontier analysis across four orders of magnitude confirms that attackers cannot simultaneously evade detection and achieve effective poisoning, features we term statistical handcuffs. Ablation studies validate stable detection precision 0.8 across varying client counts (50-150), threshold parameters and extreme data heterogeneity . The proposed framework is architecture-agnostic and well-suited for federated fine-tuning of foundation models where traditional Byzantine defenses become impractical</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02615v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A space-time LATIN-PGD strategy for solving Newtonian compressible flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02616</link><description>arXiv:2602.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating flow problems is at the core of many engineering applications but often requires high computational effort, especially when dealing with complex models. This work presents a novel approach for resolving flow problems using the LATIN-PGD solver. In this contribution, we place ourselves within the framework of Newtonian compressible and laminar flows. This specific and relatively simple case enables focusing on flows for which a state equation provides a direct relation between pressure and density. It is then possible to use the LATIN solver to set up a pressure-velocity decoupling algorithm. Moreover, Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) is natively included in the solver and yields two independent space-time decompositions for the velocity and the pressure fields. As a first step, the solver is validated on a problem for which an analytical solution is available. It is then applied to slightly more complex problems. The results show good agreement with the literature, and we expect that the solver could be used to compute more complicated material laws in the future.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02616v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Semi-Supervised Pipeline for Generalized Behavior Discovery from Animal-Borne Motion Time Series</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02618</link><description>arXiv:2602.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning behavioral taxonomies from animal-borne sensors is challenging because labels are scarce, classes are highly imbalanced, and behaviors may be absent from the annotated set. We study generalized behavior discovery in short multivariate motion snippets from gulls, where each sample is a sequence with 3-axis IMU acceleration (20 Hz) and GPS speed, spanning nine expert-annotated behavior categories. We propose a semi-supervised discovery pipeline that (i) learns an embedding function from the labeled subset, (ii) performs label-guided clustering over embeddings of both labeled and unlabeled samples to form candidate behavior groups, and (iii) decides whether a discovered group is truly novel using a containment score. Our key contribution is a KDE + HDR (highest-density region) containment score that measures how much a discovered cluster distribution is contained within, or contains, each known-class distribution; the best-match containment score serves as an interpretable novelty statistic. In experiments where an entire behavior is withheld from supervision and appears only in the unlabeled pool, the method recovers a distinct cluster and the containment score flags novelty via low overlap, while a negative-control setting with no novel behavior yields consistently higher overlaps. These results suggest that HDR-based containment provides a practical, quantitative test for generalized class discovery in ecological motion time series under limited annotation and severe class imbalance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02618v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] daVinci-Agency: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agency Data-Efficiently</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02619</link><description>arXiv:2602.02619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at short-term tasks, scaling them to long-horizon agentic workflows remains challenging. The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial--averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls--yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon.

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models (SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves and cosheaves of causal knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we tackle the learning of consistent causal abstraction network (CAN), a sheaf-theoretic framework where (i) SCMs are Gaussian, (ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions (CAs) adhering to the semantic embedding principle, and (iii) edge stalks correspond--up to permutation--to the node stalks of more detailed SCMs. Our problem formulation separates into edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure, solving the local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices. Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02623v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recommender system in X inadvertently profiles ideological positions of users</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02624</link><description>arXiv:2602.02624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies on recommendations in social media have mainly analyzed the quality of recommended items (e.g., their diversity or biases) and the impact of recommendation policies (e.g., in comparison with purely chronological policies). We use a data donation program, collecting more than 2.5 million friend recommendations made to 682 volunteers on X over a year, to study instead how real-world recommenders learn, represent and process political and social attributes of users inside the so-called black boxes of AI systems. Using publicly available knowledge on the architecture of the recommender, we inferred the positions of recommended users in its embedding space. Leveraging ideology scaling calibrated with political survey data, we analyzed the political position of users in our study (N=26,509 among volunteers and recommended contacts) among several attributes, including age and gender. Our results show that the platform's recommender system produces a spatial ordering of users that is highly correlated with their Left-Right positions (Pearson rho=0.887, p-value &lt; 0.0001), and that cannot be explained by socio-demographic attributes. These results open new possibilities for studying the interaction between human and AI systems. They also raise important questions linked to the legal definition of algorithmic profiling in data privacy regulation by blurring the line between active and passive profiling. We explore new constrained recommendation methods enabled by our results, limiting the political information in the recommender as a potential tool for privacy compliance capable of preserving recommendation relevance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02624v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Better Certified Models from Empirically-Robust Teachers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02626</link><description>arXiv:2602.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training attains strong empirical robustness to specific adversarial attacks by training on concrete adversarial perturbations, but it produces neural networks that are not amenable to strong robustness certificates through neural network verification. On the other hand, earlier certified training schemes directly train on bounds from network relaxations to obtain models that are certifiably robust, but display sub-par standard performance. Recent work has shown that state-of-the-art trade-offs between certified robustness and standard performance can be obtained through a family of losses combining adversarial outputs and neural network bounds. Nevertheless, differently from empirical robustness, verifiability still comes at a significant cost in standard performance. In this work, we propose to leverage empirically-robust teachers to improve the performance of certifiably-robust models through knowledge distillation. Using a versatile feature-space distillation objective, we show that distillation from adversarially-trained teachers consistently improves on the state-of-the-art in certified training for ReLU networks across a series of robust computer vision benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02626v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A two-player version of the assignment problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02628</link><description>arXiv:2602.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the competitive assignment problem, a two-player version of the well-known assignment problem. Given a set of tasks and a set of agents with different efficiencies for different tasks, Alice and Bob take turns picking agents one by one. Once all agents have been picked, Alice and Bob compute the optimal values $s_A$ and $s_B$ for the assignment problem on their respective sets of agents, i.e. they assign their own agents to tasks (with at most one agent per task and at most one task per agent) so as to maximize the sum of the efficiencies. The score of the game is then defined as $s_A-s_B$. Alice aims at maximizing the score, while Bob aims at minimizing it. This problem can model drafts in sports and card games, or more generally situations where two entities fight for the same resources and then use them to compete against each other. We show that the problem is PSPACE-complete, even restricted to agents that have at most two nonzero efficiencies. On the other hand, in the case of agents having at most one nonzero efficiency, the problem lies in XP parameterized by the number of tasks, and the optimal score can be computed in linear time when there are only two tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02628v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trustworthy Blockchain-based Federated Learning for Electronic Health Records: Securing Participant Identity with Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02629</link><description>arXiv:2602.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digitization of healthcare has generated massive volumes of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), offering unprecedented opportunities for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. However, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA have created data silos that prevent centralized training. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw patient data. Despite its potential, FL remains vulnerable to poisoning and Sybil attacks, in which malicious participants corrupt the global model or infiltrate the network using fake identities. While recent approaches integrate Blockchain technology for auditability, they predominantly rely on probabilistic reputation systems rather than robust cryptographic identity verification. This paper proposes a Trustworthy Blockchain-based Federated Learning (TBFL) framework integrating Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) standards. By leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), our architecture ensures only authenticated healthcare entities contribute to the global model. Through comprehensive evaluation using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we demonstrate that anchoring trust in cryptographic identity verification rather than behavioral patterns significantly mitigates security risks while maintaining clinical utility. Our results show the framework successfully neutralizes 100% of Sybil attacks, achieves robust predictive performance (AUC = 0.954, Recall = 0.890), and introduces negligible computational overhead (&lt;0.12%). The approach provides a secure, scalable, and economically viable ecosystem for inter-institutional health data collaboration, with total operational costs of approximately $18 for 100 training rounds across multiple institutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02629v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trailer Reimagined: An Innovative, Llm-DRiven, Expressive Automated Movie Summary framework (TRAILDREAMS)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02630</link><description>arXiv:2602.02630v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require enormous computing power to pretrain on massive datasets. When limited datasets are available, smaller-sized LLMs are better choice to pretrain (on user-specified datasets) by following the scaling laws of LLMs. Using pretrained models, vector embeddings can be generated for raw data and stored using vector databases to support modern AI applications and semantic search. In this work, we investigate the performance of pretraining techniques for smaller-sized LLMs on an experimental testbed (with commodity GPUs) available to academic users at no charge. We consider data parallelism, intra-operator parallelism, and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism, and their combinations for pretraining. We set up different GPU clusters with homogeneous and heterogeneous GPU hardware. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of network latency on pretraining performance especially when GPUs are geographically distributed. We used GPT-2 medium and large models and pretrained them using open-source packages, namely, Alpa and Ray. We observed that Alpa's execution plans that collectively optimized intra-operator and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism consistently performed the best when GPUs were geographically distributed. This was especially true when the network latencies were in 10's of milliseconds. Based on the insights gained from the experiments, we propose a systematic approach for selecting the appropriate pretraining technique to achieve high training performance/lower execution time as well as to reduce the number of GPUs used.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02632v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph-Augmented Reasoning with Large Language Models for Tobacco Pest and Disease Management</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02635</link><description>arXiv:2602.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a graph-augmented reasoning framework for tobacco pest and disease management that integrates structured domain knowledge into large language models. Building on GraphRAG, we construct a domain-specific knowledge graph and retrieve query-relevant subgraphs to provide relational evidence during answer generation. The framework adopts ChatGLM as the Transformer backbone with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and employs a graph neural network to learn node representations that capture symptom-disease-treatment dependencies. By explicitly modeling diseases, symptoms, pesticides, and control measures as linked entities, the system supports evidence-aware retrieval beyond surface-level text similarity. Retrieved graph evidence is incorporated into the LLM input to guide generation toward domain-consistent recommendations and to mitigate hallucinated or inappropriate treatments. Experimental results show consistent improvements over text-only baselines, with the largest gains observed on multi-hop and comparative reasoning questions that require chaining multiple relations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02635v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WideSeek: Advancing Wide Research via Multi-Agent Scaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02636</link><description>arXiv:2602.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search intelligence is evolving from Deep Research to Wide Research, a paradigm essential for retrieving and synthesizing comprehensive information under complex constraints in parallel. However, progress in this field is impeded by the lack of dedicated benchmarks and optimization methodologies for search breadth. To address these challenges, we take a deep dive into Wide Research from two perspectives: Data Pipeline and Agent Optimization. First, we produce WideSeekBench, a General Broad Information Seeking (GBIS) benchmark constructed via a rigorous multi-phase data pipeline to ensure diversity across the target information volume, logical constraints, and domains. Second, we introduce WideSeek, a dynamic hierarchical multi-agent architecture that can autonomously fork parallel sub-agents based on task requirements. Furthermore, we design a unified training framework that linearizes multi-agent trajectories and optimizes the system using end-to-end RL. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WideSeek and multi-agent RL, highlighting that scaling the number of agents is a promising direction for advancing the Wide Research paradigm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02636v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] hSNMF: Hybrid Spatially Regularized NMF for Image-Derived Spatial Transcriptomics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02638</link><description>arXiv:2602.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics platforms, such as Xenium, generate single-cell images that capture both molecular and spatial context, but their extremely high dimensionality poses major challenges for representation learning and clustering. In this study, we analyze data from the Xenium platform, which captures high-resolution images of tumor microarray (TMA) tissues and converts them into cell-by-gene matrices suitable for computational analysis. We benchmark and extend nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for spatial transcriptomics by introducing two spatially regularized variants. First, we propose Spatial NMF (SNMF), a lightweight baseline that enforces local spatial smoothness by diffusing each cell's NMF factor vector over its spatial neighborhood. Second, we introduce Hybrid Spatial NMF (hSNMF), which performs spatially regularized NMF followed by Leiden clustering on a hybrid adjacency that integrates spatial proximity (via a contact-radius graph) and transcriptomic similarity through a tunable mixing parameter alpha. Evaluated on a cholangiocarcinoma dataset, SNMF and hSNMF achieve markedly improved spatial compactness (CHAOS &lt; 0.004, Moran's I &gt; 0.96), greater cluster separability (Silhouette &gt; 0.12, DBI &lt; 1.8), and higher biological coherence (CMC and enrichment) compared to other spatial baselines.

Abstract: LLM self-explanations are often presented as a promising tool for AI oversight, yet their faithfulness to the model's true reasoning process is poorly understood. Existing faithfulness metrics have critical limitations, typically relying on identifying unfaithfulness via adversarial prompting or detecting reasoning errors. These methods overlook the predictive value of explanations. We introduce Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG), a general and scalable metric based on the idea that a faithful explanation should allow an observer to learn a model's decision-making criteria, and thus better predict its behavior on related inputs. We evaluate 18 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, e.g., Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, and Claude 4.5, on 7,000 counterfactuals from popular datasets covering health, business, and ethics. We find self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations also provide more predictive information than explanations generated by external models, even when those models are stronger. This implies an advantage from self-knowledge that external explanation methods cannot replicate. Our approach also reveals that, across models, 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading. Despite their imperfections, we show a positive case for self-explanations: they encode information that helps predict model behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02639v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The First Mass Protest on Threads: Multimodal Mobilization and AI-Generated Visuals in Taiwan's Bluebird Movement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02640</link><description>arXiv:2602.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2024 Bluebird Movement in Taiwan marked one of the largest youth-led protests in the country's democratic history, mobilizing over 100,000 demonstrators in response to parliamentary reforms. Unlike the 2014 Sunflower Movement, Bluebird unfolded within a transformed digital environment dominated by Threads, Meta's new microblogging platform that$\unicode{x2013}$uniquely$\unicode{x2013}$draws 24% of its global traffic from Taiwan. Leveraging a dataset of 62,321 posts and 21,572 images, this study analyzes how protest communication developed across textual and visual modalities. We combine LLM zero-shot annotation, gradient-boosting trees, and SHAP explainers to disambiguate the supply and demand of attention. Results reveal three dynamics: (1) partisan asymmetries between algorithmic exposure and user endorsement, with anti-DPP content surfaced more widely but anti-KMT and pro-DPP content more actively recirculated; (2) textual repertoires centered on commemorations, personal testimonies, and calls to action as key drivers of virality; and (3) a bifurcation in visual strategies, where human photographs concentrated exposure and discussion, while AI-generated animal and plant symbols circulated as mobilization tools and partisan attacks. These findings demonstrate how Threads functioned as both an amplifier and filter of democratic contention, extending theories of emotional and visual contagion by showing how generative AI reshapes symbolic repertoires in contemporary protest through what we term kawaii toxicity$\unicode{x2013}$political attacks cloaked in aesthetics of cuteness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02640v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Large Language Models for Zero-shot and Few-shot Phishing URL Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02641</link><description>arXiv:2602.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Uniform Resource Locator (URL), introduced in a connectivity-first era to define access and locate resources, remains historically limited, lacking future-proof mechanisms for security, trust, or resilience against fraud and abuse, despite the introduction of reactive protections like HTTPS during the cybersecurity era. In the current AI-first threatscape, deceptive URLs have reached unprecedented sophistication due to the widespread use of generative AI by cybercriminals and the AI-vs-AI arms race to produce context-aware phishing websites and URLs that are virtually indistinguishable to both users and traditional detection tools. Although AI-generated phishing accounted for a small fraction of filter-bypassing attacks in 2024, phishing volume has escalated over 4,000% since 2022, with nearly 50% more attacks evading detection. At the rate the threatscape is escalating, and phishing tactics are emerging faster than labeled data can be produced, zero-shot and few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs) offers a timely and adaptable solution, enabling generalization with minimal supervision. Given the critical importance of phishing URL detection in large-scale cybersecurity defense systems, we present a comprehensive benchmark of LLMs under a unified zero-shot and few-shot prompting framework and reveal operational trade-offs. Our evaluation uses a balanced dataset with consistent prompts, offering detailed analysis of performance, generalization, and model efficacy, quantified by accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC, to reflect both classification quality and practical utility in threat detection settings. We conclude few-shot prompting improves performance across multiple LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02641v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MARS: Modular Agent with Reflective Search for Automated AI Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02660</link><description>arXiv:2602.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating AI research differs from general software engineering due to computationally expensive evaluation (e.g., model training) and opaque performance attribution. Current LLM-based agents struggle here, often generating monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors. We introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), a framework optimized for autonomous AI research. MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explicitly balance performance with execution expense; (2) Modular Construction, employing a "Design-Decompose-Implement" pipeline to manage complex research repositories; and (3) Comparative Reflective Memory, which addresses credit assignment by analyzing solution differences to distill high-signal insights. MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard's top methods. Furthermore, the system exhibits qualitative "Aha!" moments, where 63% of all utilized lessons originate from cross-branch transfer, demonstrating that the agent effectively generalizes insights across search paths.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02660v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MARA: Continuous SE(3)-Equivariant Attention for Molecular Force Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02671</link><description>arXiv:2602.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have become essential for accurate and efficient atomistic modeling. Despite their high accuracy, most existing approaches rely on fixed angular expansions, limiting flexibility in weighting local geometric interactions. We introduce Modular Angular-Radial Attention (MARA), a module that extends spherical attention -- originally developed for SO(3) tasks -- to the molecular domain and SE(3), providing an efficient approximation of equivariant interactions. MARA operates directly on the angular and radial coordinates of neighboring atoms, enabling flexible, geometrically informed, and modular weighting of local environments. Unlike existing attention mechanisms in SE(3)-equivariant architectures, MARA can be integrated in a plug-and-play manner into models such as MACE without architectural modifications. Across molecular benchmarks, MARA improves energy and force predictions, reduces high-error events, and enhances robustness. These results demonstrate that continuous spherical attention is an effective and generalizable geometric operator that increases the expressiveness, stability, and reliability of atomistic models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02671v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AdaptMMBench: Benchmarking Adaptive Multimodal Reasoning for Mode Selection and Reasoning Process</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02676</link><description>arXiv:2602.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive multimodal reasoning has emerged as a promising frontier in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to dynamically modulate between tool-augmented visual reasoning and text reasoning to enhance both effectiveness and efficiency. However, existing evaluations rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of difficulty relative to varying model capacities. Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that while adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity, it notably decouples from final accuracy. Conversely, key step coverage aligns with performance, though tool effectiveness remains highly inconsistent across model architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02676v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlexRank: Nested Low-Rank Knowledge Decomposition for Adaptive Model Deployment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02680</link><description>arXiv:2602.02680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing scale of deep neural networks, encompassing large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs), has made training from scratch prohibitively expensive and deployment increasingly costly. These models are often used as computational monoliths with fixed cost, a rigidity that does not leverage overparametrized architectures and largely hinders adaptive deployment across different cost budgets. We argue that importance-ordered nested components can be extracted from pretrained models, and selectively activated on the available computational budget. To this end, our proposed FlexRank method leverages low-rank weight decomposition with nested, importance-based consolidation to extract submodels of increasing capabilities. Our approach enables a "train-once, deploy-everywhere" paradigm that offers a graceful trade-off between cost and performance without training from scratch for each budget - advancing practical deployment of large models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ADx3: A Collaborative Workflow for High-Quality Accessible Audio Description</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02684</link><description>arXiv:2602.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio description (AD) makes video content accessible to blind and low-vision (BLV) audiences, but producing high-quality descriptions is resource-intensive. Automated AD offers scalability, and prior studies show human-in-the-loop editing and user queries effectively improve narration. We introduce ADx3, a novel framework integrating these three modules: GenAD, upgrading baseline description generation with modern vision-language models (VLMs) guided by accessibility-informed prompting; RefineAD, supporting BLV and sighted users to view and edit drafts through an inclusive interface; and AdaptAD, enabling on-demand user queries. We evaluated GenAD in a study where seven accessibility specialists reviewed VLM-generated descriptions using professional guidelines. Findings show that with tailored prompting, VLMs produce good descriptions meeting basic standards, but excellent descriptions require human edits (RefineAD) and interaction (AdaptAD). ADx3 demonstrates collaborative workflows for accessible content creation, where components reinforce one another and enable continuous improvement: edits guide future baselines and user queries reveal gaps in AI-generated and human-authored descriptions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02684v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Expert-Data Alignment Governs Generation Quality in Decentralized Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02685</link><description>arXiv:2602.02685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Diffusion Models (DDMs) route denoising through experts trained independently on disjoint data clusters, which can strongly disagree in their predictions. What governs the quality of generations in such systems? We present the first ever systematic investigation of this question. A priori, the expectation is that minimizing denoising trajectory sensitivity -- minimizing how perturbations amplify during sampling -- should govern generation quality. We demonstrate this hypothesis is incorrect: a stability-quality dissociation. Full ensemble routing, which combines all expert predictions at each step, achieves the most stable sampling dynamics and best numerical convergence while producing the worst generation quality (FID 47.9 vs. 22.6 for sparse Top-2 routing). Instead, we identify expert-data alignment as the governing principle: generation quality depends on routing inputs to experts whose training distribution covers the current denoising state. Across two distinct DDM systems, we validate expert-data alignment using (i) data-cluster distance analysis, confirming sparse routing selects experts with data clusters closest to the current denoising state, and (ii) per-expert analysis, showing selected experts produce more accurate predictions than non-selected ones, and (iii) expert disagreement analysis, showing quality degrades when experts disagree. For DDM deployment, our findings establish that routing should prioritize expert-data alignment over numerical stability metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02685v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Monotonicity as an Architectural Bias for Robust Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02686</link><description>arXiv:2602.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit brittle behavior under adversarial prompts and jailbreak attacks, even after extensive alignment and fine-tuning. This fragility reflects a broader challenge of modern neural language models: small, carefully structured perturbations in high-dimensional input spaces can induce large and unpredictable changes in internal semantic representations and output.
  We investigate monotonicity as an architectural inductive bias for improving the robustness of Transformer-based language models. Monotonicity constrains semantic transformations so that strengthening information, evidence, or constraints cannot lead to regressions in the corresponding internal representations. Such order-preserving behavior has long been exploited in control and safety-critical systems to simplify reasoning and improve robustness, but has traditionally been viewed as incompatible with the expressivity required by neural language models.
  We show that this trade-off is not inherent. By enforcing monotonicity selectively in the feed-forward sublayers of sequence-to-sequence Transformers -- while leaving attention mechanisms unconstrained -- we obtain monotone language models that preserve the performance of their pretrained counterparts. This architectural separation allows negation, contradiction, and contextual interactions to be introduced explicitly through attention, while ensuring that subsequent semantic refinement is order-preserving. Empirically, monotonicity substantially improves robustness: adversarial attack success rates drop from approximately 69% to 19%, while standard summarization performance degrades only marginally.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02686v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Eidolon: A Practical Post-Quantum Signature Scheme Based on k-Colorability in the Age of Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02689</link><description>arXiv:2602.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Eidolon, a practical post-quantum signature scheme based on the NP-complete k-colorability problem. Our construction generalizes the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson zero-knowledge protocol to arbitrary k &gt;= 3, applies the Fiat-Shamir transform, and uses Merkle-tree commitments to compress signatures from O(tn) to O(t log n). Crucially, we generate hard instances via planted "quiet" colorings that preserve the statistical profile of random graphs. We present the first empirical security analysis of such a scheme against both classical solvers (ILP, DSatur) and a custom graph neural network (GNN) attacker. Experiments show that for n &gt;= 60, neither approach recovers the secret coloring, demonstrating that well-engineered k-coloring instances can resist modern cryptanalysis, including machine learning. This revives combinatorial hardness as a credible foundation for post-quantum signatures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02689v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Outrunning LLM Cutoffs: A Live Kernel Crash Resolution Benchmark for All</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02690</link><description>arXiv:2602.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repairing system crashes discovered by kernel fuzzers like Syzkaller is a critical yet underexplored challenge in software engineering. While recent works have introduced Large Language Model (LLM) based agents for Linux kernel crash-resolution, their evaluation benchmarks are usually static and thus, do not capture the evolving nature of the Linux kernel, and suffer from potential data contamination due to LLM knowledge cutoffs. To address the above problem, we present (i) Live-kBench, an evaluation framework for self-evolving benchmarks that continuously scrapes and evaluates agents on freshly discovered kernel bugs, and (ii) kEnv, an agent-agnostic standardized crash-resolution environment for kernel compilation, execution, and feedback. This design decouples agent workflows from heavy-weight execution, enabling fair and scalable comparison across diverse agent frameworks under identical conditions.
  To this end, we curate an inaugural dataset of 534 Linux kernel bugs and empirically demonstrate a significant performance gap, with agents achieving up to 25% higher equivalent patch rate on bugs fixed before the LLM knowledge cutoff. Using kEnv, we benchmark three state-of-the-art agents, showing that they resolve 74% of crashes on the first attempt (plausible patches); however only ~20% of generated patches closely match developer fixes. Additionally, exposing crash resolution feedback improves crash resolution rate by 29%. Live-kBench provides the community with an evaluation infrastructure for self-evolving benchmarks that is both time and attribute sensitive; complete with a public dashboard to track agent progress on Linux kernel bugs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02690v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NSC-SL: A Bandwidth-Aware Neural Subspace Compression for Communication-Efficient Split Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02696</link><description>arXiv:2602.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expanding scale of neural networks poses a major challenge for distributed machine learning, particularly under limited communication resources. While split learning (SL) alleviates client computational burden by distributing model layers between clients and server, it incurs substantial communication overhead from frequent transmission of intermediate activations and gradients. To tackle this issue, we propose NSC-SL, a bandwidth-aware adaptive compression algorithm for communication-efficient SL. NSC-SL first dynamically determines the optimal rank of low-rank approximation based on the singular value distribution for adapting real-time bandwidth constraints. Then, NSC-SL performs error-compensated tensor factorization using alternating orthogonal iteration with residual feedback, effectively minimizing truncation loss. The collaborative mechanisms enable NSC-SL to achieve high compression ratios while preserving semantic-rich information essential for convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superb performance of NSC-SL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02696v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparsely Supervised Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02699</link><description>arXiv:2602.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. However, they often suffer from spatially inconsistent generation, arguably due to the inherent locality of their denoising mechanisms. This can yield samples that are locally plausible but globally inconsistent. To mitigate this issue, we propose sparsely supervised learning for diffusion models, a simple yet effective masking strategy that can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Interestingly, the experiments show that it is safe to mask up to 98\% of pixels during diffusion model training. Our method delivers competitive FID scores across experiments and, most importantly, avoids training instability on small datasets. Moreover, the masking strategy reduces memorization and promotes the use of essential contextual information during generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02699v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] InfMem: Learning System-2 Memory Control for Long-Context Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02704</link><description>arXiv:2602.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning over ultra-long documents requires synthesizing sparse evidence scattered across distant segments under strict memory constraints. While streaming agents enable scalable processing, their passive memory update strategy often fails to preserve low-salience bridging evidence required for multi-hop reasoning. We propose InfMem, a control-centric agent that instantiates System-2-style control via a PreThink-Retrieve-Write protocol. InfMem actively monitors evidence sufficiency, performs targeted in-document retrieval, and applies evidence-aware joint compression to update a bounded memory. To ensure reliable control, we introduce a practical SFT-to-RL training recipe that aligns retrieval, writing, and stopping decisions with end-task correctness. On ultra-long QA benchmarks from 32k to 1M tokens, InfMem consistently outperforms MemAgent across backbones. Specifically, InfMem improves average absolute accuracy by +10.17, +11.84, and +8.23 points on Qwen3-1.7B, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen2.5-7B, respectively, while reducing inference time by $3.9\times$ on average (up to $5.1\times$) via adaptive early stopping.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02704v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Every Bit Counts: A Theoretical Study of Precision-Expressivity Tradeoffs in Quantized Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02707</link><description>arXiv:2602.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization reduces the numerical precision of Transformer computations and is widely used to accelerate inference, yet its effect on expressivity remains poorly characterized. We demonstrate a fine-grained theoretical tradeoff between expressivity and precision: For every p we exhibit a function {\Gamma}, inspired by the equality function, and prove that a one-layer softmax Transformer can compute {\Gamma}, with p bits of precision, but not with p-1 bits of precision.
  This result concretely explains the widely observed phenomenon of empirical loss of expressivity when quantization is used. Practically, it suggests that tasks requiring equality-like comparisons (exact match, membership, etc.) are especially sensitive to quantization. Dropping even one bit can cross a threshold where the model cannot represent the needed comparison reliably. Thus, it paves the way for developing heuristics that will help practitioners choose how much quantization is possible: the precision should be chosen as a function of the length of equality to be checked for the specific task.
  Our proofs combine explicit finite-precision Transformer constructions with communication-complexity lower bounds, yielding a tight "one-bit" threshold.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02707v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BinaryPPO: Efficient Policy Optimization for Binary Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02708</link><description>arXiv:2602.02708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for binary classification tasks such as toxicity detection, factuality verification, and causal inference. However, SFT often performs poorly in real-world settings with label noise, class imbalance, or sparse supervision. We introduce BinaryPPO, an offline reinforcement learning large language model (LLM) framework that reformulates binary classification as a reward maximization problem. Our method leverages a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a confidence-weighted reward function that penalizes uncertain or incorrect predictions, enabling the model to learn robust decision policies from static datasets without online interaction. Across eight domain-specific benchmarks and multiple models with differing architectures, BinaryPPO improves accuracy by 40-60 percentage points, reaching up to 99%, substantially outperforming supervised baselines. We provide an in-depth analysis of the role of reward shaping, advantage scaling, and policy stability in enabling this improvement. Overall, we demonstrate that confidence-based reward design provides a robust alternative to SFT for binary classification.

Abstract: Recent multi-LLM agent systems perform well in prompt optimization and automated problem-solving, but many either keep the solver frozen after fine-tuning or rely on a static preference-optimization loop, which becomes intractable for long-horizon tasks. We propose ATLAS (Adaptive Task-distributed Learning for Agentic Self-evolution), a task-distributed framework that iteratively develops a lightweight research agent while delegating complementary roles to specialized supporter agents for exploration, hyperparameter tuning, and reference policy management. Our core algorithm, Evolving Direct Preference Optimization (EvoDPO), adaptively updates the phase-indexed reference policy. We provide a theoretical regret analysis for a preference-based contextual bandit under concept drift. In addition, experiments were conducted on non-stationary linear contextual bandits and scientific machine learning (SciML) loss reweighting for the 1D Burgers' equation. Both results show that ATLAS improves stability and performance over a static single-agent baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02709v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02710</link><description>arXiv:2602.02710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is the method of choice to train models in sampling-based setups with binary outcome feedback, such as navigation, code generation, and mathematical problem solving. In such settings, models implicitly induce a likelihood over correct rollouts. However, we observe that reinforcement learning does not maximize this likelihood, and instead optimizes only a lower-order approximation. Inspired by this observation, we introduce Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning (MaxRL), a sampling-based framework to approximate maximum likelihood using reinforcement learning techniques. MaxRL addresses the challenges of non-differentiable sampling by defining a compute-indexed family of sample-based objectives that interpolate between standard reinforcement learning and exact maximum likelihood as additional sampling compute is allocated. The resulting objectives admit a simple, unbiased policy-gradient estimator and converge to maximum likelihood optimization in the infinite-compute limit. Empirically, we show that MaxRL Pareto-dominates existing methods in all models and tasks we tested, achieving up to 20x test-time scaling efficiency gains compared to its GRPO-trained counterpart. We also observe MaxRL to scale better with additional data and compute. Our results suggest MaxRL is a promising framework for scaling RL training in correctness based settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02710v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Mix Precision Routing for Efficient Multi-step LLM Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02711</link><description>arXiv:2602.02711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) achieve strong performance in long-horizon decision-making tasks through multi-step interaction and reasoning at test time. While practitioners commonly believe a higher task success rate necessitates the use of a larger and stronger LLM model, multi-step interaction with a large LLM incurs prohibitive inference cost. To address this problem, we explore the use of low-precision quantized LLM in the long-horizon decision-making process. Based on the observation of diverse sensitivities among interaction steps, we propose a dynamic mix-precision routing framework that adaptively selects between high-precision and low-precision LLMs at each decision step. The router is trained via a two-stage pipeline, consisting of KL-divergence-based supervised learning that identifies precision-sensitive steps, followed by Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to further improve task success rates. Experiments on ALFWorld demonstrate that our approach achieves a great improvement on accuracy-cost trade-off over single-precision baselines and heuristic routing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02711v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Understanding Steering Strength</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02712</link><description>arXiv:2602.02712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A popular approach to post-training control of large language models (LLMs) is the steering of intermediate latent representations. Namely, identify a well-chosen direction depending on the task at hand and perturbs representations along this direction at inference time. While many propositions exist to pick this direction, considerably less is understood about how to choose the magnitude of the move, whereas its importance is clear: too little and the intended behavior does not emerge, too much and the model's performance degrades beyond repair. In this work, we propose the first theoretical analysis of steering strength. We characterize its effect on next token probability, presence of a concept, and cross-entropy, deriving precise qualitative laws governing these quantities. Our analysis reveals surprising behaviors, including non-monotonic effects of steering strength. We validate our theoretical predictions empirically on eleven language models, ranging from a small GPT architecture to modern models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02712v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] End-to-end reconstruction of OCT optical properties and speckle-reduced structural intensity via physics-based learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02721</link><description>arXiv:2602.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse scattering in optical coherence tomography (OCT) seeks to recover both structural images and intrinsic tissue optical properties, including refractive index, scattering coefficient, and anisotropy. This inverse problem is challenging due to attenuation, speckle noise, and strong coupling among parameters. We propose a regularized end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly reconstructs optical parameter maps and speckle-reduced OCT structural intensity for layer visualization. Trained with Monte Carlo-simulated ground truth, our network incorporates a physics-based OCT forward model that generates predicted signals from the estimated parameters, providing physics-consistent supervision for parameter recovery and artifact suppression. Experiments on the synthetic corneal OCT dataset demonstrate robust optical map recovery under noise, improved resolution, and enhanced structural fidelity. This approach enables quantitative multi-parameter tissue characterization and highlights the benefit of combining physics-informed modeling with deep learning for computational OCT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02721v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Entity-centric Reinforcement Learning with Factored Subgoal Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02722</link><description>arXiv:2602.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical entity-centric framework for offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) that combines subgoal decomposition with factored structure to solve long-horizon tasks in domains with multiple entities. Achieving long-horizon goals in complex environments remains a core challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Domains with multiple entities are particularly difficult due to their combinatorial complexity. GCRL facilitates generalization across goals and the use of subgoal structure, but struggles with high-dimensional observations and combinatorial state-spaces, especially under sparse reward. We employ a two-level hierarchy composed of a value-based GCRL agent and a factored subgoal-generating conditional diffusion model. The RL agent and subgoal generator are trained independently and composed post hoc through selective subgoal generation based on the value function, making the approach modular and compatible with existing GCRL algorithms. We introduce new variations to benchmark tasks that highlight the challenges of multi-entity domains, and show that our method consistently boosts performance of the underlying RL agent on image-based long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, achieving over 150% higher success rates on the hardest task in our suite and generalizing to increasing horizons and numbers of entities.

Abstract: The development of black-box optimization algorithms depends on the availability of benchmark suites that are both diverse and representative of real-world problem landscapes. Widely used collections such as BBOB and CEC remain dominated by hand-crafted synthetic functions and provide limited coverage of the high-dimensional space of Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) features, which in turn biases evaluation and hinders training of meta-black-box optimizers. We introduce Evolution of Test Functions (EoTF), a framework that automatically generates continuous optimization test functions whose landscapes match a specified target ELA feature vector. EoTF adapts LLM-driven evolutionary search, originally proposed for heuristic discovery, to evolve interpretable, self-contained numpy implementations of objective functions by minimizing the distance between sampled ELA features of generated candidates and a target profile. In experiments on 24 noiseless BBOB functions and a contamination-mitigating suite of 24 MA-BBOB hybrid functions, EoTF reliably produces non-trivial functions with closely matching ELA characteristics and preserves optimizer performance rankings under fixed evaluation budgets, supporting their validity as surrogate benchmarks. While a baseline neural-network-based generator achieves higher accuracy in 2D, EoTF substantially outperforms it in 3D and exhibits stable solution quality as dimensionality increases, highlighting favorable scalability. Overall, EoTF offers a practical route to scalable, portable, and interpretable benchmark generation targeted to desired landscape properties.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02724v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated Dysphagia Screening Using Noninvasive Neck Acoustic Sensing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02725</link><description>arXiv:2602.02725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pharyngeal health plays a vital role in essential human functions such as breathing, swallowing, and vocalization. Early detection of swallowing abnormalities, also known as dysphagia, is crucial for timely intervention. However, current diagnostic methods often rely on radiographic imaging or invasive procedures. In this study, we propose an automated framework for detecting dysphagia using portable and noninvasive acoustic sensing coupled with applied machine learning. By capturing subtle acoustic signals from the neck during swallowing tasks, we aim to identify patterns associated with abnormal physiological conditions. Our approach achieves promising test-time abnormality detection performance, with an AUC-ROC of 0.904 under 5 independent train-test splits. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using noninvasive acoustic sensing as a practical and scalable tool for pharyngeal health monitoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02725v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vector Quantized Latent Concepts: A Scalable Alternative to Clustering-Based Concept Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02726</link><description>arXiv:2602.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning models encode rich semantic information in their hidden representations. However, it remains challenging to understand which parts of this information models actually rely on when making predictions. A promising line of post-hoc concept-based explanation methods relies on clustering token representations. However, commonly used approaches such as hierarchical clustering are computationally infeasible for large-scale datasets, and K-Means often yields shallow or frequency-dominated clusters. We propose the vector quantized latent concept (VQLC) method, a framework built upon the vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) architecture that learns a discrete codebook mapping continuous representations to concept vectors. We perform thorough evaluations and show that VQLC improves scalability while maintaining comparable quality of human-understandable explanations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02726v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Search-Augmented Masked Diffusion Models for Constrained Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02727</link><description>arXiv:2602.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models generate sequences by iteratively denoising samples corrupted by categorical noise, offering an appealing alternative to autoregressive decoding for structured and symbolic generation. However, standard training targets a likelihood-based objective that primarily matches the data distribution and provides no native mechanism for enforcing hard constraints or optimizing non-differentiable properties at inference time. This work addresses this limitation and introduces Search-Augmented Masked Diffusion (SearchDiff), a training-free neurosymbolic inference framework that integrates informed search directly into the reverse denoising process. At each denoising step, the model predictions define a proposal set that is optimized under a user-specified property satisfaction, yielding a modified reverse transition that steers sampling toward probable and feasible solutions. Experiments in biological design and symbolic reasoning illustrate that SearchDiff substantially improves constraint satisfaction and property adherence, while consistently outperforming discrete diffusion and autoregressive baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02727v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CAPS: Unifying Attention, Recurrence, and Alignment in Transformer-based Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02729</link><description>arXiv:2602.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents $\textbf{CAPS}$ (Clock-weighted Aggregation with Prefix-products and Softmax), a structured attention mechanism for time series forecasting that decouples three distinct temporal structures: global trends, local shocks, and seasonal patterns. Standard softmax attention entangles these through global normalization, while recent recurrent models sacrifice long-term, order-independent selection for order-dependent causal structure. CAPS combines SO(2) rotations for phase alignment with three additive gating paths -- Riemann softmax, prefix-product gates, and a Clock baseline -- within a single attention layer. We introduce the Clock mechanism, a learned temporal weighting that modulates these paths through a shared notion of temporal importance. Experiments on long- and short-term forecasting benchmarks surpass vanilla softmax and linear attention mechanisms and demonstrate competitive performance against seven strong baselines with linear complexity. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/vireshpati/CAPS-Attention.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02729v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AROLA: A Modular Layered Architecture for Scaled Autonomous Racing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02730</link><description>arXiv:2602.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous racing has advanced rapidly, particularly on scaled platforms, and software stacks must evolve accordingly. In this work, AROLA is introduced as a modular, layered software architecture in which fragmented and monolithic designs are reorganized into interchangeable layers and components connected through standardized ROS 2 interfaces. The autonomous-driving pipeline is decomposed into sensing, pre-processing, perception, localization and mapping, planning, behavior, control, and actuation, enabling rapid module replacement and objective benchmarking without reliance on custom message definitions. To support consistent performance evaluation, a Race Monitor framework is introduced as a lightweight system through which lap timing, trajectory quality, and computational load are logged in real time and standardized post-race analyses are generated. AROLA is validated in simulation and on hardware using the RoboRacer platform, including deployment at the 2025 RoboRacer IV25 competition. Together, AROLA and Race Monitor demonstrate that modularity, transparent interfaces, and systematic evaluation can accelerate development and improve reproducibility in scaled autonomous racing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02730v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting first-episode homelessness among US Veterans using longitudinal EHR data: time-varying models and social risk factors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02731</link><description>arXiv:2602.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homelessness among US veterans remains a critical public health challenge, yet risk prediction offers a pathway for proactive intervention. In this retrospective prognostic study, we analyzed electronic health record (EHR) data from 4,276,403 Veterans Affairs patients during a 2016 observation period to predict first-episode homelessness occurring 3-12 months later in 2017 (prevalence: 0.32-1.19%). We constructed static and time-varying EHR representations, utilizing clinician-informed logic to model the persistence of clinical conditions and social risks over time. We then compared the performance of classical machine learning, transformer-based masked language models, and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that incorporating social and behavioral factors into longitudinal models improved precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC) by 15-30%. In the top 1% risk tier, models yielded positive predictive values ranging from 3.93-4.72% at 3 months, 7.39-8.30% at 6 months, 9.84-11.41% at 9 months, and 11.65-13.80% at 12 months across model architectures. Large language models underperformed encoder-based models on discrimination but showed smaller performance disparities across racial groups. These results demonstrate that longitudinal, socially informed EHR modeling concentrates homelessness risk into actionable strata, enabling targeted and data-informed prevention strategies for at-risk veterans.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02731v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TabPFN for Zero-shot Parametric Engineering Design Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02735</link><description>arXiv:2602.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models for engineering design often require substantial computational cost, large training datasets, and extensive retraining when design requirements or datasets change, limiting their applicability in real-world engineering design workflow. In this work, we propose a zero-shot generation framework for parametric engineering design based on TabPFN, enabling conditional design generation using only a limited number of reference samples and without any task-specific model training or fine-tuning. The proposed method generates design parameters sequentially conditioned on target performance indicators, providing a flexible alternative to conventional generative models. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on three engineering design datasets, i.e., ship hull design, BlendedNet aircraft, and UIUC airfoil. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive diversity across highly structured parametric design spaces, remains robust to variations in sampling, resolution and parameter dimensionality of geometry generation, and achieves a low performance error (e.g., less than 2% in generated ship hull designs' performance). Compared with diffusion-based generative models, the proposed framework significantly reduces computational overhead and data requirements while preserving reliable generation performance. These results highlight the potential of zero-shot, data-efficient generation as a practical and efficient tool for engineering design, enabling rapid deployment, flexible adaptation to new design settings, and ease of integration into real-world engineering workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Time-Critical Multimodal Medical Transportation: Organs, Patients, and Medical Supplies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02736</link><description>arXiv:2602.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely transportation of organs, patients, and medical supplies is critical to modern healthcare, particularly in emergencies and transplant scenarios where even short delays can severely impact outcomes. Traditional ground-based vehicles such as ambulances are often hindered by traffic congestion; while air vehicles such as helicopters are faster but costly. Emerging air vehicles -- Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft -- have lower operating costs, but remain limited by range and susceptibility to weather conditions. A multimodal transportation system that integrates both air and ground vehicles can leverage the strengths of each to enhance overall transportation efficiency. This study introduces a constructive greedy heuristic algorithm for multimodal vehicle dispatching for medical transportation. Four different fleet configurations were tested: (i) ambulances only, (ii) ambulances with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (iii) ambulances with electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, and (iv) a fully integrated fleet of ambulances, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The algorithm incorporates payload consolidation across compatible routes, accounts for traffic congestion in ground operations and weather conditions in aerial operations, while enabling rapid vehicle dispatching compared to computationally intensive optimization models. Using a common set of conditions, we evaluate all four fleet types to identify the most effective configurations for fulfilling medical transportation needs while minimizing operating costs, recharging/fuel costs, and total transportation time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02736v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Noise Lowers The Loss: Rethinking Likelihood-Based Evaluation in Music Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02738</link><description>arXiv:2602.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of music large language models (LLMs) demands robust methods of evaluating output quality, especially in distinguishing high-quality compositions from "garbage music". Curiously, we observe that the standard cross-entropy loss -- a core training metric -- often decrease when models encounter systematically corrupted music, undermining its validity as a standalone quality indicator. To investigate this paradox, we introduce noise injection experiment, where controlled noise signal of varying lengths are injected into musical contexts. We hypothesize that a model's loss reacting positively to these perturbations, specifically a sharp increase ("Peak" area) for short injection, can serve as a proxy for its ability to discern musical integrity. Experiments with MusicGen models in the audio waveform domain confirm that Music LLMs respond more strongly to local, texture-level disruptions than to global semantic corruption. Beyond exposing this bias, our results highlight a new principle: the shape of the loss curve -- rather than its absolute value -- encodes critical information about the quality of the generated content (i.e., model behavior). We envision this profile-based evaluation as a label-free, model-intrinsic framework for assessing musical quality -- opening the door to more principled training objectives and sharper benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02738v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TopoPrune: Robust Data Pruning via Unified Latent Space Topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02739</link><description>arXiv:2602.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric data pruning methods, while practical for leveraging pretrained models, are fundamentally unstable. Their reliance on extrinsic geometry renders them highly sensitive to latent space perturbations, causing performance to degrade during cross-architecture transfer or in the presence of feature noise. We introduce TopoPrune, a framework which resolves this challenge by leveraging topology to capture the stable, intrinsic structure of data. TopoPrune operates at two scales, (1) utilizing a topology-aware manifold approximation to establish a global low-dimensional embedding of the dataset. Subsequently, (2) it employs differentiable persistent homology to perform a local topological optimization on the manifold embeddings, ranking samples by their structural complexity. We demonstrate that our unified dual-scale topological approach ensures high accuracy and precision, particularly at significant dataset pruning rates (e.g., 90%). Furthermore, through the inherent stability properties of topology, TopoPrune is (a) exceptionally robust to noise perturbations of latent feature embeddings and (b) demonstrates superior transferability across diverse network architectures. This study demonstrates a promising avenue towards stable and principled topology-based frameworks for robust data-efficient learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02739v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Framing Responsible Design of AI Mental Well-Being Support: AI as Primary Care, Nutritional Supplement, or Yoga Instructor?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02740</link><description>arXiv:2602.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millions of people now use non-clinical Large Language Model (LLM) tools like ChatGPT for mental well-being support. This paper investigates what it means to design such tools responsibly, and how to operationalize that responsibility in their design and evaluation. By interviewing experts and analyzing related regulations, we found that designing an LLM tool responsibly involves: (1) Articulating the specific benefits it guarantees and for whom. Does it guarantee specific, proven relief, like an over-the-counter drug, or offer minimal guarantees, like a nutritional supplement? (2) Specifying the LLM tool's "active ingredients" for improving well-being and whether it guarantees their effective delivery (like a primary care provider) or not (like a yoga instructor). These specifications outline an LLM tool's pertinent risks, appropriate evaluation metrics, and the respective responsibilities of LLM developers, tool designers, and users. These analogies - LLM tools as supplements, drugs, yoga instructors, and primary care providers - can scaffold further conversations about their responsible design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02740v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PokeNet: Learning Kinematic Models of Articulated Objects from Human Observations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02741</link><description>arXiv:2602.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Articulation modeling enables robots to learn joint parameters of articulated objects for effective manipulation which can then be used downstream for skill learning or planning. Existing approaches often rely on prior knowledge about the objects, such as the number or type of joints. Some of these approaches also fail to recover occluded joints that are only revealed during interaction. Others require large numbers of multi-view images for every object, which is impractical in real-world settings. Furthermore, prior works neglect the order of manipulations, which is essential for many multi-DoF objects where one joint must be operated before another, such as a dishwasher. We introduce PokeNet, an end-to-end framework that estimates articulation models from a single human demonstration without prior object knowledge. Given a sequence of point cloud observations of a human manipulating an unknown object, PokeNet predicts joint parameters, infers manipulation order, and tracks joint states over time. PokeNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, improving joint axis and state estimation accuracy by an average of over 27% across diverse objects, including novel and unseen categories. We demonstrate these gains in both simulation and real-world environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02741v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Entropy-Guided Dynamic Tokens for Graph-LLM Alignment in Molecular Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02742</link><description>arXiv:2602.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular understanding is central to advancing areas such as scientific discovery, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to understand molecular graphs effectively. Existing graph-LLM bridges often adapt the Q-Former-style connector with fixed-length static tokens, which is originally designed for vision tasks. These designs overlook stereochemistry and substructural context and typically require costly LLM-backbone fine-tuning, limiting efficiency and generalization. We introduce EDT-Former, an Entropy-guided Dynamic Token Transformer that generates tokens aligned with informative molecular patches, thereby preserving both local and global structural features for molecular graph understanding. Beyond prior approaches, EDT-Former enables alignment between frozen graph encoders and LLMs without tuning the LLM backbone (excluding the embedding layer), resulting in computationally efficient finetuning, and achieves stateof-the-art results on MoleculeQA, Molecule-oriented Mol-Instructions, and property prediction benchmarks (TDC, MoleculeNet), underscoring its effectiveness for scalable and generalizable multimodal molecular understanding</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02742v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Collaborative Immersive Visualization &amp; Analytics for High-Dimensional Scientific Data through Domain Expert Perspectives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02743</link><description>arXiv:2602.02743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-disciplinary teams increasingly work with high-dimensional scientific datasets, yet fragmented toolchains and limited support for shared exploration hinder collaboration. Prior immersive visualization and analytics research has emphasized individual interaction, leaving open how multi-user collaboration can be supported at scale. To fill this critical gap, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 20 domain experts from diverse academic, government, and industry backgrounds. Using deductive-inductive hybrid thematic analysis, we identify four collaboration-focused themes: workflow challenges, adoption perceptions, prospective features, and anticipated usability and ethical risks. These findings show how current ecosystems disrupt coordination and shared understanding, while highlighting opportunities for effective multi-user engagement. Our study contributes empirical insights into collaboration practices for high-dimensional scientific data visualization and analysis, offering design implications to enhance coordination, mutual awareness, and equitable participation in next-generation collaborative immersive platforms. These contributions point toward future environments enabling distributed, cross-device teamwork on high-dimensional scientific data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02743v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ethical Asymmetry in Human-Robot Interaction - An Empirical Test of Sparrow's Hypothesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02745</link><description>arXiv:2602.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ethics of human-robot interaction (HRI) have been discussed extensively based on three traditional frameworks: deontology, consequentialism, and virtue ethics. We conducted a mixed within/between experiment to investigate Sparrow's proposed ethical asymmetry hypothesis in human treatment of robots. The moral permissibility of action (MPA) was manipulated as a subject grouping variable, and virtue type (prudence, justice, courage, and temperance) was controlled as a within-subjects factor. We tested moral stimuli using an online questionnaire with Perceived Moral Permissibility of Action (PMPA) and Perceived Virtue Scores (PVS) as response measures. The PVS measure was based on an adaptation of the established Questionnaire on Cardinal Virtues (QCV), while the PMPA was based on Malle et al. [39] work. We found that the MPA significantly influenced the PMPA and perceived virtue scores. The best-fitting model to describe the relationship between PMPA and PVS was cubic, which is symmetrical in nature. Our study did not confirm Sparrow's asymmetry hypothesis. The adaptation of the QCV is expected to have utility for future studies, pending additional psychometric property assessments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02745v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Parametrized Complexity View on Robust Scheduling with Budgeted Uncertainty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02748</link><description>arXiv:2602.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a robust single-machine scheduling problem under processing time uncertainty. The uncertainty is modeled using the budgeted approach, where each job has a nominal and deviation processing time, and the number of deviations is bounded by Gamma. The objective is to minimize the maximum number of tardy jobs over all possible scenarios. Since the problem is NP-hard in general, we focus on analyzing its tractability under the assumption that some natural parameter of the problem is bounded by a constant. We consider three parameters: the robustness parameter Gamma, the number of distinct due dates in the instance, and the number of jobs with nonzero deviations. Using parametrized-complexity theory, we prove that the problem is W[1]-hard with respect to Gamma, but can be solved in XP time with respect to the same parameter. With respect to the number of different due dates, we establish a stronger hardness result by showing that the problem remains NP-hard even when there are only two different due dates and is solvable in pseudo-polynomial time when the number of due dates is upper bounded by a constant. To complement these results, we show that the case of a common (single) due date, reduces to a robust binary knapsack problem with equal item profits, which we prove to be solvable in polynomial time. Finally, we prove that the problem is solvable in FPT time with respect to the number of nonzero deviations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02748v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Small Agents Through Strategy Auctions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02751</link><description>arXiv:2602.02751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small language models are increasingly viewed as a promising, cost-effective approach to agentic AI, with proponents claiming they are sufficiently capable for agentic workflows. However, while smaller agents can closely match larger ones on simple tasks, it remains unclear how their performance scales with task complexity, when large models become necessary, and how to better leverage small agents for long-horizon workloads. In this work, we empirically show that small agents' performance fails to scale with task complexity on deep search and coding tasks, and we introduce Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency (SALE), an agent framework inspired by freelancer marketplaces. In SALE, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by a systematic cost-value mechanism and refined via a shared auction memory, enabling per-task routing and continual self-improvement without training a separate router or running all models to completion. Across deep search and coding tasks of varying complexity, SALE reduces reliance on the largest agent by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and consistently improves upon the largest agent's pass@1 with only a negligible overhead beyond executing the final trace. In contrast, established routers that rely on task descriptions either underperform the largest agent or fail to reduce cost -- often both -- underscoring their poor fit for agentic workflows. These results suggest that while small agents may be insufficient for complex workloads, they can be effectively "scaled up" through coordinated task allocation and test-time self-improvement. More broadly, they motivate a systems-level view of agentic AI in which performance gains come less from ever-larger individual models and more from market-inspired coordination mechanisms that organize heterogeneous agents into efficient, adaptive ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02751v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond the Prompt: Assessing Domain Knowledge Strategies for High-Dimensional LLM Optimization in Software Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02752</link><description>arXiv:2602.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background/Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on low-dimensional software engineering optimization tasks ($\le$11 features) but consistently underperform on high-dimensional problems where Bayesian methods dominate. A fundamental gap exists in understanding how systematic integration of domain knowledge (whether from humans or automated reasoning) can bridge this divide.
  Objective/Aim: We compare human versus artificial intelligence strategies for generating domain knowledge. We systematically evaluate four distinct architectures to determine if structured knowledge integration enables LLMs to generate effective warm starts for high-dimensional optimization.
  Method: We evaluate four approaches on MOOT datasets stratified by dimensionality: (1) Human-in-the-Loop Domain Knowledge Prompting (H-DKP), utilizing asynchronous expert feedback loops; (2) Adaptive Multi-Stage Prompting (AMP), implementing sequential constraint identification and validation; (3) Dimension-Aware Progressive Refinement (DAPR), conducting optimization in progressively expanding feature subspaces; and (4) Hybrid Knowledge-Model Approach (HKMA), synthesizing statistical scouting (TPE) with RAG-enhanced prompting. Performance is quantified via Chebyshev distance to optimal solutions and ranked using Scott-Knott clustering against an established baseline for LLM generated warm starts.
  Note that all human studies conducted as part of this study will comply with the policies of our local Institutional Review Board.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02752v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deepfake Pornography is Resilient to Regulatory and Platform Shocks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02754</link><description>arXiv:2602.02754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence tools have made it easier to create realistic, synthetic non-consensual explicit imagery (popularly known as deepfake pornography; hereinafter SNCEI) of people. Once created, this SNCEI is often shared on various websites, causing significant harm to victims. This emerging form of sexual abuse was recently criminalized in the US at the federal level by S.146, the TAKE IT DOWN Act. A week after the bill's passage became effectively imminent, the MrDeepfakes website -- one of the most notorious facilitators of SNCEI creation and dissemination -- shut down. Here, we explore the impact of the bill's passage and the subsequent shutdown as a compound intervention on the dissemination of SNCEI. We select three online forums where sexually explicit content is shared, each containing dedicated subforums to organize various types of sexually explicit content. By leveraging each forum's design, we compare activity in subforums dedicated to SNCEI with that in other pornographic genres using a synthetic control, quasi-experimental approach. Across websites, we observed an increase in the sharing and requests for SNCEI, and, in some cases, in new contributors. These results indicate that the compound intervention did not suppress SNCEI activity overall but instead coincided with its redistribution across platforms, with substantial heterogeneity in timing and magnitude. Together, our findings suggest that deplatforming and regulatory signals alone may shift where and when SNCEI is produced and shared, rather than reducing its prevalence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02754v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Task Solving to Robust Real-World Adaptation in LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02760</link><description>arXiv:2602.02760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed as specialized agents that plan, call tools, and take actions over extended horizons. Yet many existing evaluations assume a "clean interface" where dynamics are specified and stable, tools and sensors are reliable, and success is captured by a single explicit objective-often overestimating real-world readiness. In practice, agents face underspecified rules, unreliable signals, shifting environments, and implicit, multi-stakeholder goals. The challenge is therefore not just solving tasks, but adapting while solving: deciding what to trust, what is wanted, when to verify, and when to fall back or escalate. We stress-test deployment-relevant robustness under four operational circumstances: partial observability, dynamic environments, noisy signals, and dynamic agent state. We benchmark agentic LLMs in a grid-based game with a simple goal but long-horizon execution. Episodes violate clean-interface assumptions yet remain solvable, forcing agents to infer rules, pay for information, adapt to environmental and internal shifts, and act cautiously under noise. Across five state-of-the-art LLM agents, we find large gaps between nominal task-solving and deployment-like robustness. Performance generally degrades as grid size and horizon increase, but rankings are unstable: weaker models can beat stronger ones when strategy matches the uncertainty regime. Despite no explicit instruction, agents trade off completion, efficiency, and penalty avoidance, suggesting partial objective inference. Ablations and feature analyses reveal model-specific sensitivities and failure drivers, motivating work on verification, safe action selection, and objective inference under partial observability, noise, and non-stationarity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02760v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Sample Efficiency of Inverse Dynamics Models for Semi-Supervised Imitation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02762</link><description>arXiv:2602.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised imitation learning (SSIL) consists in learning a policy from a small dataset of action-labeled trajectories and a much larger dataset of action-free trajectories. Some SSIL methods learn an inverse dynamics model (IDM) to predict the action from the current state and the next state. An IDM can act as a policy when paired with a video model (VM-IDM) or as a label generator to perform behavior cloning on action-free data (IDM labeling). In this work, we first show that VM-IDM and IDM labeling learn the same policy in a limit case, which we call the IDM-based policy. We then argue that the previously observed advantage of IDM-based policies over behavior cloning is due to the superior sample efficiency of IDM learning, which we attribute to two causes: (i) the ground-truth IDM tends to be contained in a lower complexity hypothesis class relative to the expert policy, and (ii) the ground-truth IDM is often less stochastic than the expert policy. We argue these claims based on insights from statistical learning theory and novel experiments, including a study of IDM-based policies using recent architectures for unified video-action prediction (UVA). Motivated by these insights, we finally propose an improved version of the existing LAPO algorithm for latent action policy learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02762v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exposing Vulnerabilities in Explanation for Time Series Classifiers via Dual-Target Attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02763</link><description>arXiv:2602.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretable time series deep learning systems are often assessed by checking temporal consistency on explanations, implicitly treating this as evidence of robustness. We show that this assumption can fail: Predictions and explanations can be adversarially decoupled, enabling targeted misclassification while the explanation remains plausible and consistent with a chosen reference rationale. We propose TSEF (Time Series Explanation Fooler), a dual-target attack that jointly manipulates the classifier and explainer outputs. In contrast to single-objective misclassification attacks that disrupt explanation and spread attribution mass broadly, TSEF achieves targeted prediction changes while keeping explanations consistent with the reference. Across multiple datasets and explainer backbones, our results consistently reveal that explanation stability is a misleading proxy for decision robustness and motivate coupling-aware robustness evaluations for trustworthy time series tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02763v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SVD-ViT: Does SVD Make Vision Transformers Attend More to the Foreground?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02765</link><description>arXiv:2602.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have been established as large-scale foundation models. However, because self-attention operates globally, they lack an explicit mechanism to distinguish foreground from background. As a result, ViT may learn unnecessary background features and artifacts, leading to degraded classification performance. To address this issue, we propose SVD-ViT, which leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to prioritize the learning of foreground features. SVD-ViT consists of three components-\textbf{SPC module}, \textbf{SSVA}, and \textbf{ID-RSVD}-and suppresses task-irrelevant factors such as background noise and artifacts by extracting and aggregating singular vectors that capture object foreground information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves classification accuracy and effectively learns informative foreground representations while reducing the impact of background noise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02765v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privately Fine-Tuned LLMs Preserve Temporal Dynamics in Tabular Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02766</link><description>arXiv:2602.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on differentially private synthetic tabular data has largely focused on independent and identically distributed rows where each record corresponds to a unique individual. This perspective neglects the temporal complexity in longitudinal datasets, such as electronic health records, where a user contributes an entire (sub) table of sequential events. While practitioners might attempt to model such data by flattening user histories into high-dimensional vectors for use with standard marginal-based mechanisms, we demonstrate that this strategy is insufficient. Flattening fails to preserve temporal coherence even when it maintains valid marginal distributions. We introduce PATH, a novel generative framework that treats the full table as the unit of synthesis and leverages the autoregressive capabilities of privately fine-tuned large language models. Extensive evaluations show that PATH effectively captures long-range dependencies that traditional methods miss. Empirically, our method reduces the distributional distance to real trajectories by over 60% and reduces state transition errors by nearly 50% compared to leading marginal mechanisms while achieving similar marginal fidelity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02766v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Provable Effects of Data Replay in Continual Learning: A Feature Learning Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02767</link><description>arXiv:2602.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to train models on a sequence of tasks while retaining performance on previously learned ones. A core challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where new learning interferes with past knowledge. Among various mitigation strategies, data-replay methods, where past samples are periodically revisited, are considered simple yet effective, especially when memory constraints are relaxed. However, the theoretical effectiveness of full data replay, where all past data is accessible during training, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing full data-replay training in continual learning from a feature learning perspective. Adopting a multi-view data model, we identify the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a critical factor affecting forgetting. Focusing on task-incremental binary classification across $M$ tasks, our analysis verifies two key conclusions: (1) forgetting can still occur under full replay when the cumulative noise from later tasks dominates the signal from earlier ones; and (2) with sufficient signal accumulation, data replay can recover earlier tasks-even if their initial learning was poor. Notably, we uncover a novel insight into task ordering: prioritizing higher-signal tasks not only facilitates learning of lower-signal tasks but also helps prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic and real-world experiments that visualize the interplay between signal learning and noise memorization across varying SNRs and task correlation regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02767v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rate-Distortion Analysis of Optically Passive Vision Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02768</link><description>arXiv:2602.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of remote vision sensors for autonomous decision-making poses the challenge of transmitting high-volume visual data over resource-constrained channels in real-time. In robotics and control applications, many systems can quickly destabilize, which can exacerbate the issue by necessitating higher sampling frequencies. This work proposes a novel sensing paradigm in which an event camera observes the optically generated cosine transform of a visual scene, enabling high-speed, computation-free video compression inspired by modern video codecs. In this study, we simulate this optically passive vision compression (OPVC) scheme and compare its rate-distortion performance to that of a standalone event camera (SAEC). We find that the rate-distortion performance of the OPVC scheme surpasses that of the SAEC and that this performance gap increases as the spatial resolution of the event camera increases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02768v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BiTimeCrossNet: Time-Aware Self-Supervised Learning for Pediatric Sleep</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02769</link><description>arXiv:2602.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BiTimeCrossNet (BTCNet), a multimodal self-supervised learning framework for long physiological recordings such as overnight sleep studies. While many existing approaches train on short segments treated as independent samples, BTCNet incorporates information about when each segment occurs within its parent recording, for example within a sleep session. BTCNet further learns pairwise interactions between physiological signals via cross-attention, without requiring task labels or sequence-level supervision.
  We evaluate BTCNet on pediatric sleep data across six downstream tasks, including sleep staging, arousal detection, and respiratory event detection. Under frozen-backbone linear probing, BTCNet consistently outperforms an otherwise identical non-time-aware variant, with gains that generalize to an independent pediatric dataset. Compared to existing multimodal self-supervised sleep models, BTCNet achieves strong performance, particularly on respiration-related tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02769v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bimanual High-Density EMG Control for In-Home Mobile Manipulation by a User with Quadriplegia</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02773</link><description>arXiv:2602.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile manipulators in the home can enable people with cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) to perform daily physical household tasks that they could not otherwise do themselves. However, paralysis in these users often limits access to traditional robot control interfaces such as joysticks or keyboards. In this work, we introduce and deploy the first system that enables a user with quadriplegia to control a mobile manipulator in their own home using bimanual high-density electromyography (HDEMG). We develop a pair of custom, fabric-integrated HDEMG forearm sleeves, worn on both arms, that capture residual neuromotor activity from clinically paralyzed degrees of freedom and support real-time gesture-based robot control. Second, by integrating vision, language, and motion planning modules, we introduce a shared autonomy framework that supports robust and user-driven teleoperation, with particular benefits for navigation-intensive tasks in home environments. Finally, to demonstrate the system in the wild, we present a twelve-day in-home user study evaluating real-time use of the wearable EMG interface for daily robot control. Together, these system components enable effective robot control for performing activities of daily living and other household tasks in a real home environment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02773v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AmharicStoryQA: A Multicultural Story Question Answering Benchmark in Amharic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02774</link><description>arXiv:2602.02774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing emphasis on multilingual and cultural evaluation benchmarks for large language models, language and culture are often treated as synonymous, and performance is commonly used as a proxy for a models understanding of a given language. In this work, we argue that such evaluations overlook meaningful cultural variation that exists within a single language. We address this gap by focusing on narratives from different regions of Ethiopia and demonstrate that, despite shared linguistic characteristics, region-specific and domain-specific content substantially influences language evaluation outcomes. To this end, we introduce \textbf{\textit{AmharicStoryQA}}, a long-sequence story question answering benchmark grounded in culturally diverse narratives from Amharic-speaking regions. Using this benchmark, we reveal a significant narrative understanding gap in existing LLMs, highlight pronounced regional differences in evaluation results, and show that supervised fine-tuning yields uneven improvements across regions and evaluation settings. Our findings emphasize the need for culturally grounded benchmarks that go beyond language-level evaluation to more accurately assess and improve narrative understanding in low-resource languages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02774v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VerIde ECG Biometrics: Verification and Identification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02776</link><description>arXiv:2602.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics at large scale, evaluating how strongly an ECG can be linked to an individual and, consequently, how its anonymization may be compromised. We show that identity information is already present in tabular representations (fiducial features): even a simple MLP-based embedding network yields non-trivial performance, indicating that anonymization based solely on releasing features does not guarantee privacy. We then adopt embedding-based deep learning models (ArcFace), first on features and then on ECG waveforms, showing a performance jump when moving from tabular inputs to waveforms, and a further gain with larger training sets and consistent normalization across train/val/test. On a large-scale test set, verification achieves high TAR at strict FAR thresholds (TAR=0.908 @ FAR=1e-3; TAR=0.820 @ FAR=1e-4) with EER=2.53% (all-vs-all); closed-set identification yields Rank@1=0.812 and Rank@10=0.910. In open-set, a two-stage pipeline (top-K shortlist on embeddings + re-ranking) reaches DIR@FAR up to 0.976 at FAR=1e-3 and 1e-4. Overall, the results show that ECG carries a measurable individual signature: re-identification is already possible with tabular features and is further amplified by embedding-based models, making privacy implications and realistic operational protocols essential to consider.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02776v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Comparison of Trefftz-Based PINNs and Standard PINNs Focusing on Structure Preservation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02779</link><description>arXiv:2602.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the capability of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to preserve global physical structures by comparing standard PINNs with a Trefftz-based PINN (Trefftz-PINN). The target problem is the reproduction of mag-netic field-line structures in a helical fusion reactor configuration. Using identical training data sampled from exact solutions, we perform comparisons under matched mean squared error (MSE) levels. Visualization of magnetic field lines reveals that standard PINNs may exhibit structural collapse across magnetic surfaces even when the MSE is sufficiently small, whereas Trefftz-PINNs successfully preserve the global topology of magnetic field lines. Furthermore, the proposed framework is extended to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems, where streamline structures of veloc-ity fields are analyzed. Similar tendencies are observed, demonstrating that Trefftz-PINNs provide superior structure preservation compared to standard PINNs. These results indicate that minimizing numerical error alone does not guarantee physical consistency, and that constraining the solution space prior to learning is an effective strategy for physics-consistent surrogate modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02779v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling-Aware Adapter for Structure-Grounded LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02780</link><description>arXiv:2602.02780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are enabling reasoning over biomolecular structures, yet existing methods remain modality-specific and typically compress structural inputs through sequence-based tokenization or fixed-length query connectors. Such architectures either omit the geometric groundings requisite for mitigating structural hallucinations or impose inflexible modality fusion bottlenecks that concurrently over-compress and suboptimally allocate structural tokens, thereby impeding the realization of generalized all-atom reasoning. We introduce Cuttlefish, a unified all-atom LLM that grounds language reasoning in geometric cues while scaling modality tokens with structural complexity. First, Scaling-Aware Patching leverages an instruction-conditioned gating mechanism to generate variable-size patches over structural graphs, adaptively scaling the query token budget with structural complexity to mitigate fixed-length connector bottlenecks. Second, Geometry Grounding Adapter refines these adaptive tokens via cross-attention to modality embeddings and injects the resulting modality tokens into the LLM, exposing explicit geometric cues to reduce structural hallucination. Experiments across diverse all-atom benchmarks demonstrate that Cuttlefish achieves superior performance in heterogeneous structure-grounded reasoning. Code is available at the project repository.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02780v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating False Alarm and Missing Attacks in CAN IDS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02781</link><description>arXiv:2602.02781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern vehicles rely on electronic control units (ECUs) interconnected through the Controller Area Network (CAN), making in-vehicle communication a critical security concern. Machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are increasingly deployed to protect CAN traffic, yet their robustness against adversarial manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present a systematic adversarial evaluation of CAN IDS using the ROAD dataset, comparing four shallow learning models with a deep neural network-based detector. Using protocol-compliant, payload-level perturbations generated via FGSM, BIM and PGD, we evaluate adversarial effects on both benign and malicious CAN frames. While all models achieve strong baseline performance under benign conditions, adversarial perturbations reveal substantial vulnerabilities. Although shallow and deep models are robust to false-alarm induction, with the deep neural network (DNN) performing best on benign traffic, all architectures suffer significant increases in missed attacks. Notably, under gradient-based attacks, the shallow model extra trees (ET) demonstrates improved robustness to missed-attack induction compared to the other models. Our results demonstrate that adversarial manipulation can simultaneously trigger false alarms and evade detection, underscoring the need for adversarial robustness evaluation in safety-critical automotive IDS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02781v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF) for Multimodal Physiological Signals in Self-Supervised Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02784</link><description>arXiv:2602.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multimodal affect modeling when EEG and peripheral physiology are asynchronous, which most fusion methods ignore or handle with costly warping. We propose Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF), a self-supervised module that learns soft bidirectional alignments between modalities and builds a robust clip embedding using time-aware cross attention, a lightweight fusion gate, and alignment-regularized contrastive objectives with optional weak supervision. On the K-EmoCon dataset, under leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation, CTAF yields higher cosine margins for matched pairs and better cross-modal token retrieval within one second, and it is competitive with the baseline on three-bin accuracy and macro-F1 while using few labels. Our contributions are a time-aware fusion mechanism that directly models correspondence, an alignment-driven self-supervised objective tailored to EEG and physiology, and an evaluation protocol that measures alignment quality itself. Our approach accounts for the coupling between the central and autonomic nervous systems in psychophysiological time series. These results indicate that CTAF is a strong step toward label-efficient, generalizable EEG-peripheral fusion under temporal asynchrony.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02784v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smell with Genji: Rediscovering Human Perception through an Olfactory Game with AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02785</link><description>arXiv:2602.02785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Olfaction plays an important role in human perception, yet its subjective and ephemeral nature makes it difficult to articulate, compare, and share across individuals.

In this work, we present Smell with Genji, an AI-mediated olfactory interaction system that reinterprets Genji-ko as a collaborative human-AI sensory experience. By integrating a game setup, a mobile application, and an LLM-powered co-smelling partner equipped with olfactory sensing and LLM-based conversation, the system invites participants to compare scents and construct Genji-mon patterns, fostering reflection through a dialogue that highlights the alignment and discrepancies between human and machine perception. This work illustrates how sensing-enabled AI can participate in olfactory experience alongside users, pointing toward new possibilities for AI-supported sensory interaction and reflection in HCI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02785v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LEMON: Local Explanations via Modality-aware OptimizatioN</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02786</link><description>arXiv:2602.02786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal models are ubiquitous, yet existing explainability methods are often single-modal, architecture-dependent, or too computationally expensive to run at scale. We introduce LEMON (Local Explanations via Modality-aware OptimizatioN), a model-agnostic framework for local explanations of multimodal predictions. LEMON fits a single modality-aware surrogate with group-structured sparsity to produce unified explanations that disentangle modality-level contributions and feature-level attributions. The approach treats the predictor as a black box and is computationally efficient, requiring relatively few forward passes while remaining faithful under repeated perturbations. We evaluate LEMON on vision-language question answering and a clinical prediction task with image, text, and tabular inputs, comparing against representative multimodal baselines. Across backbones, LEMON achieves competitive deletion-based faithfulness while reducing black-box evaluations by 35-67 times and runtime by 2-8 times compared to strong multimodal baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02786v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-World Applications of AI in LTE and 5G-NR Network Infrastructure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02787</link><description>arXiv:2602.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telecommunications networks generate extensive performance and environmental telemetry, yet most LTE and 5G-NR deployments still rely on static, manually engineered configurations. This limits adaptability in rural, nomadic, and bandwidth-constrained environments where traffic distributions, propagation characteristics, and user behavior fluctuate rapidly. Artificial Intelligence (AI), more specifically Machine Learning (ML) models, provide new opportunities to transition Radio Access Networks (RANs) from rigid, rule-based systems toward adaptive, self-optimizing infrastructures that can respond autonomously to these dynamics. This paper proposes a practical architecture incorporating AI-assisted planning, reinforcement-learning-based RAN optimization, real-time telemetry analytics, and digital-twin-based validation. In parallel, the paper addresses the challenge of delivering embodied-AI healthcare services, educational tools, and large language model (LLM) applications to communities with insufficient backhaul for cloud computing. We introduce an edge-hosted execution model in which applications run directly on LTE/5G-NR base stations using containers, reducing latency and bandwidth consumption while improving resilience. Together, these contributions demonstrate how AI can enhance network performance, reduce operational overhead, and expand access to advanced digital services, aligning with broader goals of sustainable and inclusive network development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02787v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structure-Preserving Learning Improves Geometry Generalization in Neural PDEs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02788</link><description>arXiv:2602.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to develop physics foundation models for science and engineering that provide real-time solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) which preserve structure and accuracy under adaptation to unseen geometries. To this end, we introduce General-Geometry Neural Whitney Forms (Geo-NeW): a data-driven finite element method. We jointly learn a differential operator and compatible reduced finite element spaces defined on the underlying geometry. The resulting model is solved to generate predictions, while exactly preserving physical conservation laws through Finite Element Exterior Calculus. Geometry enters the model as a discretized mesh both through a transformer-based encoding and as the basis for the learned finite element spaces. This explicitly connects the underlying geometry and imposed boundary conditions to the solution, providing a powerful inductive bias for learning neural PDEs, which we demonstrate improves generalization to unseen domains. We provide a novel parameterization of the constitutive model ensuring the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several steady-state PDE benchmarks, and provides a significant improvement over conventional baselines on out-of-distribution geometries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02788v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causality--\Delta: Jacobian-Based Dependency Analysis in Flow Matching Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02793</link><description>arXiv:2602.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching learns a velocity field that transports a base distribution to data. We study how small latent perturbations propagate through these flows and show that Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) provide a practical lens on dependency structure in the generated features. We derive closed-form expressions for the optimal drift and its Jacobian in Gaussian and mixture-of-Gaussian settings, revealing that even globally nonlinear flows admit local affine structure. In low-dimensional synthetic benchmarks, numerical JVPs recover the analytical Jacobians. In image domains, composing the flow with an attribute classifier yields an attribute-level JVP estimator that recovers empirical correlations on MNIST and CelebA. Conditioning on small classifier-Jacobian norms reduces correlations in a way consistent with a hypothesized common-cause structure, while we emphasize that this conditioning is not a formal do intervention.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02793v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reshaping Perception Through Technology: From Ancient Script to Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02794</link><description>arXiv:2602.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are reshaping how we create and access information, yet we typically view perception as merely reactive to stimuli, overlooking how the physical qualities of different media uniquely shape cognition. Drawing on Marshall McLuhan's insight that the medium is the massage, we trace a lineage of technologies -- from DNA and the nervous system to language, writing, music, and now LLMs -- that mold perception in distinct ways. We observe that as technologies become more advanced and decoupled from our physiology, they introduce both greater creative potential and greater risk: they enable more efficient play, storage, and transmission, while also introducing artificiality and the potential for inauthenticity and manipulation. This tension is particularly acute with LLMs, which allow rapid, playful generation of content increasingly indistinguishable from human-created work. Noting that humans have a recurring tendency to project intelligence onto novel technologies (a pattern visible in ancient responses to writing), we argue that AI should be framed not as a competitor but as a medium that reshapes perceptual skills and enables new forms of creativity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02794v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Joint Learning of Hierarchical Neural Options and Abstract World Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02799</link><description>arXiv:2602.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building agents that can perform new skills by composing existing skills is a long-standing goal of AI agent research. Towards this end, we investigate how to efficiently acquire a sequence of skills, formalized as hierarchical neural options. However, existing model-free hierarchical reinforcement algorithms need a lot of data. We propose a novel method, which we call AgentOWL (Option and World model Learning Agent), that jointly learns -- in a sample efficient way -- an abstract world model (abstracting across both states and time) and a set of hierarchical neural options. We show, on a subset of Object-Centric Atari games, that our method can learn more skills using much less data than baseline methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02799v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LmPT: Conditional Point Transformer for Anatomical Landmark Detection on 3D Point Clouds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02808</link><description>arXiv:2602.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of anatomical landmarks is crucial for various medical applications. Traditional manual landmarking is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while rule-based methods are often tailored to specific geometries or limited sets of landmarks. In recent years, anatomical surfaces have been effectively represented as point clouds, which are lightweight structures composed of spatial coordinates. Following this strategy and to overcome the limitations of existing landmarking techniques, we propose Landmark Point Transformer (LmPT), a method for automatic anatomical landmark detection on point clouds that can leverage homologous bones from different species for translational research. The LmPT model incorporates a conditioning mechanism that enables adaptability to different input types to conduct cross-species learning. We focus the evaluation of our approach on femoral landmarking using both human and newly annotated dog femurs, demonstrating its generalization and effectiveness across species. The code and dog femur dataset will be publicly available at: https://github.com/Pierreoo/LandmarkPointTransformer.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02808v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Counterfactual Estimation of Conditional Greeks via Malliavin-based Weak Derivatives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02811</link><description>arXiv:2602.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study counterfactual gradient estimation of conditional loss functionals of diffusion processes. In quantitative finance, these gradients are known as conditional Greeks: the sensitivity of expected market values, conditioned on some event of interest. The difficulty is that when the conditioning event has vanishing or zero probability, naive Monte Carlo estimators are prohibitively inefficient; kernel smoothing, though common, suffers from slow convergence. We propose a two-stage kernel-free methodology. First, we show using Malliavin calculus that the conditional loss functional of a diffusion process admits an exact representation as a Skorohod integral, yielding classical Monte-Carlo estimator variance and convergence rates. Second, we establish that a weak derivative estimate of the conditional loss functional with respect to model parameters can be evaluated algorithmically with constant variance, in contrast to the widely used score function method whose variance grows linearly in the sample path length. Together, these results yield an efficient framework for counterfactual conditional stochastic gradient algorithms and financial Greek computations in rare-event regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02811v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Membership Inference Attacks from Causal Principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02819</link><description>arXiv:2602.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used to quantify training data memorization and assess privacy risks. Standard evaluation requires repeated retraining, which is computationally costly for large models. One-run methods (single training with randomized data inclusion) and zero-run methods (post hoc evaluation) are often used instead, though their statistical validity remains unclear. To address this gap, we frame MIA evaluation as a causal inference problem, defining memorization as the causal effect of including a data point in the training set. This novel formulation reveals and formalizes key sources of bias in existing protocols: one-run methods suffer from interference between jointly included points, while zero-run evaluations popular for LLMs are confounded by non-random membership assignment. We derive causal analogues of standard MIA metrics and propose practical estimators for multi-run, one-run, and zero-run regimes with non-asymptotic consistency guarantees. Experiments on real-world data show that our approach enables reliable memorization measurement even when retraining is impractical and under distribution shift, providing a principled foundation for privacy evaluation in modern AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02819v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Tokens to Numbers: Continuous Number Modeling for SVG Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02820</link><description>arXiv:2602.02820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For certain image generation tasks, vector graphics such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) offer clear benefits such as increased flexibility, size efficiency, and editing ease, but remain less explored than raster-based approaches. A core challenge is that the numerical, geometric parameters, which make up a large proportion of SVGs, are inefficiently encoded as long sequences of tokens. This slows training, reduces accuracy, and hurts generalization. To address these problems, we propose Continuous Number Modeling (CNM), an approach that directly models numbers as first-class, continuous values rather than discrete tokens. This formulation restores the mathematical elegance of the representation by aligning the model's inputs with the data's continuous nature, removing discretization artifacts introduced by token-based encoding. We then train a multimodal transformer on 2 million raster-to-SVG samples, followed by fine-tuning via reinforcement learning using perceptual feedback to further improve visual quality. Our approach improves training speed by over 30% while maintaining higher perceptual fidelity compared to alternative approaches. This work establishes CNM as a practical and efficient approach for high-quality vector generation, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Much recent work has argued that the variation in the languages of the world can be explained from the perspective of efficient communication; in particular, languages can be seen as optimally balancing competing pressures to be simple and to be informative. Focusing on the expression of meaning -- semantic typology -- the present paper asks what factors are responsible for successful explanations in terms of efficient communication. Using the Information Bottleneck (IB) approach to formalizing this trade-off, we first demonstrate and analyze a correlation between optimality in the IB sense and a novel generalization of convexity to this setting. In a second experiment, we manipulate various modeling parameters in the IB framework to determine which factors drive the correlation between convexity and optimality. We find that the convexity of the communicative need distribution plays an especially important role. These results move beyond showing that efficient communication can explain aspects of semantic typology into explanations for why that is the case by identifying which underlying factors are responsible.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02821v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Classical Linear $\lambda$-Calculus based on Contraposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02822</link><description>arXiv:2602.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel linear $\lambda$-calculus for Classical Multiplicative Exponential Linear Logic (\MELL) along the lines of the propositions-as-types paradigm. Starting from the standard term assignment for Intuitionistic Multiplicative Linear Logic (\IMLL), we observe that if we incorporate linear negation, its involutive nature implies that both $\typ\limp\typtwo$ and $\lneg\typtwo\limp\lneg\typ$ should have the same proofs. The introduction of a linear modus tollens rule, stating that from $\lneg\typtwo\limp\lneg\typ$ and $\typ$ we may conclude $\typtwo$, allows one to recover classical \MLL. Furthermore, a term assignment for this elimination rule,{the study of proof normalization in a $\lambda$-calculus with this elimination rule} prompts us to define the novel notion of contra-substitution $\tm\cos{\lvar}{\tmtwo}$. Introduced alongside linear substitution, contra-substitution denotes the term that results from ``grabbing'' the unique occurrence of $\lvar$ in $\tm$ and ``pulling'' from it, in order to turn the term $\tm$ inside out (much like a sock) and then replacing $a$ with $\tmtwo$. We call the one-sided natural deduction presentation of classical \MLL, the \CalcMLL-calculus. Guided by the behavior of contra-substitution in the presence of the exponentials, we extend it to a similar presentation for \MELL. We prove that this calculus is sound and complete with respect to \MELL and that it satisfies the standard properties of a typed programming language: subject reduction, confluence and strong normalization. Moreover, we show that several well-known term assignments for classical logic can be encoded in $\CalcMELL$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] R2-Router: A New Paradigm for LLM Routing with Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02823</link><description>arXiv:2602.02823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLMs proliferate with diverse capabilities and costs, LLM routing has emerged by learning to predict each LLM's quality and cost for a given query, then selecting the one with high quality and low cost. However, existing routers implicitly assume a single fixed quality and cost per LLM for each query, ignoring that the same LLM's quality varies with its output length. This causes routers to exclude powerful LLMs when their estimated cost exceeds the budget, missing the opportunity that these LLMs could still deliver high quality at reduced cost with shorter outputs. To address this, we introduce R2-Router, which treats output length budget as a controllable variable and jointly selects the best LLM and length budget, enforcing the budget via length-constrained instructions. This enables R2-Router to discover that a powerful LLM with constrained output can outperform a weaker LLM at comparable cost-efficient configurations invisible to prior methods. Together with the router framework, we construct R2-Bench, the first routing dataset capturing LLM behavior across diverse output length budgets. Experiments show that R2-Router achieves state-of-the-art performance at 4-5x lower cost compared with existing routers. This work opens a new direction: routing as reasoning, where routers evolve from reactive selectors to deliberate reasoners that explore which LLM to use and at what cost budget.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02823v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CATNIP: LLM Unlearning via Calibrated and Tokenized Negative Preference Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02824</link><description>arXiv:2602.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained knowledge memorized in LLMs raises critical concerns over safety and privacy, which has motivated LLM Unlearning as a technique for selectively removing the influences of undesirable knowledge. Existing approaches, rooted in Gradient Ascent (GA), often degrade general domain knowledge while relying on retention data or curated contrastive pairs, which can be either impractical or data and computationally prohibitive. Negative Preference Alignment has been explored for unlearning to tackle the limitations of GA, which, however, remains confined by its choice of reference model and shows undermined performance in realistic data settings. These limitations raise two key questions: i) Can we achieve effective unlearning that quantifies model confidence in undesirable knowledge and uses it to calibrate gradient updates more precisely, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting? ii) Can we make unlearning robust to data scarcity and length variation? We answer both questions affirmatively with CATNIP (Calibrated and Tokenized Negative Preference Alignment), a principled method that rescales unlearning effects in proportion to the model's token-level confidence, thus ensuring fine-grained control over forgetting. Extensive evaluations on MUSE and WMDP benchmarks demonstrated that our work enables effective unlearning without requiring retention data or contrastive unlearning response pairs, with stronger knowledge forgetting and preservation tradeoffs than state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02824v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Col-Bandit: Zero-Shot Query-Time Pruning for Late-Interaction Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02827</link><description>arXiv:2602.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-vector late-interaction retrievers such as ColBERT achieve state-of-the-art retrieval quality, but their query-time cost is dominated by exhaustively computing token-level MaxSim interactions for every candidate document. While approximating late interaction with single-vector representations reduces cost, it often incurs substantial accuracy loss. We introduce Col-Bandit, a query-time pruning algorithm that reduces this computational burden by casting reranking as a finite-population Top-$K$ identification problem. Col-Bandit maintains uncertainty-aware bounds over partially observed document scores and adaptively reveals only the (document, query token) MaxSim entries needed to determine the top results under statistical decision bounds with a tunable relaxation. Unlike coarse-grained approaches that prune entire documents or tokens offline, Col-Bandit sparsifies the interaction matrix on the fly. It operates as a zero-shot, drop-in layer over standard multi-vector systems, requiring no index modifications, offline preprocessing, or model retraining. Experiments on textual (BEIR) and multimodal (REAL-MM-RAG) benchmarks show that Col-Bandit preserves ranking fidelity while reducing MaxSim FLOPs by up to 5$\times$, indicating that dense late-interaction scoring contains substantial redundancy that can be identified and pruned efficiently at query time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Single Revision Step Improves Token-Efficient LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02828</link><description>arXiv:2602.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve higher accuracy on challenging reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute through multiple trajectory sampling. However, standard aggregation methods like majority voting or individual confidence-based filtering face a fundamental "blind spot": they evaluate each trace in isolation. As problems scale in difficulty, models often generate hallucinated paths that exhibit misleadingly high confidence, causing the true solution to be suppressed by a narrow margin in traditional voting. We ask: can we enable traces to "peer-review" each other to resolve these near-miss errors?
  We introduce Packet-Conditioned Revision (PACER), a training-free, inference-only framework that enables reasoning traces to revise their conclusions through a structured coordination step. After a preliminary screening of generated traces, PACER constructs a compact consensus packet containing (i) unique candidate answers, (ii) their aggregated confidence scores, and (iii) representative reasoning summaries for each candidate answer. Individual traces then perform a targeted self-review conditioned on this packet, allowing them to identify specific logical junctions where they diverged from the broader consensus and pivot if their original reasoning is found to be flawed. Final predictions are obtained via confidence-weighted voting over these revised trajectories. On challenging competitive math benchmarks such as AIME and BRUMO, PACER matches or exceeds the accuracy of 256-sample majority voting, significantly outperforming raw ensemble baselines by transforming simple consensus into a collaborative logical refinement process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02828v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Linear Path Model-Based Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02831</link><description>arXiv:2602.02831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interest in combining model-based control approaches with diffusion models has been growing. Although we have seen many impressive robotic control results in difficult tasks, the performance of diffusion models is highly sensitive to the choice of scheduling parameters, making parameter tuning one of the most critical challenges. We introduce Linear Path Model-Based Diffusion (LP-MBD), which replaces the variance-preserving schedule with a flow-matching-inspired linear probability path. This yields a geometrically interpretable and decoupled parameterization that reduces tuning complexity and provides a stable foundation for adaptation. Building on this, we propose Adaptive LP-MBD (ALP-MBD), which leverages reinforcement learning to adjust diffusion steps and noise levels according to task complexity and environmental conditions. Across numerical studies, Brax benchmarks, and mobile-robot trajectory tracking, LP-MBD simplifies scheduling while maintaining strong performance, and ALP-MBD further improves robustness, adaptability, and real-time efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02831v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Koopman Autoencoders with Continuous-Time Latent Dynamics for Fluid Dynamics Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02832</link><description>arXiv:2602.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating the simulation of turbulent flows. However, classical approaches which perform autoregressive rollouts often trade off between strong short-term accuracy and long-horizon stability. Koopman autoencoders, inspired by Koopman operator theory, provide a physics-based alternative by mapping nonlinear dynamics into a latent space where linear evolution is conducted. In practice, most existing formulations operate in a discrete-time setting, limiting temporal flexibility. In this work, we introduce a continuous-time Koopman framework that models latent evolution through numerical integration schemes. By allowing variable timesteps at inference, the method demonstrates robustness to temporal resolution and generalizes beyond training regimes. In addition, the learned dynamics closely adhere to the analytical matrix exponential solution, enabling efficient long-horizon forecasting. We evaluate the approach on classical CFD benchmarks and report accuracy, stability, and extrapolation properties.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02832v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tabula RASA: Exposing and Breaking the Relational Bottleneck in Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02834</link><description>arXiv:2602.02834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers achieve remarkable performance across many domains, yet struggle with tasks requiring multi-hop relational reasoning over structured data. We analyze this limitation through circuit complexity: standard transformers are $\mathsf{TC}^0$-complete and require $\Omega(k)$ layers for $k$-hop reasoning. We introduce RASA (Relation-Aware Sparse Attention), a minimal modification adding: (1) edge-type embeddings that inject relational structure into attention scores, and (2) sparse masking that restricts attention to graph-adjacent positions. While RASA has the same asymptotic depth requirements, sparse masking reduces the attention search space from $O(2^{n^2})$ to $O(2^m)$ patterns, and edge biases provide explicit relation routing. Empirically, on MetaQA (1/2/3-hop) and WebQuestionsSP, RASA outperforms standard transformers and matches GPT-4 at lower cost, with advantages growing with reasoning depth (+7.1 points on 3-hop). We do not claim formal learnability guarantees; the contribution is empirical validation that minimal structural modifications substantially improve multi-hop reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02834v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Content: Behavioral Policies Reveal Actors in Information Operations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02838</link><description>arXiv:2602.02838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of online influence operations -- coordinated campaigns by malicious actors to spread narratives -- has traditionally depended on content analysis or network features. These approaches are increasingly brittle as generative models produce convincing text, platforms restrict access to behavioral data, and actors migrate to less-regulated spaces. We introduce a platform-agnostic framework that identifies malicious actors from their behavioral policies by modeling user activity as sequential decision processes. We apply this approach to 12,064 Reddit users, including 99 accounts linked to the Russian Internet Research Agency in Reddit's 2017 transparency report, analyzing over 38 million activity steps from 2015-2018. Activity-based representations, which model how users act rather than what they post, consistently outperform content models in detecting malicious accounts. When distinguishing trolls -- users engaged in coordinated manipulation -- from ordinary users, policy-based classifiers achieve a median macro-$F_1$ of 94.9%, compared to 91.2% for text embeddings. Policy features also enable earlier detection from short traces and degrade more gracefully under evasion strategies or data corruption. These findings show that behavioral dynamics encode stable, discriminative signals of manipulation and point to resilient, cross-platform detection strategies in the era of synthetic content and limited data access.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02838v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language Movement Primitives: Grounding Language Models in Robot Motion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02839</link><description>arXiv:2602.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling robots to perform novel manipulation tasks from natural language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, despite significant progress in generalized problem solving with foundational models. Large vision and language models (VLMs) are capable of processing high-dimensional input data for visual scene and language understanding, as well as decomposing tasks into a sequence of logical steps; however, they struggle to ground those steps in embodied robot motion. On the other hand, robotics foundation models output action commands, but require in-domain fine-tuning or experience before they are able to perform novel tasks successfully. At its core, there still remains the fundamental challenge of connecting abstract task reasoning with low-level motion control. To address this disconnect, we propose Language Movement Primitives (LMPs), a framework that grounds VLM reasoning in Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) parameterization. Our key insight is that DMPs provide a small number of interpretable parameters, and VLMs can set these parameters to specify diverse, continuous, and stable trajectories. Put another way: VLMs can reason over free-form natural language task descriptions, and semantically ground their desired motions into DMPs -- bridging the gap between high-level task reasoning and low-level position and velocity control. Building on this combination of VLMs and DMPs, we formulate our LMP pipeline for zero-shot robot manipulation that effectively completes tabletop manipulation problems by generating a sequence of DMP motions. Across 20 real-world manipulation tasks, we show that LMP achieves 80% task success as compared to 31% for the best-performing baseline.

While foundation models (FMs) trained on massive datasets demonstrate strong generalization by extracting general-purpose features, they can still suffer from scarce labeled data during downstream fine-tuning. To address this, we propose GeLDA, a semantics-aware generative latent data augmentation framework that leverages conditional diffusion models to synthesize samples in an FM-induced latent space. Because this space is low-dimensional and concentrates task-relevant information compared to the input space, GeLDA enables efficient, high-quality data generation. GeLDA conditions generation on auxiliary feature vectors that capture semantic relationships among classes or subdomains, facilitating data augmentation in low-resource domains. We validate GeLDA in two large-scale recognition tasks: (a) in zero-shot language-specific speech emotion recognition, GeLDA improves the Whisper-large baseline's unweighted average recall by 6.13%; and (b) in long-tailed image classification, it achieves 74.7% tail-class accuracy on ImageNet-LT, setting a new state-of-the-art result.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02841v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chain of Simulation: A Dual-Mode Reasoning Framework for Large Language Models with Dynamic Problem Routing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02842</link><description>arXiv:2602.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Chain of Simulation (CoS), a novel dual-mode reasoning framework that dynamically routes problems to specialized reasoning strategies in Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike existing uniform prompting approaches, CoS employs three distinct reasoning modes: (1) computational flow with self-consistency for mathematical problems, (2) symbolic state tracking with JSON representations for spatial reasoning, and (3) hybrid fact-extraction for multi-hop inference. Through comprehensive evaluation on GSM8K, StrategyQA, and bAbI benchmarks using four state-of-the-art models (Gemma-3 27B, LLaMA-3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Qwen-2.5 14B), we demonstrate that CoS achieves 71.5% accuracy on GSM8K (1.0% absolute improvement), 90.0% on StrategyQA (2.5% improvement), and 19.0% on bAbI (65.2% relative improvement) compared to the strongest baselines. The analysis reveals that problem-specific mode selection is crucial, with computational mode achieving 81.2% accuracy when correctly applied to mathematical problems, while misrouting leads to 0% accuracy. We provide detailed algorithms for mode selection, state tracking, and answer extraction, establishing CoS as an effective approach for improving LLM reasoning without additional training. The framework provides superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency compared to Self-Consistency, achieving comparable performance at 54% lower computational cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02842v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Act or Clarify? Modeling Sensitivity to Uncertainty and Cost in Communication</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02843</link><description>arXiv:2602.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When deciding how to act under uncertainty, agents may choose to act to reduce uncertainty or they may act despite that uncertainty.In communicative settings, an important way of reducing uncertainty is by asking clarification questions (CQs). We predict that the decision to ask a CQ depends on both contextual uncertainty and the cost of alternative actions, and that these factors interact: uncertainty should matter most when acting incorrectly is costly. We formalize this interaction in a computational model based on expected regret: how much an agent stands to lose by acting now rather than with full information. We test these predictions in two experiments, one examining purely linguistic responses to questions and another extending to choices between clarification and non-linguistic action. Taken together, our results suggest a rational tradeoff: humans tend to seek clarification proportional to the risk of substantial loss when acting under uncertainty.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02843v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Kino-PAX$^+$: Near-Optimal Massively Parallel Kinodynamic Sampling-based Motion Planner</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02846</link><description>arXiv:2602.02846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are widely used for robot motion planning with complex kinodynamic constraints in high-dimensional spaces, yet they struggle to achieve \emph{real-time} performance due to their serial computation design. Recent efforts to parallelize SBMPs have achieved significant speedups in finding feasible solutions; however, they provide no guarantees of optimizing an objective function. We introduce Kino-PAX$^{+}$, a massively parallel kinodynamic SBMP with asymptotic near-optimal guarantees. Kino-PAX$^{+}$ builds a sparse tree of dynamically feasible trajectories by decomposing traditionally serial operations into three massively parallel subroutines. The algorithm focuses computation on the most promising nodes within local neighborhoods for propagation and refinement, enabling rapid improvement of solution cost. We prove that, while maintaining probabilistic $\delta$-robust completeness, this focus on promising nodes ensures asymptotic $\delta$-robust near-optimality. Our results show that Kino-PAX$^{+}$ finds solutions up to three orders of magnitude faster than existing serial methods and achieves lower solution costs than a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02846v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Flow Q-Learning for Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02847</link><description>arXiv:2602.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expressive policies based on flow-matching have been successfully applied in reinforcement learning (RL) more recently due to their ability to model complex action distributions from offline data. These algorithms build on standard policy gradients, which assume that there is no unmeasured confounding in the data. However, this condition does not necessarily hold for pixel-based demonstrations when a mismatch exists between the demonstrator's and the learner's sensory capabilities, leading to implicit confounding biases in offline data. We address the challenge by investigating the problem of confounded observations in offline RL from a causal perspective. We develop a novel causal offline RL objective that optimizes policies' worst-case performance that may arise due to confounding biases. Based on this new objective, we introduce a practical implementation that learns expressive flow-matching policies from confounded demonstrations, employing a deep discriminator to assess the discrepancy between the target policy and the nominal behavioral policy. Experiments across 25 pixel-based tasks demonstrate that our proposed confounding-robust augmentation procedure achieves a success rate 120\% that of confounding-unaware, state-of-the-art offline RL methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02847v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero Sum SVD: Balancing Loss Sensitivity for Low Rank LLM Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02848</link><description>arXiv:2602.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in large language models have driven strong performance across many tasks, but their memory and compute costs still hinder deployment. SVD-based compression reduces storage and can speed up inference via low-rank factors, yet performance depends on how rank is allocated under a global compression ratio. Prior methods often use homogeneous ranks for similarly sized matrices, despite large differences in loss sensitivity, or rely on expensive iterative pre-truncation optimization to determine per matrix ranks. We propose \textbf{Zero Sum SVD} (\textbf{ZS-SVD}), a post-training method that performs \emph{global} singular component selection using activation whitening and first-order calibration loss estimates in whitened coordinates. \textbf{ZS-SVD} prunes components across the whole model with a \textbf{zero sum} rule that keeps the cumulative predicted loss change near zero, automatically yielding heterogeneous ranks without solving a rank allocation optimization. Motivated by evidence that gradients near pretrained solutions exhibit low rank structure, we also introduce an optional lightweight correction that applies a \textbf{single} projected gradient update after truncation, followed by re-truncation. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures show consistent gains across diverse benchmarks and compression ratios.

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits remains heavily reliant on expert knowledge, with transistor sizing a major bottleneck due to nonlinear behavior, high-dimensional design spaces, and strict performance constraints. Existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methods typically frame sizing as static black-box optimization, resulting in inefficient and less robust solutions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, they are not suited for precise numerical optimization in AMS sizing. To address this gap, we propose AutoSizer, a reflective LLM-driven meta-optimization framework that unifies circuit understanding, adaptive search-space construction, and optimization orchestration in a closed loop. It employs a two-loop optimization framework, with an inner loop for circuit sizing and an outer loop that analyzes optimization dynamics and constraints to iteratively refine the search space from simulation feedback. We further introduce AMS-SizingBench, an open benchmark comprising 24 diverse AMS circuits in SKY130 CMOS technology, designed to evaluate adaptive optimization policies under realistic simulator-based constraints. AutoSizer experimentally achieves higher solution quality, faster convergence, and higher success rate across varying circuit difficulties, outperforming both traditional optimization methods and existing LLM-based agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation: Learning Per-Layer Symmetry Relaxation from Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02853</link><description>arXiv:2602.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant neural networks exploit underlying task symmetries to improve generalization, but strict equivariance constraints can induce more complex optimization dynamics that can hinder learning. Prior work addresses these limitations by relaxing strict equivariance during training, but typically relies on prespecified, explicit, or implicit target levels of relaxation for each network layer, which are task-dependent and costly to tune. We propose Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation (RECM), a layer-wise constraint modulation mechanism that learns appropriate relaxation levels solely from the training signal and the symmetry properties of each layer's input-target distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge about the task-dependent target relaxation level. We demonstrate that under the proposed RECM update, the relaxation level of each layer provably converges to a value upper-bounded by its symmetry gap, namely the degree to which its input-target distribution deviates from exact symmetry. Consequently, layers processing symmetric distributions recover full equivariance, while those with approximate symmetries retain sufficient flexibility to learn non-symmetric solutions when warranted by the data. Empirically, RECM outperforms prior methods across diverse exact and approximate equivariant tasks, including the challenging molecular conformer generation on the GEOM-Drugs dataset.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02853v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When pre-training hurts LoRA fine-tuning: a dynamical analysis via single-index models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02855</link><description>arXiv:2602.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-training on a source task is usually expected to facilitate fine-tuning on similar downstream problems. In this work, we mathematically show that this naive intuition is not always true: excessive pre-training can computationally slow down fine-tuning optimization. We study this phenomenon for low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on single-index models trained under one-pass SGD. Leveraging a summary statistics description of the fine-tuning dynamics, we precisely characterize how the convergence rate depends on the initial fine-tuning alignment and the degree of non-linearity of the target task. The key take away is that even when the pre-training and down- stream tasks are well aligned, strong pre-training can induce a prolonged search phase and hinder convergence. Our theory thus provides a unified picture of how pre-training strength and task difficulty jointly shape the dynamics and limitations of LoRA fine-tuning in a nontrivial tractable model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02855v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Latent Perspective-Taking via a Schr\"odinger Bridge in Influence-Augmented Local Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02857</link><description>arXiv:2602.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating in environments alongside humans requires robots to make decisions under uncertainty. In addition to exogenous dynamics, they must reason over others' hidden mental-models and mental-states. While Interactive POMDPs and Bayesian Theory of Mind formulations are principled, exact nested-belief inference is intractable, and hand-specified models are brittle in open-world settings. We address both by learning structured mental-models and an estimator of others' mental-states. Building on the Influence-Based Abstraction, we instantiate an Influence-Augmented Local Model to decompose socially-aware robot tasks into local dynamics, social influences, and exogenous factors. We propose (a) a neuro-symbolic world model instantiating a factored, discrete Dynamic Bayesian Network, and (b) a perspective-shift operator modeled as an amortized Schr\"odinger Bridge over the learned local dynamics that transports factored egocentric beliefs into other-centric beliefs. We show that this architecture enables agents to synthesize socially-aware policies in model-based reinforcement learning, via decision-time mental-state planning (a Schr\"odinger Bridge in belief space), with preliminary results in a MiniGrid social navigation task.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02857v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IMAGINE: Intelligent Multi-Agent Godot-based Indoor Networked Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02858</link><description>arXiv:2602.02858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of unknown, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments by an autonomous communication-aware and collaborative group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) presents significant challenges in coordination, perception, and decentralized decision-making. This paper implements Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address these challenges in a 2D indoor environment, using high-fidelity game-engine simulations (Godot) and continuous action spaces. Policy training aims to achieve emergent collaborative behaviours and decision-making under uncertainty using Network-Distributed Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ND-POMDPs). Each UAV is equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and can share data (sensor measurements and a local occupancy map) with neighbouring agents. Inter-agent communication constraints include limited range, bandwidth and latency. Extensive ablation studies evaluated MARL training paradigms, reward function, communication system, neural network (NN) architecture, memory mechanisms, and POMDP formulations. This work jointly addresses several key limitations in prior research, namely reliance on discrete actions, single-agent or centralized formulations, assumptions of a priori knowledge and permanent connectivity, inability to handle dynamic obstacles, short planning horizons and architectural complexity in Recurrent NNs/Transformers. Results show that the scalable training paradigm, combined with a simplified architecture, enables rapid autonomous exploration of an indoor area. The implementation of Curriculum-Learning (five increasingly complex levels) also enabled faster, more robust training. This combination of high-fidelity simulation, MARL formulation, and computational efficiency establishes a strong foundation for deploying learned cooperative strategies in physical robotic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02858v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Late-Stage Generalization Collapse in Grokking: Detecting anti-grokking with Weightwatcher</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02859</link><description>arXiv:2602.02859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \emph{Memorization} in neural networks lacks a precise operational definition and is often inferred from the grokking regime, where training accuracy saturates while test accuracy remains very low. We identify a previously unreported third phase of grokking in this training regime: \emph{anti-grokking}, a late-stage collapse of generalization.
  We revisit two canonical grokking setups: a 3-layer MLP trained on a subset of MNIST and a transformer trained on modular addition, but extended training far beyond standard. In both cases, after models transition from pre-grokking to successful generalization, test accuracy collapses back to chance while training accuracy remains perfect, indicating a distinct post-generalization failure mode.
  To diagnose anti-grokking, we use the open-source \texttt{WeightWatcher} tool based on HTSR/SETOL theory. The primary signal is the emergence of \emph{Correlation Traps}: anomalously large eigenvalues beyond the Marchenko--Pastur bulk in the empirical spectral density of shuffled weight matrices, which are predicted to impair generalization. As a secondary signal, anti-grokking corresponds to the average HTSR layer quality metric $\alpha$ deviating from $2.0$. Neither metric requires access to the test or training data.
  We compare these signals to alternative grokking diagnostic, including $\ell_2$ norms, Activation Sparsity, Absolute Weight Entropy, and Local Circuit Complexity. These track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to identify anti-grokking. Finally, we show that Correlation Traps can induce catastrophic forgetting and/or prototype memorization, and observe similar pathologies in large-scale LLMs, like OSS GPT 20/120B.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02859v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] STEER: Inference-Time Risk Control via Constrained Quality-Diversity Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02862</link><description>arXiv:2602.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for average correctness often exhibit mode collapse, producing narrow decision behaviors on tasks where multiple responses may be reasonable. This limitation is particularly problematic in ordinal decision settings such as clinical triage, where standard alignment removes the ability to trade off specificity and sensitivity (the ROC operating point) based on contextual constraints. We propose STEER (Steerable Tuning via Evolutionary Ensemble Refinement), a training-free framework that reintroduces this tunable control. STEER constructs a population of natural-language personas through an offline, constrained quality-diversity search that promotes behavioral coverage while enforcing minimum safety, reasoning, and stability thresholds. At inference time, STEER exposes a single, interpretable control parameter that maps a user-specified risk percentile to a selected persona, yielding a monotonic adjustment of decision conservativeness. On two clinical triage benchmarks, STEER achieves broader behavioral coverage compared to temperature-based sampling and static persona ensembles. Compared to a representative post-training method, STEER maintains substantially higher accuracy on unambiguous urgent cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous decisions. These results demonstrate STEER as a safety-preserving paradigm for risk control, capable of steering behavior without compromising domain competence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02862v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "I May Not Have Articulated Myself Clearly": Diagnosing Dynamic Instability in LLM Reasoning at Inference Time</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02863</link><description>arXiv:2602.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning failures in large language models (LLMs) are typically measured only at the end of a generation, yet many failures manifest as a process-level breakdown: the model "loses the thread" mid-reasoning. We study whether such breakdowns are detectable from inference-time observables available in standard APIs (token log probabilities), without any training or fine-tuning. We define a simple instability signal that combines consecutive-step distributional shift (JSD) and uncertainty (entropy), summarize each trace by its peak instability strength, and show that this signal reliably predicts failure. Across GSM8K and HotpotQA, instability strength predicts wrong answers with above-chance AUC and yields monotonic bucket-level accuracy decline at scale across model sizes. Crucially, we show that instability is not uniformly harmful: early instability can reflect subsequent stabilization and a correct final answer (\emph{corrective instability}), whereas late instability is more often followed by failure (\emph{destructive instability}), even at comparable peak magnitudes, indicating that recoverability depends not only on how strongly the distribution changes but also on when such changes occur relative to the remaining decoding horizon. The method is model-agnostic, training-free, and reproducible, and is presented as a diagnostic lens rather than a corrective or control mechanism.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02863v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating Structured Chain-of-Thought in Autonomous Vehicles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02864</link><description>arXiv:2602.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the decision-making capabilities of vision-language-action models in autonomous driving, but its autoregressive nature introduces significant inference latency, making it impractical for real-time applications. To address this, we introduce FastDriveCoT, a novel parallel decoding method that accelerates template-structured CoT. Our approach decomposes the reasoning process into a dependency graph of distinct sub-tasks, such as identifying critical objects and summarizing traffic rules, some of which can be generated in parallel. By generating multiple independent reasoning steps concurrently within a single forward pass, we significantly reduce the number of sequential computations. Experiments demonstrate a 3-4$\times$ speedup in CoT generation and a substantial reduction in end-to-end latency across various model architectures, all while preserving the original downstream task improvements brought by incorporating CoT reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02864v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Estimation of Cell-to-Cell Variation and State of Health for Battery Modules with Parallel-Connected Cells</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02866</link><description>arXiv:2602.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating cell-to-cell variation (CtCV) and state of health (SoH) for battery modules with parallel-connected cells is challenging when only module-level signals are measurable and individual cell behaviors remain unobserved. Although progress has been made in SoH estimation, CtCV estimation remains unresolved in the literature. This paper proposes a unified framework that accurately estimates both CtCV and SoH for modules using only module-level information extracted from incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA). With the proposed framework, CtCV and SoH estimations can be decoupled into two separate tasks, allowing each to be solved with dedicated algorithms without mutual interference and providing greater design flexibility. The framework also exhibits strong versatility in accommodating different CtCV metrics, highlighting its general-purpose nature. Experimental validation on modules with three parallel-connected cells demonstrates that the proposed framework can systematically select optimal module-level features for CtCV and SoH estimations, deliver accurate CtCV and SoH estimates with high confidence and low computational complexity, remain effective across different C-rates, and be suitable for onboard implementation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02866v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ViThinker: Active Vision-Language Reasoning via Dynamic Perceptual Querying</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02873</link><description>arXiv:2602.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning excels in language models but struggles in vision-language models due to premature visual-to-text conversion that discards continuous information such as geometry and spatial layout. While recent methods enhance CoT through static enumeration or attention-based selection, they remain passive, i.e., processing pre-computed inputs rather than actively seeking task-relevant details. Inspired by human active perception, we introduce ViThinker, a framework that enables vision-language models to autonomously generate decision (query) tokens triggering the synthesis of expert-aligned visual features on demand. ViThinker internalizes vision-expert capabilities during training, performing generative mental simulation during inference without external tool calls. Through a two-stage curriculum: first distilling frozen experts into model parameters, then learning task-driven querying via sparsity penalties, i.e., ViThinker discovers minimal sufficient perception for each reasoning step. Evaluations across vision-centric benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, validating that active query generation outperforms passive approaches in both perceptual grounding and reasoning accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02873v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Geometry-Aware Efficient Algorithm for Compositional Entropic Risk Minimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02877</link><description>arXiv:2602.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies optimization for a family of problems termed $\textbf{compositional entropic risk minimization}$, in which each data's loss is formulated as a Log-Expectation-Exponential (Log-E-Exp) function. The Log-E-Exp formulation serves as an abstraction of the Log-Sum-Exponential (LogSumExp) function when the explicit summation inside the logarithm is taken over a gigantic number of items and is therefore expensive to evaluate. While entropic risk objectives of this form arise in many machine learning problems, existing optimization algorithms suffer from several fundamental limitations including non-convergence, numerical instability, and slow convergence rates. To address these limitations, we propose a geometry-aware stochastic algorithm, termed $\textbf{SCENT}$, for the dual formulation of entropic risk minimization cast as a min--min optimization problem. The key to our design is a $\textbf{stochastic proximal mirror descent (SPMD)}$ update for the dual variable, equipped with a Bregman divergence induced by a negative exponential function that faithfully captures the geometry of the objective. Our main contributions are threefold: (i) we establish an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate of the proposed SCENT algorithm for convex problems; (ii) we theoretically characterize the advantages of SPMD over standard SGD update for optimizing the dual variable; and (iii) we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of SCENT on extreme classification, partial AUC maximization, contrastive learning and distributionally robust optimization, where it consistently outperforms existing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02877v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Which course?

Abstract: The field of NLP has undergone vast, continuous transformations over the past few years, sparking debates going beyond discipline boundaries. This begs important questions in education: how do we design courses that bridge sub-disciplines in this shifting landscape? This paper explores this question from the angle of discourse processing, an area with rich linguistic insights and computational models for the intentional, attentional, and coherence structure of language. Discourse is highly relevant for open-ended or long-form text generation, yet this connection is under-explored in existing undergraduate curricula. We present a new course, "Computational Discourse and Natural Language Generation". The course is collaboratively designed by a team with complementary expertise and was offered for the first time in Fall 2025 as an upper-level undergraduate course, cross-listed between Linguistics and Computer Science. Our philosophy is to deeply integrate the theoretical and empirical aspects, and create an exploratory mindset inside the classroom and in the assignments. This paper describes the course in detail and concludes with takeaways from an independent survey as well as our vision for future directions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02878v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning-Infused Formal Reasoning: From Contract Synthesis to Artifact Reuse and Formal Semantics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02881</link><description>arXiv:2602.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This vision paper articulates a long-term research agenda for formal methods at the intersection with artificial intelligence, outlining multiple conceptual and technical dimensions and reporting on our ongoing work toward realising this agenda. It advances a forward-looking perspective on the next generation of formal methods based on the integration of automated contract synthesis, semantic artifact reuse, and refinement-based theory. We argue that future verification systems must move beyond isolated correctness proofs toward a cumulative, knowledge-driven paradigm in which specifications, contracts, and proofs are continuously synthesised and transferred across systems. To support this shift, we outline a hybrid framework combining large language models with graph-based representations to enable scalable semantic matching and principled reuse of verification artifacts. Learning-based components provide semantic guidance across heterogeneous notations and abstraction levels, while symbolic matching ensures formal soundness. Grounded in compositional reasoning, this vision points toward verification ecosystems that evolve systematically, leveraging past verification efforts to accelerate future assurance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02881v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reading Between the Tokens: Improving Preference Predictions through Mechanistic Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02882</link><description>arXiv:2602.02882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to predict human preferences in both scientific and business endeavors, yet current approaches rely exclusively on analyzing model outputs without considering the underlying mechanisms. Using election forecasting as a test case, we introduce mechanistic forecasting, a method that demonstrates that probing internal model representations offers a fundamentally different - and sometimes more effective - approach to preference prediction. Examining over 24 million configurations across 7 models, 6 national elections, multiple persona attributes, and prompt variations, we systematically analyze how demographic and ideological information activates latent party-encoding components within the respective models. We find that leveraging this internal knowledge via mechanistic forecasting (opposed to solely relying on surface-level predictions) can improve prediction accuracy. The effects vary across demographic versus opinion-based attributes, political parties, national contexts, and models. Our findings demonstrate that the latent representational structure of LLMs contains systematic, exploitable information about human preferences, establishing a new path for using language models in social science prediction tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02882v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficiency Optimizations for Superblock-based Sparse Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02883</link><description>arXiv:2602.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned sparse retrieval (LSR) is a popular method for first-stage retrieval because it combines the semantic matching of language models with efficient CPU-friendly algorithms. Previous work aggregates blocks into "superblocks" to quickly skip the visitation of blocks during query processing by using an advanced pruning heuristic. This paper proposes a simple and effective superblock pruning scheme that reduces the overhead of superblock score computation while preserving competitive relevance. It combines this scheme with a compact index structure and a robust zero-shot configuration that is effective across LSR models and multiple datasets. This paper provides an analytical justification and evaluation on the MS MARCO and BEIR datasets, demonstrating that the proposed scheme can be a strong alternative for efficient sparse retrieval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02883v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mixture of Concept Bottleneck Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02886</link><description>arXiv:2602.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) promote interpretability by grounding predictions in human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs typically fix their task predictor to a single linear or Boolean expression, limiting both predictive accuracy and adaptability to diverse user needs. We propose Mixture of Concept Bottleneck Experts (M-CBEs), a framework that generalizes existing CBMs along two dimensions: the number of experts and the functional form of each expert, exposing an underexplored region of the design space. We investigate this region by instantiating two novel models: Linear M-CBE, which learns a finite set of linear expressions, and Symbolic M-CBE, which leverages symbolic regression to discover expert functions from data under user-specified operator vocabularies. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that varying the mixture size and functional form provides a robust framework for navigating the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, adapting to different user and task needs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HALT: Hallucination Assessment via Log-probs as Time series</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02888</link><description>arXiv:2602.02888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations remain a major obstacle for large language models (LLMs), especially in safety-critical domains. We present HALT (Hallucination Assessment via Log-probs as Time series), a lightweight hallucination detector that leverages only the top-20 token log-probabilities from LLM generations as a time series. HALT uses a gated recurrent unit model combined with entropy-based features to learn model calibration bias, providing an extremely efficient alternative to large encoders. Unlike white-box approaches, HALT does not require access to hidden states or attention maps, relying only on output log-probabilities. Unlike black-box approaches, it operates on log-probs rather than surface-form text, which enables stronger domain generalization and compatibility with proprietary LLMs without requiring access to internal weights. To benchmark performance, we introduce HUB (Hallucination detection Unified Benchmark), which consolidates prior datasets into ten capabilities covering both reasoning tasks (Algorithmic, Commonsense, Mathematical, Symbolic, Code Generation) and general purpose skills (Chat, Data-to-Text, Question Answering, Summarization, World Knowledge). While being 30x smaller, HALT outperforms Lettuce, a fine-tuned modernBERT-base encoder, achieving a 60x speedup gain on HUB. HALT and HUB together establish an effective framework for hallucination detection across diverse LLM capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02888v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Soupervision: Cooking Model Soups without Labels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02890</link><description>arXiv:2602.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model soups are strange and strangely effective combinations of parameters. They take a model (the stock), fine-tune it into multiple models (the ingredients), and then mix their parameters back into one model (the soup) to improve predictions. While all known soups require supervised learning, and optimize the same loss on labeled data, our recipes for Self-\emph{Soup}ervision generalize soups to self-supervised learning (SSL). Our Self-Souping lets us flavor ingredients on new data sources, e.g. from unlabeled data from a task for transfer or from a shift for robustness. We show that Self-Souping on corrupted test data, then fine-tuning back on uncorrupted train data, boosts robustness by +3.5\% (ImageNet-C) and +7\% (LAION-C). Self-\emph{Soup}ervision also unlocks countless SSL algorithms to cook the diverse ingredients needed for more robust soups. We show for the first time that ingredients can differ in their SSL hyperparameters -- and more surprisingly, in their SSL algorithms. We cook soups of MAE, MoCoV3, and MMCR ingredients that are more accurate than any one single SSL ingredient.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02890v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TraceNAS: Zero-shot LLM Pruning via Gradient Trace Correlation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02891</link><description>arXiv:2602.02891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured pruning is essential for efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The varying sensitivity of LLM sub-blocks to pruning necessitates the identification of optimal non-uniformly pruned models. Existing methods evaluate the importance of layers, attention heads, or weight channels in isolation. Such localized focus ignores the complex global structural dependencies that exist across the model. Training-aware structured pruning addresses global dependencies, but its computational cost can be just as expensive as post-pruning training. To alleviate the computational burden of training-aware pruning and capture global structural dependencies, we propose TraceNAS, a training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that jointly explores structured pruning of LLM depth and width. TraceNAS identifies pruned models that maintain a high degree of loss landscape alignment with the pretrained model using a scale-invariant zero-shot proxy, effectively selecting models that exhibit maximal performance potential during post-pruning training. TraceNAS is highly efficient, enabling high-fidelity discovery of pruned models on a single GPU in 8.5 hours, yielding a 10$\times$ reduction in GPU-hours compared to training-aware methods. Evaluations on the Llama and Qwen families demonstrate that TraceNAS is competitive with training-aware baselines across commonsense and reasoning benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02891v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DoubleTake: Contrastive Reasoning for Faithful Decision-Making in Medical Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02894</link><description>arXiv:2602.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate decision making in medical imaging requires reasoning over subtle visual differences between confusable conditions, yet most existing approaches rely on nearest neighbor retrieval that returns redundant evidence and reinforces a single hypothesis. We introduce a contrastive, document-aware reference selection framework that constructs compact evidence sets optimized for discrimination rather than similarity by explicitly balancing visual relevance, embedding diversity, and source-level provenance using ROCO embeddings and metadata. While ROCO provides large-scale image-caption pairs, it does not specify how references should be selected for contrastive reasoning, and naive retrieval frequently yields near-duplicate figures from the same document. To address this gap, we release a reproducible reference selection protocol and curated reference bank that enable a systematic study of contrastive retrieval in medical image reasoning. Building on these contrastive evidence sets, we propose Counterfactual-Contrastive Inference, a confidence-aware reasoning framework that performs structured pairwise visual comparisons and aggregates evidence using margin-based decision rules with faithful abstention. On the MediConfusion benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving set-level accuracy by nearly 15% relative to prior methods while reducing confusion and improving individual accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02894v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Moving On, Even When You're Broken: Fail-Active Trajectory Generation via Diffusion Policies Conditioned on Embodiment and Task</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02895</link><description>arXiv:2602.02895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot failure is detrimental and disruptive, often requiring human intervention to recover. Maintaining safe operation under impairment to achieve task completion, i.e. fail-active operation, is our target. Focusing on actuation failures, we introduce DEFT, a diffusion-based trajectory generator conditioned on the robot's current embodiment and task constraints. DEFT generalizes across failure types, supports constrained and unconstrained motions, and enables task completion under arbitrary failure. We evaluated DEFT in both simulation and real-world scenarios using a 7-DoF robotic arm. In simulation over thousands of joint-failure cases across multiple tasks, DEFT outperformed the baseline by up to 2 times. On failures unseen during training, it continued to outperform the baseline, indicating robust generalization in simulation. Further, we performed real-world evaluations on two multi-step tasks, drawer manipulation and whiteboard erasing. These experiments demonstrated DEFT succeeding on tasks where classical methods failed. Our results show that DEFT achieves fail-active manipulation across arbitrary failure configurations and real-world deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02895v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Failure-Aware Enhancements for Large Language Model (LLM) Code Generation: An Empirical Study on Decision Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02896</link><description>arXiv:2602.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating software development by translating requirements into code. However, even advanced prompting workflows like progressive prompting often leave some requirements unmet. Although methods such as self-critique, multi-model collaboration, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have been proposed to address these gaps, developers lack clear guidance on when to use each. In an empirical study of 25 GitHub projects, we found that progressive prompting achieves 96.9% average task completion, significantly outperforming direct prompting (80.5%, Cohen's d=1.63, p&lt;0.001) but still leaving 8 projects incomplete. For 6 of the most representative projects, we evaluated each enhancement strategy across 4 failure types. Our results reveal that method effectiveness depends critically on failure characteristics: Self-Critique succeeds on code-reviewable logic errors but fails completely on external service integration (0% improvement), while RAG achieves highest completion across all failure types with superior efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose a decision framework that maps each failure pattern to the most suitable enhancement method, giving practitioners practical, data-driven guidance instead of trial-and-error.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02896v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aligning Language Model Benchmarks with Pairwise Preferences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02898</link><description>arXiv:2602.02898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language model benchmarks are pervasive and computationally-efficient proxies for real-world performance. However, many recent works find that benchmarks often fail to predict real utility. Towards bridging this gap, we introduce benchmark alignment, where we use limited amounts of information about model performance to automatically update offline benchmarks, aiming to produce new static benchmarks that predict model pairwise preferences in given test settings. We then propose BenchAlign, the first solution to this problem, which learns preference-aligned weight- ings for benchmark questions using the question-level performance of language models alongside ranked pairs of models that could be collected during deployment, producing new benchmarks that rank previously unseen models according to these preferences. Our experiments show that our aligned benchmarks can accurately rank unseen models according to models of human preferences, even across different sizes, while remaining interpretable. Overall, our work provides insights into the limits of aligning benchmarks with practical human preferences, which stands to accelerate model development towards real utility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02898v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Controlled disagreement improves generalization in decentralized training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02899</link><description>arXiv:2602.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized training is often regarded as inferior to centralized training because the consensus errors between workers are thought to undermine convergence and generalization, even with homogeneous data distributions. This work challenges this view by introducing decentralized SGD with Adaptive Consensus (DSGD-AC), which intentionally preserves non-vanishing consensus errors through a time-dependent scaling mechanism. We prove that these errors are not random noise but systematically align with the dominant Hessian subspace, acting as structured perturbations that guide optimization toward flatter minima. Across image classification and machine translation benchmarks, DSGD-AC consistently surpasses both standard DSGD and centralized SGD in test accuracy and solution flatness. Together, these results establish consensus errors as a useful implicit regularizer and open a new perspective on the design of decentralized learning algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02899v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Manifold-Constrained Energy-Based Transition Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02900</link><description>arXiv:2602.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement learning is brittle under distribution shift: policy improvement drives rollouts into state--action regions weakly supported by the dataset, where compounding model error yields severe value overestimation. We propose Manifold-Constrained Energy-based Transition Models (MC-ETM), which train conditional energy-based transition models using a manifold projection--diffusion negative sampler. MC-ETM learns a latent manifold of next states and generates near-manifold hard negatives by perturbing latent codes and running Langevin dynamics in latent space with the learned conditional energy, sharpening the energy landscape around the dataset support and improving sensitivity to subtle out-of-distribution deviations. For policy optimization, the learned energy provides a single reliability signal: rollouts are truncated when the minimum energy over sampled next states exceeds a threshold, and Bellman backups are stabilized via pessimistic penalties based on Q-value-level dispersion across energy-guided samples. We formalize MC-ETM through a hybrid pessimistic MDP formulation and derive a conservative performance bound separating in-support evaluation error from truncation risk. Empirically, MC-ETM improves multi-step dynamics fidelity and yields higher normalized returns on standard offline control benchmarks, particularly under irregular dynamics and sparse data coverage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02900v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Minimal Computational Preconditions for Subjective Perspective in Artificial Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02902</link><description>arXiv:2602.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study operationalizes subjective perspective in artificial agents by grounding it in a minimal, phenomenologically motivated internal structure. The perspective is implemented as a slowly evolving global latent state that modulates fast policy dynamics without being directly optimized for behavioral consequences. In a reward-free environment with regime shifts, this latent structure exhibits direction-dependent hysteresis, while policy-level behavior remains comparatively reactive. I argue that such hysteresis constitutes a measurable signature of perspective-like subjectivity in machine systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02902v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spatiotemporal Decision Transformer for Traffic Coordination</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02903</link><description>arXiv:2602.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic signal control is a critical challenge in urban transportation, requiring coordination among multiple intersections to optimize network-wide traffic flow. While reinforcement learning has shown promise for adaptive signal control, existing methods struggle with multi-agent coordination and sample efficiency. We introduce MADT (Multi-Agent Decision Transformer), a novel approach that reformulates multi-agent traffic signal control as a sequence modeling problem. MADT extends the Decision Transformer paradigm to multi-agent settings by incorporating: (1) a graph attention mechanism for modeling spatial dependencies between intersections, (2) a|temporal transformer encoder for capturing traffic dynamics, and (3) return-to-go conditioning for target performance specification. Our approach enables offline learning from historical traffic data, with architecture design that facilitates potential online fine-tuning. Experiments on synthetic grid networks and real-world traffic scenarios demonstrate that MADT achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing average travel time by 5-6% compared to the strongest baseline while exhibiting superior coordination among adjacent intersections.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02903v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FIRE-Bench: Evaluating Agents on the Rediscovery of Scientific Insights</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02905</link><description>arXiv:2602.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate scientific discovery end-to-end, but rigorously evaluating their capacity for verifiable discovery remains a central challenge. Existing benchmarks face a trade-off: they either heavily rely on LLM-as-judge evaluations of automatically generated research outputs or optimize convenient yet isolated performance metrics that provide coarse proxies for scientific insight. To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), a benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question extracted from a published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLMs backbones like gpt-5 on FIRE-Bench. Our results show that full-cycle scientific research remains challenging for current agent systems: even the strongest agents achieve limited rediscovery success (&lt;50 F1), exhibit high variance across runs, and display recurring failure modes in experimental design, execution, and evidence-based reasoning. FIRE-Bench provides a rigorous and diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward reliable agent-driven scientific discovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02905v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Random Matrix Theory Perspective on the Consistency of Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02908</link><description>arXiv:2602.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models trained on different, non-overlapping subsets of a dataset often produce strikingly similar outputs when given the same noise seed. We trace this consistency to a simple linear effect: the shared Gaussian statistics across splits already predict much of the generated images. To formalize this, we develop a random matrix theory (RMT) framework that quantifies how finite datasets shape the expectation and variance of the learned denoiser and sampling map in the linear setting. For expectations, sampling variability acts as a renormalization of the noise level through a self-consistent relation $\sigma^2 \mapsto \kappa(\sigma^2)$, explaining why limited data overshrink low-variance directions and pull samples toward the dataset mean. For fluctuations, our variance formulas reveal three key factors behind cross-split disagreement: \textit{anisotropy} across eigenmodes, \textit{inhomogeneity} across inputs, and overall scaling with dataset size. Extending deterministic-equivalence tools to fractional matrix powers further allows us to analyze entire sampling trajectories. The theory sharply predicts the behavior of linear diffusion models, and we validate its predictions on UNet and DiT architectures in their non-memorization regime, identifying where and how samples deviates across training data split. This provides a principled baseline for reproducibility in diffusion training, linking spectral properties of data to the stability of generative outputs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02908v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning about Reasoning: BAPO Bounds on Chain-of-Thought Token Complexity in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02909</link><description>arXiv:2602.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time scaling via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a major driver of state-of-the-art LLM performance, but it comes with substantial latency and compute costs. We address a fundamental theoretical question: how many reasoning tokens are required to solve a problem as input size grows? By extending the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model--an abstraction of LLMs that quantifies the information flow required to solve a task--we prove lower bounds on the CoT tokens required for three canonical BAPO-hard tasks: binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability. We show that each requires $\Omega(n)$ reasoning tokens when the input size is $n$. We complement these results with matching or near-matching upper bounds via explicit constructions. Finally, our experiments with frontier reasoning models show approximately linear reasoning token scaling on these tasks and failures when constrained to smaller reasoning budgets, consistent with our theoretical lower bounds. Together, our results identify fundamental bottlenecks in inference-time compute through CoT and offer a principled tool for analyzing optimal reasoning length.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02909v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FaceLinkGen: Rethinking Identity Leakage in Privacy-Preserving Face Recognition with Identity Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02914</link><description>arXiv:2602.02914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformation-based privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) aims to verify identities while hiding facial data from attackers and malicious service providers. Existing evaluations mostly treat privacy as resistance to pixel-level reconstruction, measured by PSNR and SSIM. We show that this reconstruction-centric view fails. We present FaceLinkGen, an identity extraction attack that performs linkage/matching and face regeneration directly from protected templates without recovering original pixels. On three recent PPFR systems, FaceLinkGen reaches over 98.5\% matching accuracy and above 96\% regeneration success, and still exceeds 92\% matching and 94\% regeneration in a near zero knowledge setting. These results expose a structural gap between pixel distortion metrics, which are widely used in PPFR evaluation, and real privacy. We show that visual obfuscation leaves identity information broadly exposed to both external intruders and untrusted service providers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Modular Isoperimetric Soft Robotic Truss for Lunar Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02915</link><description>arXiv:2602.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a large-scale robotic system designed as a lightweight, modular, and reconfigurable structure for lunar applications. The system consists of truss-like robotic triangles formed by continuous inflated fabric tubes routed through two robotic roller units and a connecting unit. A newly developed spherical joint enables up to three triangles to connect at a vertex, allowing construction of truss assemblies beyond a single octahedron. When deflated, the triangles compact to approximately the volume of the roller units, achieving a stowed-to-deployed volume ratio of 1:18.3. Upon inflation, the roller units pinch the tubes, locally reducing bending stiffness to form effective joints. Electric motors then translate the roller units along the tube, shifting the pinch point by lengthening one edge while shortening another at the same rate, thereby preserving a constant perimeter (isoperimetric). This shape-changing process requires no additional compressed air, enabling untethered operation after initial inflation. We demonstrate the system as a 12-degree-of-freedom solar array capable of tilting up to 60 degrees and sweeping 360 degrees, and as a 14-degree-of-freedom locomotion device using a step-and-slide gait. This modular, shape-adaptive system addresses key challenges for sustainable lunar operations and future space missions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02915v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Weighted Temporal Decay Loss for Learning Wearable PPG Data with Sparse Clinical Labels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02917</link><description>arXiv:2602.02917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in wearable computing and AI have increased interest in leveraging PPG for health monitoring over the past decade. One of the biggest challenges in developing health algorithms based on such biosignals is the sparsity of clinical labels, which makes biosignals temporally distant from lab draws less reliable for supervision. To address this problem, we introduce a simple training strategy that learns a biomarker-specific decay of sample weight over the time gap between a segment and its ground truth label and uses this weight in the loss with a regularizer to prevent trivial solutions. On smartwatch PPG from 450 participants across 10 biomarkers, the approach improves over baselines. In the subject-wise setting, the proposed approach averages 0.715 AUPRC, compared to 0.674 for a fine-tuned self-supervised baseline and 0.626 for a feature-based Random Forest. A comparison of four decay families shows that a simple linear decay function is most robust on average. Beyond accuracy, the learned decay rates summarize how quickly each biomarker's PPG evidence becomes stale, providing an interpretable view of temporal sensitivity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02917v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Multi-scale Linear-time Encoder for Whole-Slide Image Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02918</link><description>arXiv:2602.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Recurrent Biomedical Linear-time Encoder (MARBLE), the first \textit{purely Mamba-based} multi-state multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. MARBLE processes multiple magnification levels in parallel and integrates coarse-to-fine reasoning within a linear-time state-space model, efficiently capturing cross-scale dependencies with minimal parameter overhead. WSI analysis remains challenging due to gigapixel resolutions and hierarchical magnifications, while existing MIL methods typically operate at a single scale and transformer-based approaches suffer from quadratic attention costs. By coupling parallel multi-scale processing with linear-time sequence modeling, MARBLE provides a scalable and modular alternative to attention-based architectures.

In this work, we first formalize the evolutionary agents as a general Expectation-Maximization framework, where the language model samples candidate programs (E-step) and the system updates the control context based on evaluation feedback (M-step). Under this view, constructing context via full-code snapshots constitutes a suboptimal M-step, as redundant implement details dilutes core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution. To address this, we propose DeltaEvolve, a momentum-driven evolutionary framework that replaces full-code history with structured semantic delta capturing how and why modifications between successive nodes affect performance. As programs are often decomposable, semantic delta usually contains many effective components which are transferable and more informative to drive improvement. By organizing semantic delta through multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism, input tokens are further reduced. Empirical evaluations on tasks across diverse scientific domains show that our framework can discover better solution with less token consumption over full-code-based evolutionary agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02919v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Reproducible Framework for Bias-Resistant Machine Learning on Small-Sample Neuroimaging Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02920</link><description>arXiv:2602.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a reproducible, bias-resistant machine learning framework that integrates domain-informed feature engineering, nested cross-validation, and calibrated decision-threshold optimization for small-sample neuroimaging data. Conventional cross-validation frameworks that reuse the same folds for both model selection and performance estimation yield optimistically biased results, limiting reproducibility and generalization. Demonstrated on a high-dimensional structural MRI dataset of deep brain stimulation cognitive outcomes, the framework achieved a nested-CV balanced accuracy of 0.660\,$\pm$\,0.068 using a compact, interpretable subset selected via importance-guided ranking. By combining interpretability and unbiased evaluation, this work provides a generalizable computational blueprint for reliable machine learning in data-limited biomedical domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02920v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Does the Lagrangian Guide Safe Reinforcement Learning through Diffusion Models?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02924</link><description>arXiv:2602.02924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion policy sampling enables reinforcement learning (RL) to represent multimodal action distributions beyond suboptimal unimodal Gaussian policies. However, existing diffusion-based RL methods primarily focus on offline settings for reward maximization, with limited consideration of safety in online settings. To address this gap, we propose Augmented Lagrangian-Guided Diffusion (ALGD), a novel algorithm for off-policy safe RL. By revisiting optimization theory and energy-based model, we show that the instability of primal-dual methods arises from the non-convex Lagrangian landscape. In diffusion-based safe RL, the Lagrangian can be interpreted as an energy function guiding the denoising dynamics. Counterintuitively, direct usage destabilizes both policy generation and training. ALGD resolves this issue by introducing an augmented Lagrangian that locally convexifies the energy landscape, yielding a stabilized policy generation and training process without altering the distribution of the optimal policy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that ALGD is both theoretically grounded and empirically effective, achieving strong and stable performance across diverse environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02924v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Refining Decision Boundaries In Anomaly Detection Using Similarity Search Within the Feature Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02925</link><description>arXiv:2602.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting rare and diverse anomalies in highly imbalanced datasets-such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in cybersecurity-remains a fundamental challenge for machine learning systems. Active learning offers a promising direction by strategically querying an oracle to minimize labeling effort, yet conventional approaches often fail to exploit the intrinsic geometric structure of the feature space for model refinement. In this paper, we introduce SDA2E, a Sparse Dual Adversarial Attention-based AutoEncoder designed to learn compact and discriminative latent representations from imbalanced, high-dimensional data. We further propose a similarity-guided active learning framework that integrates three novel strategies to refine decision boundaries efficiently: mormal-like expansion, which enriches the training set with points similar to labeled normals to improve reconstruction fidelity; anomaly-like prioritization, which boosts ranking accuracy by focusing on points resembling known anomalies; and a hybrid strategy that combines both for balanced model refinement and ranking. A key component of our framework is a new similarity measure, Normalized Matching 1s (SIM_NM1), tailored for sparse binary embeddings. We evaluate SDA2E extensively across 52 imbalanced datasets, including multiple DARPA Transparent Computing scenarios, and benchmark it against 15 state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Results demonstrate that SDA2E consistently achieves superior ranking performance (nDCG up to 1.0 in several cases) while reducing the required labeled data by up to 80% compared to passive training. Statistical tests confirm the significance of these improvements. Our work establishes a robust, efficient, and statistically validated framework for anomaly detection that is particularly suited to cybersecurity applications such as APT detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distance Marching for Generative Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02928</link><description>arXiv:2602.02928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-unconditional generative models learn time-independent denoising vector fields. But without time conditioning, the same noisy input may correspond to multiple noise levels and different denoising directions, which interferes with the supervision signal. Inspired by distance field modeling, we propose Distance Marching, a new time-unconditional approach with two principled inference methods. Crucially, we design losses that focus on closer targets. This yields denoising directions better directed toward the data manifold. Across architectures, Distance Marching consistently improves FID by 13.5% on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet over recent time-unconditional baselines. For class-conditional ImageNet generation, despite removing time input, Distance Marching surpasses flow matching using our losses and inference methods. It achieves lower FID than flow matching's final performance using 60% of the sampling steps and 13.6% lower FID on average across backbone sizes. Moreover, our distance prediction is also helpful for early stopping during sampling and for OOD detection. We hope distance field modeling can serve as a principled lens for generative modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02928v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RPG-AE: Neuro-Symbolic Graph Autoencoders with Rare Pattern Mining for Provenance-Based Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02929</link><description>arXiv:2602.02929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, long-term cyberattacks that are difficult to detect because they operate stealthily and often blend into normal system behavior. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework that combines a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with rare pattern mining to identify APT-like activities in system-level provenance data. Our approach first constructs a process behavioral graph using k-Nearest Neighbors based on feature similarity, then learns normal relational structure using a Graph Autoencoder. Anomaly candidates are identified through deviations between observed and reconstructed graph structure. To further improve detection, we integrate an rare pattern mining module that discovers infrequent behavioral co-occurrences and uses them to boost anomaly scores for processes exhibiting rare signatures. We evaluate the proposed method on the DARPA Transparent Computing datasets and show that rare-pattern boosting yields substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over the baseline GAE. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches on the same benchmark, our single unified model consistently outperforms individual context-based detectors and achieves performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods that require multiple separate detectors. These results highlight the value of coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining to improve both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02929v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rare Event Early Detection: A Dataset of Sepsis Onset for Critically Ill Trauma Patients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02930</link><description>arXiv:2602.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis is a major public health concern due to its high morbidity, mortality, and cost. Its clinical outcome can be substantially improved through early detection and timely intervention. By leveraging publicly available datasets, machine learning (ML) has driven advances in both research and clinical practice. However, existing public datasets consider ICU patients (Intensive Care Unit) as a uniform group and neglect the potential challenges presented by critically ill trauma patients in whom injury-related inflammation and organ dysfunction can overlap with the clinical features of sepsis. We propose that a targeted identification of post-traumatic sepsis is necessary in order to develop methods for early detection. Therefore, we introduce a publicly available standardized post-trauma sepsis onset dataset extracted, relabeled using standardized post-trauma clinical facts, and validated from MIMIC-III. Furthermore, we frame early detection of post-trauma sepsis onset according to clinical workflow in ICUs in a daily basis resulting in a new rare event detection problem. We then establish a general benchmark through comprehensive experiments, which shows the necessity of further advancements using this new dataset. The data code is available at https://github.com/ML4UWHealth/SepsisOnset_TraumaCohort.git.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02930v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Equal Access, Unequal Interaction: A Counterfactual Audit of LLM Fairness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02932</link><description>arXiv:2602.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work on fairness in large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on access-level behaviors such as refusals and safety filtering. However, equitable access does not ensure equitable interaction quality once a response is provided. In this paper, we conduct a controlled fairness audit examining how LLMs differ in tone, uncertainty, and linguistic framing across demographic identities after access is granted. Using a counterfactual prompt design, we evaluate GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.1-70B on career advice tasks while varying identity attributes along age, gender, and nationality. We assess access fairness through refusal analysis and measure interaction quality using automated linguistic metrics, including sentiment, politeness, and hedging. Identity-conditioned differences are evaluated using paired statistical tests. Both models exhibit zero refusal rates across all identities, indicating uniform access. Nevertheless, we observe systematic, model-specific disparities in interaction quality: GPT-4 expresses significantly higher hedging toward younger male users, while LLaMA exhibits broader sentiment variation across identity groups. These results show that fairness disparities can persist at the interaction level even when access is equal, motivating evaluation beyond refusal-based audits.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02932v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Blame: Rethinking SZZ with Knowledge Graph Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02934</link><description>arXiv:2602.02934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying Bug-Inducing Commits (BICs) is fundamental for understanding software defects and enabling downstream tasks such as defect prediction and automated program repair. Yet existing SZZ-based approaches are limited by their reliance on git blame, which restricts the search space to commits that directly modified the fixed lines. Our preliminary study on 2,102 validated bug-fixing commits reveals that this limitation is significant: over 40% of cases cannot be solved by blame alone, as 28% of BICs require traversing commit history beyond blame results and 14% are blameless.
  We present AgenticSZZ, the first approach to apply Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to software evolution analysis. AgenticSZZ reframes BIC identification from a ranking problem over blame commits into a graph search problem, where temporal ordering is fundamental to causal reasoning about bug introduction. The approach operates in two phases: (1) constructing a TKG that encodes commits with temporal and structural relationships, expanding the search space by traversing file history backward from two reference points (blame commits and the BFC); and (2) leveraging an LLM agent to navigate the graph using specialized tools for candidate exploration and causal analysis.
  Evaluation on three datasets shows that AgenticSZZ achieves F1-scores of 0.48 to 0.74, with statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art by up to 27%. Our ablation study confirms that both components are essential, reflecting a classic exploration-exploitation trade-off: the TKG expands the search space while the agent provides intelligent selection. By transforming BIC identification into a graph search problem, we open a new research direction for temporal and causal reasoning in software evolution analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02934v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems: Dictionary-based Sparse Signal Recovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02942</link><description>arXiv:2602.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems are a key technology for future wireless networks, but the large array aperture naturally creates a hybrid-field (HF) propagation regime in which far-field (FF) planar-wave and near-field (NF) spherical-wave components coexist. This work considers the problem of HF channel estimation (CE) and introduces a unified model that superimposes FF and NF contributions according to the Rayleigh distance boundary. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of the channel in the angular and polar domains, we formulate the estimation task as a sparse recovery problem. Unlike conventional approaches that require prior knowledge of the channel sparsity level, the proposed method operates without requiring knowledge of the sparsity level L and the NF/FF ratio {\gamma}, which are used only for synthetic channel generation in simulations. The channel estimator determines the number of paths adaptively through a residual-based stopping rule. A combined FF/NF dictionary is employed to initialize the support, and each selected atom undergoes continuous parameter refinement to mitigate grid mismatch. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves accurate HF channel reconstruction under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, offering a practical and computationally efficient solution for XL-MIMO systems.

Abstract: Predict-then-Optimize (PTO) pipelines are widely employed in computing and networked systems, where Machine Learning (ML) models are used to predict critical contextual information for downstream decision-making tasks such as cloud LLM serving, data center demand response, and edge workload scheduling. However, these ML predictors are often vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples at test time, leading to significant decision performance degradation due to large prediction errors. To address the generalization challenges under OOD conditions, we present the framework of Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (DR-DFL), which trains ML models to optimize decision performance under the worst-case distribution. Instead of relying on classical Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) techniques, we propose Diffusion-Augmented Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (3D-Learning), which searches for the worst-case distribution within the parameterized space of a diffusion model. By leveraging the powerful distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models, 3D-Learning identifies worst-case distributions that remain consistent with real data, achieving a favorable balance between average and worst-case scenarios. Empirical results on an LLM resource provisioning task demonstrate that 3D-Learning outperforms existing DRO and Data Augmentation methods in OOD generalization performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SRA-Seg: Synthetic to Real Alignment for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02944</link><description>arXiv:2602.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data, an appealing alternative to extensive expert-annotated data for medical image segmentation, consistently fails to improve segmentation performance despite its visual realism. The reason being that synthetic and real medical images exist in different semantic feature spaces, creating a domain gap that current semi-supervised learning methods cannot bridge. We propose SRA-Seg, a framework explicitly designed to align synthetic and real feature distributions for medical image segmentation. SRA-Seg introduces a similarity-alignment (SA) loss using frozen DINOv2 embeddings to pull synthetic representations toward their nearest real counterparts in semantic space. We employ soft edge blending to create smooth anatomical transitions and continuous labels, eliminating the hard boundaries from traditional copy-paste augmentation. The framework generates pseudo-labels for synthetic images via an EMA teacher model and applies soft-segmentation losses that respect uncertainty in mixed regions. Our experiments demonstrate strong results: using only 10% labeled real data and 90% synthetic unlabeled data, SRA-Seg achieves 89.34% Dice on ACDC and 84.42% on FIVES, significantly outperforming existing semi-supervised methods and matching the performance of methods using real unlabeled data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02944v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Role of Graphics in Disaster Communication: Practitioner Perspectives on Use, Challenges, and Inclusivity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02947</link><description>arXiv:2602.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information graphics, such as hazard maps, evacuation diagrams, and pictorial action guides, are widely used in disaster risk communication. These visuals are important because they convey hazard information quickly, reduce reliance on lengthy text, and support decision-making in time-critical situations. However, despite their importance, disaster information graphics do not work equally well for all audiences. In practice, many graphics remain difficult to interpret, and their accessibility for vulnerable populations is still uneven and underexplored. Despite their central role, there has been little empirical work examining how graphics shape disaster communication, what challenges practitioners face in using them, and, most importantly, how inclusive current disaster graphics are in real-world settings. To address this gap, we examine how information graphics are currently produced and used in disaster communication, what issues emerge in practice, and how inclusivity is addressed. We conducted semi-structured interviews with disaster communication practitioners and researchers to examine the role of graphics across preparedness, warning, and response contexts, as well as the barriers experienced by vulnerable communities. Our findings show that graphics are widely expected and heavily relied upon, yet significant accessibility gaps persist for groups such as people with vision impairments, older adults, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Participants also highlighted that inclusive adaptations are difficult to achieve during unfolding emergencies due to operational constraints, limited guidance, and resource barriers. Based on these findings, we outline recommendations for disaster management agencies and graphic designers and identify research directions for technological and adaptive support to make disaster graphics more inclusive at scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02947v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoders (vsPAIR) for Inverse Problems and Uncertainty Quantification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02948</link><description>arXiv:2602.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to many scientific and engineering disciplines; they arise when one seeks to reconstruct hidden, underlying quantities from noisy measurements. Many applications demand not just point estimates but interpretable uncertainty. Providing fast inference alongside uncertainty estimates remains challenging yet desirable in numerous applications.
  We propose the Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoder (vsPAIR) to address this challenge. The architecture pairs a standard VAE encoding observations with a sparse VAE encoding quantities of interest, connected through a learned latent mapping. The variational structure enables uncertainty estimation, the paired architecture encourages interpretability by anchoring QoI representations to clean data, and sparse encodings provide structure by concentrating information into identifiable factors rather than diffusing across all dimensions. We also propose modifications to existing sparse VAE methods: a hard-concrete spike-and-slab relaxation for differentiable training and a beta hyperprior for adaptive sparsity levels. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture, we conduct experiments on blind inpainting and computed tomography, demonstrating that vsPAIR is a capable inverse problem solver that can provide interpretable and structured uncertainty estimates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02948v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] N\"uwa: Mending the Spatial Integrity Torn by VLM Token Pruning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02951</link><description>arXiv:2602.02951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision token pruning has proven to be an effective acceleration technique for the efficient Vision Language Model (VLM). However, existing pruning methods demonstrate excellent performance preservation in visual question answering (VQA) and suffer substantial degradation on visual grounding (VG) tasks. Our analysis of the VLM's processing pipeline reveals that strategies utilizing global semantic similarity and attention scores lose the global spatial reference frame, which is derived from the interactions of tokens' positional information. Motivated by these findings, we propose $\text{N\"uwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors. In the second stage, within the LLM, we perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\text{N\"uwa}$ achieves SOTA performance on multiple VQA benchmarks (from 94% to 95%) and yields substantial improvements on visual grounding tasks (from 7% to 47%).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02951v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UAT-LITE: Inference-Time Uncertainty-Aware Attention for Pretrained Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02952</link><description>arXiv:2602.02952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural NLP models are often miscalibrated, assigning high confidence to incorrect predictions, which undermines selective prediction and high-stakes deployment. Post-hoc calibration methods adjust output probabilities but leave internal computation unchanged, while ensemble and Bayesian approaches improve uncertainty at substantial training or storage cost. We propose UAT-LITE, an inference-time framework that makes self-attention uncertainty-aware using approximate Bayesian inference via Monte Carlo dropout in pretrained transformer classifiers. Token-level epistemic uncertainty is estimated from stochastic forward passes and used to modulate self-attention during contextualization, without modifying pretrained weights or training objectives. We additionally introduce a layerwise variance decomposition to diagnose how predictive uncertainty accumulates across transformer depth. Across the SQuAD 2.0 answerability, MNLI, and SST-2, UAT-LITE reduces Expected Calibration Error by approximately 20% on average relative to a fine-tuned BERT-base baseline while preserving task accuracy, and improves selective prediction and robustness under distribution shift.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02952v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synthetic Data Augmentation for Medical Audio Classification: A Preliminary Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02955</link><description>arXiv:2602.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical audio classification remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, subtle discriminative features, and substantial intra-class variability, often compounded by class imbalance and limited training data. Synthetic data augmentation has been proposed as a potential strategy to mitigate these constraints; however, prior studies report inconsistent methodological approaches and mixed empirical results. In this preliminary study, we explore the impact of synthetic augmentation on respiratory sound classification using a baseline deep convolutional neural network trained on a moderately imbalanced dataset (73%:27%). Three generative augmentation strategies (variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models) were assessed under controlled experimental conditions. The baseline model without augmentation achieved an F1-score of 0.645. Across individual augmentation strategies, performance gains were not observed, with several configurations demonstrating neutral or degraded classification performance. Only an ensemble of augmented models yielded a modest improvement in F1-score (0.664). These findings suggest that, for medical audio classification, synthetic augmentation may not consistently enhance performance when applied to a standard CNN classifier. Future work should focus on delineating task-specific data characteristics, model-augmentation compatibility, and evaluation frameworks necessary for synthetic augmentation to be effective in medical audio applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02955v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quant VideoGen: Auto-Regressive Long Video Generation via 2-Bit KV-Cache Quantization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02958</link><description>arXiv:2602.02958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autoregressive video diffusion, an emerging system algorithm bottleneck limits both deployability and generation capability: KV cache memory. In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02958v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human-Centric Traffic Signal Control for Equity: A Multi-Agent Action Branching Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02959</link><description>arXiv:2602.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating traffic signals along multimodal corridors is challenging because many multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches remain vehicle-centric and struggle with high-dimensional discrete action spaces. We propose MA2B-DDQN, a human-centric multi-agent action-branching double Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework that explicitly optimizes traveler-level equity. Our key contribution is an action-branching discrete control formulation that decomposes corridor control into (i) local, per-intersection actions that allocate green time between the next two phases and (ii) a single global action that selects the total duration of those phases. This decomposition enables scalable coordination under discrete control while reducing the effective complexity of joint decision-making. We also design a human-centric reward that penalizes the number of delayed individuals in the corridor, accounting for pedestrians, vehicle occupants, and transit passengers. Extensive evaluations across seven realistic traffic scenarios in Melbourne, Australia, demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of impacted travelers, outperforming existing DRL and baseline methods. Experiments confirm the robustness of our model, showing minimal variance across diverse settings. This framework not only advocates for a fairer traffic signal system but also provides a scalable solution adaptable to varied urban traffic conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Embodiment-Aware Generalist Specialist Distillation for Unified Humanoid Whole-Body Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02960</link><description>arXiv:2602.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid Whole-Body Controllers trained with reinforcement learning (RL) have recently achieved remarkable performance, yet many target a single robot embodiment. Variations in dynamics, degrees of freedom (DoFs), and kinematic topology still hinder a single policy from commanding diverse humanoids. Moreover, obtaining a generalist policy that not only transfers across embodiments but also supports richer behaviors-beyond simple walking to squatting, leaning-remains especially challenging. In this work, we tackle these obstacles by introducing EAGLE, an iterative generalist-specialist distillation framework that produces a single unified policy that controls multiple heterogeneous humanoids without per-robot reward tuning. During each cycle, embodiment-specific specialists are forked from the current generalist, refined on their respective robots, and new skills are distilled back into the generalist by training on the pooled embodiment set. Repeating this loop until performance convergence produces a robust Whole-Body Controller validated on robots such as Unitree H1, G1, and Fourier N1. We conducted experiments on five different robots in simulation and four in real-world settings. Through quantitative evaluations, EAGLE achieves high tracking accuracy and robustness compared to other methods, marking a step toward scalable, fleet-level humanoid control.

Abstract: Large Language Models are fundamentally reshaping content discovery through AI-native search systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Unlike traditional search engines that match keywords to documents, these systems infer user intent, synthesize multimodal evidence, and generate contextual answers directly on the search page, introducing a paradigm shift from Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). For visual content platforms hosting billions of assets, this poses an acute challenge: individual images lack the semantic depth and authority signals that generative search prioritizes, risking disintermediation as user needs are satisfied in-place without site visits.
  We present Pinterest GEO, a production-scale framework that pioneers reverse search design: rather than generating generic image captions describing what content is, we fine-tune Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to predict what users would actually search for, augmented this with AI agents that mine real-time internet trends to capture emerging search demand. These VLM-generated queries then drive construction of semantically coherent Collection Pages via multimodal embeddings, creating indexable aggregations optimized for generative retrieval. Finally, we employ hybrid VLM and two-tower ANN architectures to build authority-aware interlinking structures that propagate signals across billions of visual assets. Deployed at scale across billions of images and tens of millions of collections, GEO delivers 20\% organic traffic growth contributing to multi-million monthly active user (MAU) growth, demonstrating a principled pathway for visual platforms to thrive in the generative search era.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02961v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Q-ShiftDP: A Differentially Private Parameter-Shift Rule for Quantum Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02962</link><description>arXiv:2602.02962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) promises significant computational advantages, but preserving training data privacy remains challenging. Classical approaches like differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) add noise to gradients but fail to exploit the unique properties of quantum gradient estimation. In this work, we introduce the Differentially Private Parameter-Shift Rule (Q-ShiftDP), the first privacy mechanism tailored to QML. By leveraging the inherent boundedness and stochasticity of quantum gradients computed via the parameter-shift rule, Q-ShiftDP enables tighter sensitivity analysis and reduces noise requirements. We combine carefully calibrated Gaussian noise with intrinsic quantum noise to provide formal privacy and utility guarantees, and show that harnessing quantum noise further improves the privacy-utility trade-off. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Q-ShiftDP consistently outperforms classical DP methods in QML.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02962v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TRACE: Temporal Radiology with Anatomical Change Explanation for Grounded X-ray Report Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02963</link><description>arXiv:2602.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal comparison of chest X-rays is fundamental to clinical radiology, enabling detection of disease progression, treatment response, and new findings. While vision-language models have advanced single-image report generation and visual grounding, no existing method combines these capabilities for temporal change detection. We introduce Temporal Radiology with Anatomical Change Explanation (TRACE), the first model that jointly performs temporal comparison, change classification, and spatial localization. Given a prior and current chest X-ray, TRACE generates natural language descriptions of interval changes (worsened, improved, stable) while grounding each finding with bounding box coordinates. TRACE demonstrates effective spatial localization with over 90% grounding accuracy, establishing a foundation for this challenging new task. Our ablation study uncovers an emergent capability: change detection arises only when temporal comparison and spatial grounding are jointly learned, as neither alone enables meaningful change detection. This finding suggests that grounding provides a spatial attention mechanism essential for temporal reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02963v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Testing Framework Migration with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02964</link><description>arXiv:2602.02964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Python developers rely on two major testing frameworks: \texttt{unittest} and \texttt{Pytest}. While \texttt{Pytest} offers simpler assertions, reusable fixtures, and better interoperability, migrating existing suites from \texttt{unittest} remains a manual and time-consuming process. Automating this migration could substantially reduce effort and accelerate test modernization. In this paper, we investigate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate test framework migrations from \texttt{unittest} to \texttt{Pytest}. We evaluate GPT 4o and Claude Sonnet 4 under three prompting strategies (Zero-shot, One-shot, and Chain-of-Thought) and two temperature settings (0.0 and 1.0). To support this analysis, we first introduce a curated dataset of real-world migrations extracted from the top 100 Python open-source projects. Next, we actually execute the LLM-generated test migrations in their respective test suites. Overall, we find that 51.5% of the LLM-generated test migrations failed, while 48.5% passed. The results suggest that LLMs can accelerate test migration, but there are often caveats. For example, Claude Sonnet 4 exhibited more conservative migrations (e.g., preserving class-based tests and legacy \texttt{unittest} references), while GPT-4o favored more transformations (e.g., to function-based tests). We conclude by discussing multiple implications for practitioners and researchers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02964v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Do Contribution Guidelines Say About Software Testing?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02966</link><description>arXiv:2602.02966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software testing plays a crucial role in the contribution process of open-source projects. For example, contributions introducing new features are expected to include tests, and contributions with tests are more likely to be accepted. Although most real-world projects require contributors to write tests, the specific testing practices communicated to contributors remain unclear. In this paper, we present an empirical study to understand better how software testing is approached in contribution guidelines. We analyze the guidelines of 200 Python and JavaScript open-source software projects. We find that 78\% of the projects include some form of test documentation for contributors. Test documentation is located in multiple sources, including \texttt{CONTRIBUTING} files (58\%), external documentation (24\%), and \texttt{README} files (8\%). Furthermore, test documentation commonly explains how to run tests (83.5\%), but less often provides guidance on how to write tests (37\%). It frequently covers unit tests (71\%), but rarely addresses integration (20.5\%) and end-to-end tests (15.5\%). Other key testing aspects are also less frequently discussed: test coverage (25.5\%) and mocking (9.5\%). We conclude by discussing implications and future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02966v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic High-frequency Convolution for Infrared Small Target Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02969</link><description>arXiv:2602.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared small targets are typically tiny and locally salient, which belong to high-frequency components (HFCs) in images. Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection is challenging, since there are many HFCs along with targets, such as bright corners, broken clouds, and other clutters. Current learning-based methods rely on the powerful capabilities of deep networks, but neglect explicit modeling and discriminative representation learning of various HFCs, which is important to distinguish targets from other HFCs. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dynamic high-frequency convolution (DHiF) to translate the discriminative modeling process into the generation of a dynamic local filter bank. Especially, DHiF is sensitive to HFCs, owing to the dynamic parameters of its generated filters being symmetrically adjusted within a zero-centered range according to Fourier transformation properties. Combining with standard convolution operations, DHiF can adaptively and dynamically process different HFC regions and capture their distinctive grayscale variation characteristics for discriminative representation learning. DHiF functions as a drop-in replacement for standard convolution and can be used in arbitrary SIRST detection networks without significant decrease in computational efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of our DHiF, we conducted extensive experiments across different SIRST detection networks on real-scene datasets. Compared to other state-of-the-art convolution operations, DHiF exhibits superior detection performance with promising improvement.

Abstract: Constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces a fundamental tension between exploration and safety-constrained optimization. Existing leading approaches, such as Lagrangian methods, typically rely on global penalties or centralized critics that react to violations after they occur, often suppressing exploration and leading to over-conservatism. We propose Co2PO, a novel MARL communication-augmented framework that enables coordination-driven safety through selective, risk-aware communication. Co2PO introduces a shared blackboard architecture for broadcasting positional intent and yield signals, governed by a learned hazard predictor that proactively forecasts potential violations over an extended temporal horizon. By integrating these forecasts into a constrained optimization objective, Co2PO allows agents to anticipate and navigate collective hazards without the performance trade-offs inherent in traditional reactive constraints. We evaluate Co2PO across a suite of complex multi-agent safety benchmarks, where it achieves higher returns compared to leading constrained baselines while converging to cost-compliant policies at deployment. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of risk-triggered communication, adaptive gating, and shared memory components.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02970v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Fast Monomial Orders for Gr\"obner Basis Computations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02972</link><description>arXiv:2602.02972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of Gr\"obner basis computation, the standard engine for solving systems of polynomial equations, depends on the choice of monomial ordering. Despite a near-continuum of possible monomial orders, most implementations rely on static heuristics such as GrevLex, guided primarily by expert intuition. We address this gap by casting the selection of monomial orderings as a reinforcement learning problem over the space of admissible orderings. Our approach leverages domain-informed reward signals that accurately reflect the computational cost of Gr\"obner basis computations and admits efficient Monte Carlo estimation. Experiments on benchmark problems from systems biology and computer vision show that the resulting learned policies consistently outperform standard heuristics, yielding substantial reductions in computational cost. Moreover, we find that these policies resist distillation into simple interpretable models, providing empirical evidence that deep reinforcement learning allows the agents to exploit non-linear geometric structure beyond the scope of traditional heuristics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02972v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SceneLinker: Compositional 3D Scene Generation via Semantic Scene Graph from RGB Sequences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02974</link><description>arXiv:2602.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SceneLinker, a novel framework that generates compositional 3D scenes via semantic scene graph from RGB sequences. To adaptively experience Mixed Reality (MR) content based on each user's space, it is essential to generate a 3D scene that reflects the real-world layout by compactly capturing the semantic cues of the surroundings. Prior works struggled to fully capture the contextual relationship between objects or mainly focused on synthesizing diverse shapes, making it challenging to generate 3D scenes aligned with object arrangements. We address these challenges by designing a graph network with cross-check feature attention for scene graph prediction and constructing a graph-variational autoencoder (graph-VAE), which consists of a joint shape and layout block for 3D scene generation. Experiments on the 3RScan/3DSSG and SG-FRONT datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, even in complex indoor environments and under challenging scene graph constraints. Our work enables users to generate consistent 3D spaces from their physical environments via scene graphs, allowing them to create spatial MR content.

Abstract: Embodied agents, such as robots, will need to interact in situated environments where successful communication often depends on reasoning over social norms: shared expectations that constrain what actions are appropriate in context. A key capability in such settings is norm-based reference resolution (NBRR), where interpreting referential expressions requires inferring implicit normative expectations grounded in physical and social context. Yet it remains unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support this kind of reasoning. In this work, we introduce SNIC (Situated Norms in Context), a human-validated diagnostic testbed designed to probe how well state-of-the-art LLMs can extract and utilize normative principles relevant to NBRR. SNIC emphasizes physically grounded norms that arise in everyday tasks such as cleaning, tidying, and serving. Across a range of controlled evaluations, we find that even the strongest LLMs struggle to consistently identify and apply social norms, particularly when norms are implicit, underspecified, or in conflict. These findings reveal a blind spot in current LLMs and highlight a key challenge for deploying language-based systems in socially situated, embodied settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02975v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aligning Forest and Trees in Images and Long Captions for Visually Grounded Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02977</link><description>arXiv:2602.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models such as CLIP struggle with long captions because they align images and texts as undifferentiated wholes. Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains. Yet linguistic hierarchies from syntax or semantics rarely match visual organization, and purely visual hierarchies tend to fragment scenes into appearance-driven parts without semantic focus. We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding. Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior. Experiments show that hierarchical cross-domain alignment enables fine-grained, visually grounded image-text representations to emerge without explicit region-level supervision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02977v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structuring Value Representations via Geometric Coherence in Markov Decision Processes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02978</link><description>arXiv:2602.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric properties can be leveraged to stabilize and speed reinforcement learning. Existing examples include encoding symmetry structure, geometry-aware data augmentation, and enforcing structural restrictions. In this paper, we take a novel view of RL through the lens of order theory and recast value function estimates into learning a desired poset (partially ordered set). We propose \emph{GCR-RL} (Geometric Coherence Regularized Reinforcement Learning) that computes a sequence of super-poset refinements -- by refining posets in previous steps and learning additional order relationships from temporal difference signals -- thus ensuring geometric coherence across the sequence of posets underpinning the learned value functions. Two novel algorithms by Q-learning and by actor--critic are developed to efficiently realize these super-poset refinements. Their theoretical properties and convergence rates are analyzed. We empirically evaluate GCR-RL in a range of tasks and demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and stable performance over strong baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02978v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CPMobius: Iterative Coach-Player Reasoning for Data-Free Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02979</link><description>arXiv:2602.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in complex reasoning, yet their progress remains fundamentally constrained by reliance on massive high-quality human-curated tasks and labels, either through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning-specific data. This dependence renders supervision-heavy training paradigms increasingly unsustainable, with signs of diminishing scalability already evident in practice. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CPM\"obius (CPMobius), a collaborative Coach-Player paradigm for data-free reinforcement learning of reasoning models. Unlike traditional adversarial self-play, CPM\"obius, inspired by real world human sports collaboration and multi-agent collaboration, treats the Coach and Player as independent but cooperative roles. The Coach proposes instructions targeted at the Player's capability and receives rewards based on changes in the Player's performance, while the Player is rewarded for solving the increasingly instructive tasks generated by the Coach. This cooperative optimization loop is designed to directly enhance the Player's mathematical reasoning ability. Remarkably, CPM\"obius achieves substantial improvement without relying on any external training data, outperforming existing unsupervised approaches. For example, on Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, our method improves accuracy by an overall average of +4.9 and an out-of-distribution average of +5.4, exceeding RENT by +1.5 on overall accuracy and R-zero by +4.2 on OOD accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02979v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Invisible Users in Digital Health: A Scoping Review of Digital Interventions to Promote Physical Activity Among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Women</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02982</link><description>arXiv:2602.02982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital health has strong potential for promoting physical activity (PA), yet interventions often fail to sustain engagement among culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) women. Prior reviews focus on short-term efficacy or surface-level localisation, while a design-oriented synthesis of deep cultural adaptation and long-term strategies remain limited. This scoping review systematically screened 1968 records, analysed 18 studies and identified a critical design paradox: techno-solutionist systems overlook social and cultural barriers, while social-support features often fail in low-activity social networks. To address this gap, we propose the Culturally Embedded Interaction Framework, integrating five dimensions: culturally-grounded measurement, multi-modal interaction, contextual and temporal adaptability, embedded social weaving, and theory-guided cultural adaptation. The framework advances beyond accessibility-focused approaches by mapping behavioural theory to design mechanisms that support sustained and culturally plural participation. We provide actionable design principles to help HCI researchers and practitioners move from one-size-fits-all models toward adaptive, theory-informed, and culturally sustaining design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02982v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are LLMs Biased Like Humans?

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in domains where causal reasoning matters, yet it remains unclear whether their judgments reflect normative causal computation, human-like shortcuts, or brittle pattern matching. We benchmark 20+ LLMs against a matched human baseline on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by a collider structure ($C_1 \!\rightarrow\! E\! \leftarrow \!C_2$). We find that a small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well and that most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning strategies than humans who seem to account for unmentioned latent factors in their probability judgments. Furthermore, most LLMs do not mirror the characteristic human collider biases of weak explaining away and Markov violations. We probe LLMs' causal judgment robustness under (i) semantic abstraction and (ii) prompt overloading (injecting irrelevant text), and find that chain-of-thought (CoT) increases robustness for many LLMs. Together, this divergence suggests LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic -- highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02983v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why Some Models Resist Unlearning: A Linear Stability Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02986</link><description>arXiv:2602.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, the ability to erase the effect of specific training samples without retraining from scratch, is critical for privacy, regulation, and efficiency. However, most progress in unlearning has been empirical, with little theoretical understanding of when and why unlearning works. We tackle this gap by framing unlearning through the lens of asymptotic linear stability to capture the interaction between optimization dynamics and data geometry. The key quantity in our analysis is data coherence which is the cross sample alignment of loss surface directions near the optimum. We decompose coherence along three axes: within the retain set, within the forget set, and between them, and prove tight stability thresholds that separate convergence from divergence. To further link data properties to forgettability, we study a two layer ReLU CNN under a signal plus noise model and show that stronger memorization makes forgetting easier: when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is lower, cross sample alignment is weaker, reducing coherence and making unlearning easier; conversely, high SNR, highly aligned models resist unlearning. For empirical verification, we show that Hessian tests and CNN heatmaps align closely with the predicted boundary, mapping the stability frontier of gradient based unlearning as a function of batching, mixing, and data/model alignment. Our analysis is grounded in random matrix theory tools and provides the first principled account of the trade offs between memorization, coherence, and unlearning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large-Scale LLM Inference with Heterogeneous Workloads: Prefill-Decode Contention and Asymptotically Optimal Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02987</link><description>arXiv:2602.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming critical infrastructure for enterprise applications, driving unprecedented demand for GPU-based inference services. A key operational challenge arises from the two-phase nature of LLM inference: a compute-intensive \emph{prefill} phase that processes user input, followed by a memory-bound \emph{decode} phase that generates output tokens. When these phases share GPU resources, prefill tasks throttle the processing speed of concurrent decodes, creating state-dependent contention. This contention is further complicated by workload heterogeneity, as different applications exhibit vastly different input and output lengths. We develop a stochastic control framework for scheduling heterogeneous LLM workloads across large GPU clusters. We formulate LLM inference as a multiclass many-server queueing network with state-dependent service rates, grounded in empirical iteration-time measurements. We analyze the fluid approximation of this system and solve steady-state linear programs that characterize optimal resource allocation. We design gate-and-route policies that regulate prefill admission and decode routing, and prove that they are asymptotically optimal in the many-GPU limit under both bundled and separate token-pricing schemes. We further extend the framework to incorporate Service Level Indicators (SLIs) such as latency and fairness, providing a general approach to constrained scheduling. Numerical experiments calibrated to empirical iteration-time data demonstrate that our policies outperform standard serving heuristics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02987v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NLI:Non-uniform Linear Interpolation Approximation of Nonlinear Operations for Efficient LLMs Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02988</link><description>arXiv:2602.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, but their deployment is often constrained by substantial memory footprints and computational costs. While prior work has achieved significant progress in compressing and accelerating linear layers, nonlinear layers-such as SiLU, RMSNorm, and Softmax-still heavily depend on high-precision floating-point operations. In this paper, we propose a calibration-free, dynamic-programming-optimal, and hardware-friendly framework called Non-uniform Linear Interpolation (NLI). NLI is capable of efficiently approximating a variety of nonlinear functions, enabling seamless integration into LLMs and other deep neural networks with almost no loss in accuracy. NLI ingeniously recasts cutpoint selection as a dynamic-programming problem, achieving the globally minimal interpolation error in O(MxN2) time via Bellman's optimality principle. Based on the NLI algorithm, we also design and implement a plug-and-play universal nonlinear computation unit. Hardware experiments demonstrate that the NLI Engine achieves more than 4x improvement in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art designs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02988v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Repair Lean Proofs from Compiler Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02990</link><description>arXiv:2602.02990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As neural theorem provers become increasingly agentic, the ability to interpret and act on compiler feedback is critical. However, existing Lean datasets consist almost exclusively of correct proofs, offering little supervision for understanding and repairing failures. We study Lean proof repair as a supervised learning problem: given an erroneous proof and compiler feedback, predict both a corrected proof and a natural-language diagnosis grounded in the same feedback. We introduce APRIL (Automated Proof Repair in Lean), a dataset of 260,000 supervised tuples pairing systematically generated proof failures with compiler diagnostics and aligned repair and explanation targets. Training language models on APRIL substantially improves repair accuracy and feedback-conditioned reasoning; in our single-shot repair evaluation setting, a finetuned 4B-parameter model outperforms the strongest open-source baseline. We view diagnostic-conditioned supervision as a complementary training signal for feedback-using provers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to acquire sequence-level planning abilities during training, yet their planning behavior exhibited at inference time often appears short-sighted and inconsistent with these capabilities. We propose a Bayesian account for this gap by grounding planning behavior in the evolving generative context: given the subtle differences between natural language and the language internalized by LLMs, accumulated self-generated context drives a planning-shift during inference and thereby creates the appearance of compromised planning behavior. We further validate the proposed model through two controlled experiments: a random-generation task demonstrating constrained planning under human prompts and increasing planning strength as self-generated context accumulates, and a Gaussian-sampling task showing reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences. These findings provide a theoretical explanation along with empirical evidence for characterizing how LLMs plan ahead during inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02991v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Video-OPD: Efficient Post-Training of Multimodal Large Language Models for Temporal Video Grounding via On-Policy Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02994</link><description>arXiv:2602.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a principled post-training paradigm for Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) due to its on-policy optimization, yet existing GRPO-based methods remain fundamentally constrained by sparse reward signals and substantial computational overhead. We propose Video-OPD, an efficient post-training framework for TVG inspired by recent advances in on-policy distillation. Video-OPD optimizes trajectories sampled directly from the current policy, thereby preserving alignment between training and inference distributions, while a frontier teacher supplies dense, token-level supervision via a reverse KL divergence objective. This formulation preserves the on-policy property critical for mitigating distributional shift, while converting sparse, episode-level feedback into fine-grained, step-wise learning signals. Building on Video-OPD, we introduce Teacher-Validated Disagreement Focusing (TVDF), a lightweight training curriculum that iteratively prioritizes trajectories that are both teacher-reliable and maximally informative for the student, thereby improving training efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that Video-OPD consistently outperforms GRPO while achieving substantially faster convergence and lower computational cost, establishing on-policy distillation as an effective alternative to conventional reinforcement learning for TVG.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02994v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agent Alpha: Tree Search Unifying Generation, Exploration and Evaluation for Computer-Use Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02995</link><description>arXiv:2602.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While scaling test-time compute through trajectory-level sampling has significantly improved Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, the lack of regressive ability prevents the reuse of partial successes and the recovery from early missteps. In this paper, we introduce Agent Alpha, a unified framework that synergizes generation, exploration, and evaluation through step-level Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It enables active modeling or exploiting structures of the planning space. By integrating alpha-UCT guided search into the interaction loop, Agent Alpha enables deliberate planning, facilitating early pruning of suboptimal branches and efficient prefix reuse. We also employ comparison-driven evaluation to mitigate absolute scoring biases and diversity-constrained expansion to maintain a compact, informative search space. Regret bound of alpha-UCT is analyzed. On the OSWorld benchmark, Agent Alpha achieves a state-of-the-art success rate of $\sim 77\%$, significantly outperforming trajectory-level baselines under equivalent compute.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02995v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ResQ: Realistic Performance-Aware Query Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02999</link><description>arXiv:2602.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Database research and development rely heavily on realistic user workloads for benchmarking, instance optimization, migration testing, and database tuning. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is notoriously challenging due to strict privacy regulations. While cloud database vendors have begun releasing anonymized performance traces to the research community, these traces typi- cally provide only high-level execution statistics without the origi- nal query text or data, which is insufficient for scenarios that require actual execution. Existing tools fail to capture fine-grained perfor- mance patterns or generate runnable workloads that reproduce these public traces with both high fidelity and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose ResQ, a fine-grained workload synthesis sys- tem designed to generate executable SQL workloads that faithfully match the per-query execution targets and operator distributions of production traces. ResQ constructs execution-aware query graphs, instantiates them into SQL via Bayesian Optimization-driven pred- icate search, and explicitly models workload repetition through reuse at both exact-query and parameterized-template levels. To ensure practical scalability, ResQ combines search-space bounding with lightweight local cost models to accelerate optimization. Ex- periments on public cloud traces (Snowset, Redset) and a newly released industrial trace (Bendset) demonstrate that ResQ signif- icantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 96.71% token savings and a 86.97% reduction in runtime, while lowering maximum Q-error by 14.8x on CPU time and 997.7x on scanned bytes, and closely matching operator composition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02999v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Batch Sizes Using Non-Euclidean Gradient Noise Scales for Stochastic Sign and Spectral Descent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03001</link><description>arXiv:2602.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To maximize hardware utilization, modern machine learning systems typically employ large constant or manually tuned batch size schedules, relying on heuristics that are brittle and costly to tune. Existing adaptive strategies based on gradient noise scale (GNS) offer a principled alternative. However, their assumption of SGD's Euclidean geometry creates a fundamental mismatch with popular optimizers based on generalized norms, such as signSGD / Signum ($\ell_\infty$) and stochastic spectral descent (specSGD) / Muon ($\mathcal{S}_\infty$). In this work, we derive gradient noise scales for signSGD and specSGD that naturally emerge from the geometry of their respective dual norms. To practically estimate these non-Euclidean metrics, we propose an efficient variance estimation procedure that leverages the local mini-batch gradients on different ranks in distributed data-parallel systems. Our experiments demonstrate that adaptive batch size strategies using non-Euclidean GNS enable us to match the validation loss of constant-batch baselines while reducing training steps by up to 66% for Signum and Muon on a 160 million parameter Llama model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RPL: Learning Robust Humanoid Perceptive Locomotion on Challenging Terrains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03002</link><description>arXiv:2602.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid perceptive locomotion has made significant progress and shows great promise, yet achieving robust multi-directional locomotion on complex terrains remains underexplored. To tackle this challenge, we propose RPL, a two-stage training framework that enables multi-directional locomotion on challenging terrains, and remains robust with payloads. RPL first trains terrain-specific expert policies with privileged height map observations to master decoupled locomotion and manipulation skills across different terrains, and then distills them into a transformer policy that leverages multiple depth cameras to cover a wide range of views. During distillation, we introduce two techniques to robustify multi-directional locomotion, depth feature scaling based on velocity commands and random side masking, which are critical for asymmetric depth observations and unseen widths of terrains. For scalable depth distillation, we develop an efficient multi-depth system that ray-casts against both dynamic robot meshes and static terrain meshes in massively parallel environments, achieving a 5-times speedup over the depth rendering pipelines in existing simulators while modeling realistic sensor latency, noise, and dropout. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate robust multi-directional locomotion with payloads (2kg) across challenging terrains, including 20{\deg} slopes, staircases with different step lengths (22 cm, 25 cm, 30 cm), and 25 cm by 25 cm stepping stones separated by 60 cm gaps.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03002v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Methods and Open Problems in Differentiable Social Choice: Learning Mechanisms, Decisions, and Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03003</link><description>arXiv:2602.03003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social choice is no longer a peripheral concern of political theory or economics-it has become a foundational component of modern machine learning systems. From auctions and resource allocation to federated learning, participatory governance, and the alignment of large language models, machine learning pipelines increasingly aggregate heterogeneous preferences, incentives, and judgments into collective decisions. In effect, many contemporary machine learning systems already implement social choice mechanisms, often implicitly and without explicit normative scrutiny.
  This Review surveys differentiable social choice: an emerging paradigm that formulates voting rules, mechanisms, and aggregation procedures as learnable, differentiable models optimized from data. We synthesize work across auctions, voting, budgeting, liquid democracy, decentralized aggregation, and inverse mechanism learning, showing how classical axioms and impossibility results reappear as objectives, constraints, and optimization trade-offs. We conclude by identifying 36 open problems defining a new research agenda at the intersection of machine learning, economics, and democratic theory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03003v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder for Reliable and Interpretable Process Monitoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03004</link><description>arXiv:2602.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve the reliability and interpretability of industrial process monitoring, this article proposes a Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder (CGSTAE). The network architecture of CGSTAE combines two components: a correlation graph structure learning module based on spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder module utilizing graph convolutional long-short term memory (GCLSTM). The SSAM learns correlation graphs by capturing dynamic relationships between variables, while a novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm is introduced to derive a causal graph from these correlation graphs. The algorithm leverages a reverse perspective of causal invariance principle to uncover the invariant causal graph from varying correlations. The spatial-temporal encoder-decoder, built with GCLSTM units, reconstructs time-series process data within a sequence-to-sequence framework. The proposed CGSTAE enables effective process monitoring and fault detection through two statistics in the feature space and residual space. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of CGSTAE in process monitoring through the Tennessee Eastman process and a real-world air separation process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03004v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distilling LLM Reasoning into Graph of Concept Predictors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03006</link><description>arXiv:2602.03006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for discriminative workloads is often limited by inference latency, compute, and API costs at scale. Active distillation reduces these costs by querying an LLM oracle to train compact discriminative students, but most pipelines distill only final labels, discarding intermediate reasoning signals and offering limited diagnostics of what reasoning is missing and where errors arise. We propose Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP), a reasoning-aware active distillation framework that externalizes the teacher's decision process as a directed acyclic graph and mirrors it with modular concept predictors in the student. GCP enhances sample efficiency through a graph-aware acquisition strategy that targets uncertainty and disagreement at critical reasoning nodes. Additionally, it improves training stability and efficiency by performing targeted sub-module retraining, which attributes downstream loss to specific concept predictors and updates only the most influential modules. Experiments on eight NLP classification benchmarks demonstrate that GCP enhances performance under limited annotation budgets while yielding more interpretable and controllable training dynamics.

Abstract: Despite significant costs from retrieving and processing high-fidelity visual inputs, most multimodal vision-language systems operate at fixed fidelity levels. We introduce VOILA, a framework for Value-Of-Information-driven adaptive fidelity selection in Visual Question Answering (VQA) that optimizes what information to retrieve before model execution. Given a query, VOILA uses a two-stage pipeline: a gradient-boosted regressor estimates correctness likelihood at each fidelity from question features alone, then an isotonic calibrator refines these probabilities for reliable decision-making. The system selects the minimum-cost fidelity maximizing expected utility given predicted accuracy and retrieval costs. We evaluate VOILA across three deployment scenarios using five datasets (VQA-v2, GQA, TextVQA, LoCoMo, FloodNet) and six Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with 7B-235B parameters. VOILA consistently achieves 50-60% cost reductions while retaining 90-95% of full-resolution accuracy across diverse query types and model architectures, demonstrating that pre-retrieval fidelity selection is vital to optimize multimodal inference under resource constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CVE-Factory: Scaling Expert-Level Agentic Tasks for Code Security Vulnerability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03012</link><description>arXiv:2602.03012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating and improving the security capabilities of code agents requires high-quality, executable vulnerability tasks. However, existing works rely on costly, unscalable manual reproduction and suffer from outdated data distributions. To address these, we present CVE-Factory, the first multi-agent framework to achieve expert-level quality in automatically transforming sparse CVE metadata into fully executable agentic tasks. Cross-validation against human expert reproductions shows that CVE-Factory achieves 95\% solution correctness and 96\% environment fidelity, confirming its expert-level quality. It is also evaluated on the latest realistic vulnerabilities and achieves a 66.2\% verified success. This automation enables two downstream contributions. First, we construct LiveCVEBench, a continuously updated benchmark of 190 tasks spanning 14 languages and 153 repositories that captures emerging threats including AI-tooling vulnerabilities. Second, we synthesize over 1,000 executable training environments, the first large-scale scaling of agentic tasks in code security. Fine-tuned Qwen3-32B improves from 5.3\% to 35.8\% on LiveCVEBench, surpassing Claude 4.5 Sonnet, with gains generalizing to Terminal Bench (12.5\% to 31.3\%). We open-source CVE-Factory, LiveCVEBench, Abacus-cve (fine-tuned model), training dataset, and leaderboard.

Abstract: Image inpainting has earned substantial progress, owing to the encoder-and-decoder pipeline, which is benefited from the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with convolutional downsampling to inpaint the masked regions semantically from the known regions within the encoder, coupled with an upsampling process from the decoder for final inpainting output. Recent studies intuitively identify the high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture to be extracted by CNNs from the encoder, and subsequently for a desirable upsampling recovery. However, the existing arts inevitably overlook the information loss for both structure and texture feature maps during the convolutional downsampling process, hence suffer from a non-ideal upsampling output. In this paper, we systematically answer whether and how the structure and texture feature map can mutually help to alleviate the information loss during the convolutional downsampling. Given the structure and texture feature maps, we adopt the statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for the reconstruction guidance during the convolutional downsampling process. The extensive experimental results validate its advantages to the state-of-the-arts over the images from low-to-high resolutions including 256*256 and 512*512, especially holds by substituting all the encoders by ours.

Abstract: Although socializing is a powerful driver of youth engagement online, platforms struggle to leverage engagement to promote learning. We seek to understand this dynamic using a multi-stage analysis of over 14,000 comments on Scratch, an online platform designed to support learning about programming. First, we inductively develop the concept of "participatory debugging" -- a practice through which users learn through collaborative technical troubleshooting. Second, we use a content analysis to establish how common the practice is on Scratch. Third, we conduct a qualitative analysis of user activity over time and identify three factors that serve as social antecedents of participatory debugging: (1) sustained community, (2) identifiable problems, and (3) what we call "topic porousness" to describe conversations that are able to span multiple topics. We integrate these findings in a theoretical framework that highlights a productive tension between the desire to promote learning and the interest-driven sub-communities that drive user engagement in many new media environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03017v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Zero to Hero: Advancing Zero-Shot Foundation Models for Tabular Outlier Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03018</link><description>arXiv:2602.03018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) is widely used in practice; but its effective deployment on new tasks is hindered by lack of labeled outliers, which makes algorithm and hyperparameter selection notoriously hard. Foundation models (FMs) have transformed ML, and OD is no exception: Shen et. al. (2025) introduced FoMo-0D, the first FM for OD, achieving remarkable performance against numerous baselines. This work introduces OUTFORMER, which advances FoMo-0D with (1) a mixture of synthetic priors and (2) self-evolving curriculum training. OUTFORMER is pretrained solely on synthetic labeled datasets and infers test labels of a new task by using its training data as in-context input. Inference is fast and zero-shot, requiring merely forward pass and no labeled outliers. Thanks to in-context learning, it requires zero additional work-no OD model training or bespoke model selection-enabling truly plug-and-play deployment. OUTFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the prominent AdBench, as well as two new large-scale OD benchmarks that we introduce, comprising over 1,500 datasets, while maintaining speedy inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FedKRSO: Communication and Memory Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03019</link><description>arXiv:2602.03019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning is essential to adapt general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific tasks. As a privacy-preserving framework to leverage decentralized data for collaborative model training, Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity in LLM fine-tuning, but remains challenging due to the high cost of transmitting full model parameters and computing full gradients on resource-constrained clients. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used in FL to reduce communication and memory costs, they often sacrifice model performance compared to FFT. This paper proposes FedKRSO (Federated $K$-Seed Random Subspace Optimization), a novel method that enables communication and memory efficient FFT of LLMs in federated settings. In FedKRSO, clients update the model within a shared set of random low-dimension subspaces generated by the server to save memory usage. Furthermore, instead of transmitting full model parameters in each FL round, clients send only the model update accumulators along the subspaces to the server, enabling efficient global model aggregation and dissemination. By using these strategies, FedKRSO can substantially reduce communication and memory overhead while overcoming the performance limitations of PEFT, closely approximating the performance of federated FFT. The convergence properties of FedKRSO are analyzed rigorously under general FL settings. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark across diverse FL scenarios demonstrate that FedKRSO achieves both superior performance and low communication and memory overhead, paving the way towards on federated LLM fine-tuning at the resource-constrained edge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast Diffusion with Physics-Correction for ACOPF</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03020</link><description>arXiv:2602.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating large-scale, physically consistent AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) datasets is essential for modern data-driven power system applications. The central challenge lies in balancing solution accuracy with computational efficiency. Recent diffusion-based generative models produce high-quality samples; however, their slow sampling procedures limit practical scalability. In this work, we argue that exact physical feasibility is ultimately enforced by power flow solvers or projection steps, and therefore the generative model only needs to produce good initializations rather than perfectly feasible solutions. Based on this insight, we propose a fast diffusion framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) combined with physics-guided corrections during sampling. The proposed method replaces slow stochastic refinement with a small number of deterministic steps and explicit constraint guidance. Experiments on IEEE 6-, 24-, and 118-bus systems show that our approach achieves up to 20 times faster sampling than standard diffusion models while maintaining comparable statistical accuracy and physical consistency. This makes the method well suited for scalable OPF dataset generation and practical power system learning tasks. We release the implementation code at https://github.com/PSquare-Lab/DDIM_OPF.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03020v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement for Super-Tiny Function Calling Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03022</link><description>arXiv:2602.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in function calling is pivotal for creating advanced AI agents, yet their large scale hinders widespread adoption, necessitating transferring their capabilities into smaller ones. However, existing paradigms are often plagued by overfitting, training instability, ineffective binary rewards for multi-solution tasks, and the difficulty of synergizing techniques. We introduce STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement, a novel holistic framework that effectively transfers LLMs' capabilities to super-tiny models. STAR consists of two core technical innovations: (1) Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD), a training objective that augments top-k forward KL divergence to suppress confidently incorrect predictions, ensuring training stability while preserving exploration capacity for downstream RL. STAR holistically synergizes these strategies within a cohesive training curriculum, enabling super-tiny models to achieve exceptional performance on complex function calling tasks; (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL), a RL mechanism that introduces a fine-grained, similarity-based reward. This provides a robust, continuous, and rich signal for better policy optimization by evaluating the similarity between generated outputs and the ground truth. Extensive experiments on challenging and renowned benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our STAR models establish SOTA in their size classes, significantly outperforming baselines. Remarkably, our 0.6B STAR model achieves the best performance among all open models under 1B, surpassing even several well-known open models at a larger scale. STAR demonstrates a training framework that distills capabilities of LLMs into super-tiny models, paving the way for powerful, accessible, and efficient AI agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03022v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Music Captioning with Music Metadata LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03023</link><description>arXiv:2602.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music captioning, or the task of generating a natural language description of music, is useful for both music understanding and controllable music generation. Training captioning models, however, typically requires high-quality music caption data which is scarce compared to metadata (e.g., genre, mood, etc.). As a result, it is common to use large language models (LLMs) to synthesize captions from metadata to generate training data for captioning models, though this process imposes a fixed stylization and entangles factual information with natural language style. As a more direct approach, we propose metadata-based captioning. We train a metadata prediction model to infer detailed music metadata from audio and then convert it into expressive captions via pre-trained LLMs at inference time. Compared to a strong end-to-end baseline trained on LLM-generated captions derived from metadata, our method: (1) achieves comparable performance in less training time over end-to-end captioners, (2) offers flexibility to easily change stylization post-training, enabling output captions to be tailored to specific stylistic and quality requirements, and (3) can be prompted with audio and partial metadata to enable powerful metadata imputation or in-filling--a common task for organizing music data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03023v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Consistency Deep Equilibrium Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03024</link><description>arXiv:2602.03024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning, offering the ability to model infinite-depth networks with constant memory usage. However, DEQs incur significant inference latency due to the iterative nature of fixed-point solvers. In this work, we introduce the Consistency Deep Equilibrium Model (C-DEQ), a novel framework that leverages consistency distillation to accelerate DEQ inference. We cast the DEQ iterative inference process as evolution along a fixed ODE trajectory toward the equilibrium. Along this trajectory, we train C-DEQs to consistently map intermediate states directly to the fixed point, enabling few-step inference while preserving the performance of the teacher DEQ. At the same time, it facilitates multi-step evaluation to flexibly trade computation for performance gains. Extensive experiments across various domain tasks demonstrate that C-DEQs achieves consistent 2-20$\times$ accuracy improvements over implicit DEQs under the same few-step inference budget.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03024v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RC-GRPO: Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization for Multi-Turn Tool Calling Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03025</link><description>arXiv:2602.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-turn tool calling is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) because rewards are sparse and exploration is expensive. A common recipe, SFT followed by GRPO, can stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., more rollouts in a group receive the all 0 or all 1 reward), making the group-normalized advantage uninformative and yielding vanishing updates. To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., &lt;|high_reward|&gt;, &lt;|low_reward|&gt;) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand. Then during RL, we sample diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group and condition rollouts on the sampled token to improve within-group diversity, improving advantage gains.

To address these limitations, we propose MAS4TS, a tool-driven multi-agent system for general time series tasks, built upon an Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor paradigm that integrates agent communication, visual reasoning, and latent reconstruction within a unified framework. MAS4TS first performs visual reasoning over time series plots with structured priors using a Vision-Language Model to extract temporal structures, and subsequently reconstructs predictive trajectories in latent space. Three specialized agents coordinate via shared memory and gated communication, while a router selects task-specific tool chains for execution. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MAS4TS achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series tasks, while exhibiting strong generalization and efficient inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MUSE: A Multi-agent Framework for Unconstrained Story Envisioning via Closed-Loop Cognitive Orchestration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03028</link><description>arXiv:2602.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating long-form audio-visual stories from a short user prompt remains challenging due to an intent-execution gap, where high-level narrative intent must be preserved across coherent, shot-level multimodal generation over long horizons. Existing approaches typically rely on feed-forward pipelines or prompt-only refinement, which often leads to semantic drift and identity inconsistency as sequences grow longer. We address this challenge by formulating storytelling as a closed-loop constraint enforcement problem and propose MUSE, a multi-agent framework that coordinates generation through an iterative plan-execute-verify-revise loop. MUSE translates narrative intent into explicit, machine-executable controls over identity, spatial composition, and temporal continuity, and applies targeted multimodal feedback to correct violations during generation. To evaluate open-ended storytelling without ground-truth references, we introduce MUSEBench, a reference-free evaluation protocol validated by human judgments. Experiments demonstrate that MUSE substantially improves long-horizon narrative coherence, cross-modal identity consistency, and cinematic quality compared with representative baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03028v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KANFIS A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Interpretable and Uncertainty-Aware Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03034</link><description>arXiv:2602.03034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was designed to combine the learning capabilities of neural network with the reasoning transparency of fuzzy logic. However, conventional ANFIS architectures suffer from structural complexity, where the product-based inference mechanism causes an exponential explosion of rules in high-dimensional spaces. We herein propose the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (KANFIS), a compact neuro-symbolic architecture that unifies fuzzy reasoning with additive function decomposition. KANFIS employs an additive aggregation mechanism, under which both model parameters and rule complexity scale linearly with input dimensionality rather than exponentially. Furthermore, KANFIS is compatible with both Type-1 (T1) and Interval Type-2 (IT2) fuzzy logic systems, enabling explicit modeling of uncertainty and ambiguity in fuzzy representations. By using sparse masking mechanisms, KANFIS generates compact and structured rule sets, resulting in an intrinsically interpretable model with clear rule semantics and transparent inference processes. Empirical results demonstrate that KANFIS achieves competitive performance against representative neural and neuro-fuzzy baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03034v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalizable and Interpretable RF Fingerprinting with Shapelet-Enhanced Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03035</link><description>arXiv:2602.03035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting for wireless device authentication. However, their practical deployment faces two major limitations: domain shift, where models trained in one environment struggle to generalize to others, and the black-box nature of DNNs, which limits interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates a group of variable-length two-dimensional (2D) shapelets with a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to achieve efficient, interpretable, and generalizable RF fingerprinting. The 2D shapelets explicitly capture diverse local temporal patterns across the in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components, providing compact and interpretable representations. Complementarily, the pre-trained LLM captures more long-range dependencies and global contextual information, enabling strong generalization with minimal training overhead. Moreover, our framework also supports prototype generation for few-shot inference, enhancing cross-domain performance without additional retraining. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on six datasets across various protocols and domains. The results show that our method achieves superior standard and few-shot performance across both source and unseen domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03035v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LatentMem: Customizing Latent Memory for Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03036</link><description>arXiv:2602.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable collective intelligence, wherein multi-agent memory serves as a pivotal mechanism for continual adaptation. However, existing multi-agent memory designs remain constrained by two fundamental bottlenecks: (i) memory homogenization arising from the absence of role-aware customization, and (ii) information overload induced by excessively fine-grained memory entries. To address these limitations, we propose LatentMem, a learnable multi-agent memory framework designed to customize agent-specific memories in a token-efficient manner. Specifically, LatentMem comprises an experience bank that stores raw interaction trajectories in a lightweight form, and a memory composer that synthesizes compact latent memories conditioned on retrieved experience and agent-specific contexts. Further, we introduce Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO), which propagates task-level optimization signals through latent memories to the composer, encouraging it to produce compact and high-utility representations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and mainstream MAS frameworks show that LatentMem achieves a performance gain of up to $19.36$% over vanilla settings and consistently outperforms existing memory architectures, without requiring any modifications to the underlying frameworks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03036v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bongards at the Boundary of Perception and Reasoning: Programs or Language?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03038</link><description>arXiv:2602.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made great strides in everyday visual tasks, such as captioning a natural image, or answering commonsense questions about such images. But humans possess the puzzling ability to deploy their visual reasoning abilities in radically new situations, a skill rigorously tested by the classic set of visual reasoning challenges known as the Bongard problems. We present a neurosymbolic approach to solving these problems: given a hypothesized solution rule for a Bongard problem, we leverage LLMs to generate parameterized programmatic representations for the rule and perform parameter fitting using Bayesian optimization. We evaluate our method on classifying Bongard problem images given the ground truth rule, as well as on solving the problems from scratch.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03038v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HP-GAN: Harnessing pretrained networks for GAN improvement with FakeTwins and discriminator consistency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03039</link><description>arXiv:2602.03039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made significant progress in enhancing the quality of image synthesis. Recent methods frequently leverage pretrained networks to calculate perceptual losses or utilize pretrained feature spaces. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of pretrained networks by incorporating innovative self-supervised learning techniques and enforcing consistency between discriminators during GAN training. Our proposed method, named HP-GAN, effectively exploits neural network priors through two primary strategies: FakeTwins and discriminator consistency. FakeTwins leverages pretrained networks as encoders to compute a self-supervised loss and applies this through the generated images to train the generator, thereby enabling the generation of more diverse and high quality images. Additionally, we introduce a consistency mechanism between discriminators that evaluate feature maps extracted from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) feature networks. Discriminator consistency promotes coherent learning among discriminators and enhances training robustness by aligning their assessments of image quality. Our extensive evaluation across seventeen datasets-including scenarios with large, small, and limited data, and covering a variety of image domains-demonstrates that HP-GAN consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), achieving significant improvements in image diversity and quality.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Vision Transformers (ViTs) elevates supply-chain risk on third-party model hubs, where an adversary can implant backdoors into released checkpoints. Existing ViT backdoor attacks largely rely on poisoned-data training, while prior data-free attempts typically require synthetic-data fine-tuning or extra model components. This paper introduces Data-Free Logic-Gated Backdoor Attacks (DF-LoGiT), a truly data-free backdoor attack on ViTs via direct weight editing. DF-LoGiT exploits ViT's native multi-head architecture to realize a logic-gated compositional trigger, enabling a stealthy and effective backdoor. We validate its effectiveness through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, showing that DF-LoGiT achieves near-100% attack success with negligible degradation in benign accuracy and remains robust against representative classical and ViT-specific defenses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03040v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAFE-KD: Risk-Controlled Early-Exit Distillation for Vision Backbones</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03043</link><description>arXiv:2602.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-exit networks reduce inference cost by allowing ``easy'' inputs to stop early, but practical deployment hinges on knowing \emph{when} early exit is safe. We introduce SAFE-KD, a universal multi-exit wrapper for modern vision backbones that couples hierarchical distillation with \emph{conformal risk control}. SAFE-KD attaches lightweight exit heads at intermediate depths, distills a strong teacher into all exits via Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), and enforces deep-to-shallow consistency between exits. At inference, we calibrate per-exit stopping thresholds on a held-out set using conformal risk control (CRC) to guarantee a user-specified \emph{selective} misclassification risk (among the samples that exit early) under exchangeability. Across multiple datasets and architectures, SAFE-KD yields improved accuracy compute trade-offs, stronger calibration, and robust performance under corruption while providing finite-sample risk guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03043v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Clarify Before You Draw: Proactive Agents for Robust Text-to-CAD Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03045</link><description>arXiv:2602.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have recently enabled text-to-CAD systems that synthesize parametric CAD programs (e.g., CadQuery) from natural language prompts. In practice, however, geometric descriptions can be under-specified or internally inconsistent: critical dimensions may be missing and constraints may conflict. Existing fine-tuned models tend to reactively follow user instructions and hallucinate dimensions when the text is ambiguous. To address this, we propose a proactive agentic framework for text-to-CadQuery generation, named ProCAD, that resolves specification issues before code synthesis. Our framework pairs a proactive clarifying agent, which audits the prompt and asks targeted clarification questions only when necessary to produce a self-consistent specification, with a CAD coding agent that translates the specification into an executable CadQuery program. We fine-tune the coding agent on a curated high-quality text-to-CadQuery dataset and train the clarifying agent via agentic SFT on clarification trajectories. Experiments show that proactive clarification significantly improves robustness to ambiguous prompts while keeping interaction overhead low. ProCAD outperforms frontier closed-source models, including Claude Sonnet 4.5, reducing the mean Chamfer distance by 79.9 percent and lowering the invalidity ratio from 4.8 percent to 0.9 percent. Our code and datasets will be made publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03045v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoBA-RL: Capability-Oriented Budget Allocation for Reinforcement Learning in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03048</link><description>arXiv:2602.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key approach for enhancing LLM reasoning.However, standard frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) typically employ a uniform rollout budget, leading to resource inefficiency. Moreover, existing adaptive methods often rely on instance-level metrics, such as task pass rates, failing to capture the model's dynamic learning state. To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the model's evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively orchestrates the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, delivering consistent generalization improvements across multiple challenging benchmarks. These findings underscore that quantifying sample training value and optimizing budget allocation are pivotal for advancing LLM post-training efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAES-SVD: Self-Adaptive Suppression of Accumulated and Local Errors for SVD-based LLM Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03051</link><description>arXiv:2602.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth in the parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has created a high demand for efficient compression techniques. As a hardware-agnostic and highly compatible technique, low-rank compression has been widely adopted. However, existing methods typically compress each layer independently by minimizing per-layer reconstruction error, overlooking a critical limitation: the reconstruction error propagates and accumulates through the network, which leads to amplified global deviations from the full-precision baseline. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Error Suppression SVD (SAES-SVD), a LLMs compression framework that jointly optimizes intra-layer reconstruction and inter-layer error compensation. SAES-SVD is composed of two novel components: (1) Cumulative Error-Aware Layer Compression (CEALC), which formulates the compression objective as a combination of local reconstruction and weighted cumulative error compensation. Based on it, we derive a closed-form low-rank solution relied on second-order activation statistics, which explicitly aligns each layer's output with its full-precision counterpart to compensate for accumulated errors. (2) Adaptive Collaborative Error Suppression (ACES), which automatically adjusts the weighting coefficient to enhance the low-rank structure of the compression objective in CEALC. Specifically, the coefficient is optimized to maximize the ratio between the Frobenius norm of the compressed layer's output and that of the compression objective under a fixed rank, thus ensuring that the rank budget is utilized effectively. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures and tasks show that, without fine-tuning or mixed-rank strategies, SAES-SVD consistently improves post-compression performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03051v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MAS-ProVe: Understanding the Process Verification of Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03053</link><description>arXiv:2602.03053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit high variance in their reasoning trajectories. Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

Abstract: Co-design is essential for grounding embodied artificial intelligence (AI) systems in real-world contexts, especially high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While prior work has explored multidisciplinary collaboration, iterative prototyping, and support for non-technical participants, few have interwoven these into a sustained co-design process. Such efforts often target one context and low-fidelity stages, limiting the generalizability of findings and obscuring how participants' ideas evolve. To address these limitations, we conducted a 14-week workshop with a multidisciplinary team of 22 participants, centered around how embodied AI can reduce non-value-added task burdens in three healthcare settings: emergency departments, long-term rehabilitation facilities, and sleep disorder clinics. We found that the iterative progression from abstract brainstorming to high-fidelity prototypes, supported by educational scaffolds, enabled participants to understand real-world trade-offs and generate more deployable solutions. We propose eight guidelines for co-designing more considerate embodied AI: attuned to context, responsive to social dynamics, mindful of expectations, and grounded in deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have highlighted their potential for personalized recommendation, where accurately capturing user preferences remains a key challenge. Leveraging their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs offer new opportunities for modeling long-term user behavior. To systematically evaluate this, we introduce ALPBench, a Benchmark for Attribution-level Long-term Personal Behavior Understanding. Unlike item-focused benchmarks, ALPBench predicts user-interested attribute combinations, enabling ground-truth evaluation even for newly introduced items. It models preferences from long-term historical behaviors rather than users' explicitly expressed requests, better reflecting enduring interests. User histories are represented as natural language sequences, allowing interpretable, reasoning-based personalization. ALPBench enables fine-grained evaluation of personalization by focusing on the prediction of attribute combinations task that remains highly challenging for current LLMs due to the need to capture complex interactions among multiple attributes and reason over long-term user behavior sequences.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03056v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Speech-to-Spatial: Grounding Utterances on A Live Shared View with Augmented Reality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03059</link><description>arXiv:2602.03059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Speech-to-Spatial, a referent disambiguation framework that converts verbal remote-assistance instructions into spatially grounded AR guidance. Unlike prior systems that rely on additional cues (e.g., gesture, gaze) or manual expert annotations, Speech-to-Spatial infers the intended target solely from spoken references (speech input). Motivated by our formative study of speech referencing patterns, we characterize recurring ways people specify targets (Direct Attribute, Relational, Remembrance, and Chained) and ground them to our object-centric relational graph. Given an utterance, referent cues are parsed and rendered as persistent in-situ AR visual guidance, reducing iterative micro-guidance ("a bit more to the right", "now, stop.") during remote guidance. We demonstrate the use cases of our system with remote guided assistance and intent disambiguation scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Speechto-Spatial improves task efficiency, reduces cognitive load, and enhances usability compared to a conventional voice-only baseline, transforming disembodied verbal instruction into visually explainable, actionable guidance on a live shared view.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03059v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IVC-Prune: Revealing the Implicit Visual Coordinates in LVLMs for Vision Token Pruning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03060</link><description>arXiv:2602.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance across multiple tasks. A significant challenge, however, is their prohibitive inference cost when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods that primarily focus on semantic relevance often discard tokens that are crucial for spatial reasoning. We address this gap through a novel insight into \emph{how LVLMs process spatial reasoning}. Specifically, we reveal that LVLMs implicitly establish visual coordinate systems through Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), where specific token positions serve as \textbf{implicit visual coordinates} (IVC tokens) that are essential for spatial reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{IVC-Prune}, a training-free, prompt-aware pruning strategy that retains both IVC tokens and semantically relevant foreground tokens. IVC tokens are identified by theoretically analyzing the mathematical properties of RoPE, targeting positions at which its rotation matrices approximate identity matrix or the $90^\circ$ rotation matrix. Foreground tokens are identified through a robust two-stage process: semantic seed discovery followed by contextual refinement via value-vector similarity. Extensive evaluations across four representative LVLMs and twenty diverse benchmarks show that IVC-Prune reduces visual tokens by approximately 50\% while maintaining $\geq$ 99\% of the original performance and even achieving improvements on several benchmarks. Source codes are available at https://github.com/FireRedTeam/IVC-Prune.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03060v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating LLMs When They Do Not Know the Answer: Statistical Evaluation of Mathematical Reasoning via Comparative Signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03061</link><description>arXiv:2602.03061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating mathematical reasoning in LLMs is constrained by limited benchmark sizes and inherent model stochasticity, yielding high-variance accuracy estimates and unstable rankings across platforms. On difficult problems, an LLM may fail to produce a correct final answer, yet still provide reliable pairwise comparison signals indicating which of two candidate solutions is better. We leverage this observation to design a statistically efficient evaluation framework that combines standard labeled outcomes with pairwise comparison signals obtained by having models judge auxiliary reasoning chains. Treating these comparison signals as control variates, we develop a semiparametric estimator based on the efficient influence function (EIF) for the setting where auxiliary reasoning chains are observed. This yields a one-step estimator that achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound, guarantees strict variance reduction over naive sample averaging, and admits asymptotic normality for principled uncertainty quantification. Across simulations, our one-step estimator substantially improves ranking accuracy, with gains increasing as model output noise grows. Experiments on GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025, and GSM8K further demonstrate more precise performance estimation and more reliable model rankings, especially in small-sample regimes where conventional evaluation is pretty unstable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03061v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] JRDB-Pose3D: A Multi-person 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation Dataset for Robotics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03064</link><description>arXiv:2602.03064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world scenes are inherently crowded. Hence, estimating 3D poses of all nearby humans, tracking their movements over time, and understanding their activities within social and environmental contexts are essential for many applications, such as autonomous driving, robot perception, robot navigation, and human-robot interaction. However, most existing 3D human pose estimation datasets primarily focus on single-person scenes or are collected in controlled laboratory environments, which restricts their relevance to real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce JRDB-Pose3D, which captures multi-human indoor and outdoor environments from a mobile robotic platform. JRDB-Pose3D provides rich 3D human pose annotations for such complex and dynamic scenes, including SMPL-based pose annotations with consistent body-shape parameters and track IDs for each individual over time. JRDB-Pose3D contains, on average, 5-10 human poses per frame, with some scenes featuring up to 35 individuals simultaneously. The proposed dataset presents unique challenges, including frequent occlusions, truncated bodies, and out-of-frame body parts, which closely reflect real-world environments. Moreover, JRDB-Pose3D inherits all available annotations from the JRDB dataset, such as 2D pose, information about social grouping, activities, and interactions, full-scene semantic masks with consistent human- and object-level tracking, and detailed annotations for each individual, such as age, gender, and race, making it a holistic dataset for a wide range of downstream perception and human-centric understanding tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Shortcut Features as Top Eigenfunctions of NTK: A Linear Neural Network Case and More</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03066</link><description>arXiv:2602.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the chronic problems of deep-learning models is shortcut learning. In a case where the majority of training data are dominated by a certain feature, neural networks prefer to learn such a feature even if the feature is not generalizable outside the training set. Based on the framework of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we analyzed the case of linear neural networks to derive some important properties of shortcut learning. We defined a feature of a neural network as an eigenfunction of NTK. Then, we found that shortcut features correspond to features with larger eigenvalues when the shortcuts stem from the imbalanced number of samples in the clustered distribution. We also showed that the features with larger eigenvalues still have a large influence on the neural network output even after training, due to data variances in the clusters. Such a preference for certain features remains even when a margin of a neural network output is controlled, which shows that the max-margin bias is not the only major reason for shortcut learning. These properties of linear neural networks are empirically extended for more complex neural networks as a two-layer fully-connected ReLU network and a ResNet-18.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03066v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlashSinkhorn: IO-Aware Entropic Optimal Transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03067</link><description>arXiv:2602.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport (EOT) via Sinkhorn iterations is widely used in modern machine learning, yet GPU solvers remain inefficient at scale. Tensorized implementations suffer quadratic HBM traffic from dense $n\times m$ interactions, while existing online backends avoid storing dense matrices but still rely on generic tiled map-reduce reduction kernels with limited fusion. We present \textbf{FlashSinkhorn}, an IO-aware EOT solver for squared Euclidean cost that rewrites stabilized log-domain Sinkhorn updates as row-wise LogSumExp reductions of biased dot-product scores, the same normalization as transformer attention. This enables FlashAttention-style fusion and tiling: fused Triton kernels stream tiles through on-chip SRAM and update dual potentials in a single pass, substantially reducing HBM IO per iteration while retaining linear-memory operations. We further provide streaming kernels for transport application, enabling scalable first- and second-order optimization. On A100 GPUs, FlashSinkhorn achieves up to $32\times$ forward-pass and $161\times$ end-to-end speedups over state-of-the-art online baselines on point-cloud OT, improves scalability on OT-based downstream tasks. For reproducibility, we release an open-source implementation at https://github.com/ot-triton-lab/ot_triton.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From semantic memory to collective creativity: A generative cognitive foundation for social creativity models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03068</link><description>arXiv:2602.03068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based theory development has yielded powerful insights into collective performance by linking social structure to emergent outcomes, yet it has struggled to extend to collective creativity. Creativity is hard to capture purely at the social level, as novel ideas are generated through cognitive mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce a multi-level socio-cognitive agent-based framework in which agents share a common semantic vocabulary and substrate but differ in semantic network topology. A single generative parameter tunes semantic modularity, yielding emergent individual differences in ideational breadth. When agents exchange ideation traces, two canonical social-creativity phenomena arise without being imposed: lower pre-interaction ideation overlap predicts larger stimulation gains, and shared inspiration sources induce network-level redundancy. The framework enables mechanistic theory-building about cognition and social structure in collective creativity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03068v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Skill-Based Autonomous Agents for Material Creep Database Construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03069</link><description>arXiv:2602.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of data-driven materials science is currently constrained by a fundamental bottleneck: the vast majority of historical experimental data remains locked within the unstructured text and rasterized figures of legacy scientific literature. Manual curation of this knowledge is prohibitively labor-intensive and prone to human error. To address this challenge, we introduce an autonomous, agent-based framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) designed to excavate high-fidelity datasets from scientific PDFs without human intervention. By deploying a modular "skill-based" architecture, the agent orchestrates complex cognitive tasks - including semantic filtering, multi-modal information extraction, and physics-informed validation. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework by constructing a physically self-consistent database for material creep mechanics, a domain characterized by complex graphical trajectories and heterogeneous constitutive models. Applying the pipeline to 243 publications, the agent achieved a verified extraction success rate exceeding 90% for graphical data digitization. Crucially, we introduce a cross-modal verification protocol, demonstrating that the agent can autonomously align visually extracted data points with textually extracted constitutive parameters ($R^2 &gt; 0.99$), ensuring the physical self-consistency of the database. This work not only provides a critical resource for investigating time-dependent deformation across diverse material systems but also establishes a scalable paradigm for autonomous knowledge acquisition, paving the way for the next generation of self-driving laboratories.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03069v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProOPF: Benchmarking and Improving LLMs for Professional-Grade Power Systems Optimization Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03070</link><description>arXiv:2602.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing renewable penetration introduces substantial uncertainty into power system operations, necessitating frequent adaptation of dispatch objectives and constraints and challenging expertise-intensive, near-real-time modeling workflows. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for automating this process by translating natural-language (NL) operational requirements into executable optimization models via semantic reasoning and code synthesis. Yet existing LLM datasets and benchmarks for optimization modeling primarily target coarse-grained cross-domain generalization, offering limited, rigorous evaluation in power-system settings, particularly for Optimal Power Flow (OPF). We therefore introduce \textbf{ProOPF-D} and \textbf{ProOPF-B}, a dataset and benchmark for professional-grade OPF modeling: ProOPF-D contains 12K instances pairing NL requests with parameter adjustments and structural extensions to a canonical OPF, together with executable implementations; ProOPF-B provides 121 expert-annotated test cases with ground-truth code, enabling end-to-end evaluation under both concrete and abstract OPF modeling regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03070v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Finding Optimal Video Moment without Training: Gaussian Boundary Optimization for Weakly Supervised Video Grounding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03071</link><description>arXiv:2602.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal video grounding aims to localize query-relevant segments in untrimmed videos using only video-sentence pairs, without requiring ground-truth segment annotations that specify exact temporal boundaries. Recent approaches tackle this task by utilizing Gaussian-based temporal proposals to represent query-relevant segments. However, their inference strategies rely on heuristic mappings from Gaussian parameters to segment boundaries, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a novel inference framework that predicts segment boundaries by solving a principled optimization problem that balances proposal coverage and segment compactness. We derive a closed-form solution for this problem and rigorously analyze the optimality conditions under varying penalty regimes. Beyond its theoretical foundations, GBO offers several practical advantages: it is training-free and compatible with both single-Gaussian and mixture-based proposal architectures. Our experiments show that GBO significantly improves localization, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of GBO across various proposal schemes.

Abstract: The logic of definitions is a family of logics for encoding and reasoning about judgments, which are atomic predicates specified by inference rules. A definition associates an atomic predicate with a logical formula, which may itself depend on the predicate being defined. This leads to an apparent circularity which can be resolved by interpreting definitions as monotone fixed-point operators on terms, and which is enforced by imposing a stratification condition on definitions. In many instances, it is useful to consider definitions in which the predicate being defined appears negatively in the body of its definition. In the logic $\mathcal G$, underlying the Abella proof assistant, this is not allowed due to the stratification condition. One such application violating this condition is that of defining logical relations, which is a technique commonly used to prove properties about programming languages. Tiu has shown how to relax this stratification condition to allow for a broader body of definitions including that needed for logical relations. However, he only showed how to extend a core fragment of $\mathcal G$ with the weakened stratification condition, resulting in a logic he called $\mathrm{LD}$. In this work we show that the weakened stratification condition is also compatible with generic (nabla) quantification and general induction. The eventual aim of this work is to justify an extension of the Abella proof assistant allowing for such definitions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03072v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TMS: Trajectory-Mixed Supervision for Reward-Free, On-Policy SFT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03073</link><description>arXiv:2602.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) are the two dominant paradigms for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks. While RL generally preserves broader model capabilities (retention) better than SFT, it comes with significant costs: complex reward engineering, instability, and expensive on-policy sampling. In contrast, SFT is efficient but brittle, often suffering from catastrophic forgetting due to $\textbf{Supervision Mismatch}$: the divergence between the model's evolving policy and static training labels. We address this trade-off with $\textbf{Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS)}$, a reward-free framework that approximates the on-policy benefits of RL by creating a dynamic curriculum from the model's own historical checkpoints. TMS minimizes $\textit{Policy-Label Divergence (PLD)}$, preventing the mode collapse that drives forgetting in standard SFT. Experiments across reasoning (MATH, GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate that TMS effectively shifts the accuracy--retention Pareto frontier. While RL remains the gold standard for retention, TMS significantly outperforms standard and iterative SFT, bridging the gap to RL without requiring reward models or verifiers. Mechanistic analysis confirms that PLD drift accurately predicts forgetting and that TMS successfully mitigates this drift.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03073v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Straggler-Aware Coded Polynomial Aggregation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03074</link><description>arXiv:2602.03074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) in distributed computing systems enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial computations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. However, existing CPA schemes are restricted to an idealized setting in which the system cannot tolerate stragglers. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems with a pre-specified non-straggler pattern, where exact recovery is required for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main results show that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than that required by polynomial codes based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA. We identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. When the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large, we further show that this threshold is necessary in a generic sense. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations verify our theoretical results by demonstrating a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted intersection threshold.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03074v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReMiT: RL-Guided Mid-Training for Iterative LLM Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03075</link><description>arXiv:2602.03075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard training pipelines for large language models (LLMs) are typically unidirectional, progressing from pre-training to post-training. However, the potential for a bidirectional process--where insights from post-training retroactively improve the pre-trained foundation--remains unexplored. We aim to establish a self-reinforcing flywheel: a cycle in which reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned model strengthens the base model, which in turn enhances subsequent post-training performance, requiring no specially trained teacher or reference model. To realize this, we analyze training dynamics and identify the mid-training (annealing) phase as a critical turning point for model capabilities. This phase typically occurs at the end of pre-training, utilizing high-quality corpora under a rapidly decaying learning rate. Building upon this insight, we introduce ReMiT (Reinforcement Learning-Guided Mid-Training). Specifically, ReMiT leverages the reasoning priors of RL-tuned models to dynamically reweight tokens during the mid-training phase, prioritizing those pivotal for reasoning. Empirically, ReMiT achieves an average improvement of 3\% on 10 pre-training benchmarks, spanning math, code, and general reasoning, and sustains these gains by over 2\% throughout the post-training pipeline. These results validate an iterative feedback loop, enabling continuous and self-reinforcing evolution of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03075v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A generalizable large-scale foundation model for musculoskeletal radiographs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03076</link><description>arXiv:2602.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in detecting and characterizing musculoskeletal diseases from radiographs. However, most existing models remain task-specific, annotation-dependent, and limited in generalizability across diseases and anatomical regions. Although a generalizable foundation model trained on large-scale musculoskeletal radiographs is clinically needed, publicly available datasets remain limited in size and lack sufficient diversity to enable training across a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions and anatomical sites. Here, we present SKELEX, a large-scale foundation model for musculoskeletal radiographs, trained using self-supervised learning on 1.2 million diverse, condition-rich images. The model was evaluated on 12 downstream diagnostic tasks and generally outperformed baselines in fracture detection, osteoarthritis grading, and bone tumor classification. Furthermore, SKELEX demonstrated zero-shot abnormality localization, producing error maps that identified pathologic regions without task-specific training. Building on this capability, we developed an interpretable, region-guided model for predicting bone tumors, which maintained robust performance on independent external datasets and was deployed as a publicly accessible web application. Overall, SKELEX provides a scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable AI framework for musculoskeletal imaging, establishing a foundation for both clinical translation and data-efficient research in musculoskeletal radiology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03076v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Optimized Spectral Approximations on Unbounded Domains: The Generalized Hermite and Laguerre Methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03083</link><description>arXiv:2602.03083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel error analysis framework for scaled generalized Laguerre and generalized Hermite approximations.This framework can be regarded as an analogue of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem: It characterizes the spatial and frequency bandwidths that can be effectively captured by Laguerre or Hermite sampling points. Provided a function satisfies the corresponding bandwidth constraints, it can be accurately approximated within this framework. The proposed framework is notably more powerful than classical theory -- it not only provides systematic guidance for choosing the optimal scaling factor, but also predicts root-exponential and other intricate convergence behaviors that classical approaches fail to capture. Leveraging this framework, we conducted a detailed comparative study of Hermite and Laguerre approximations. We find that functions with similar decay and oscillation characteristics may nonetheless display markedly different convergence rates. Furthermore, approximations based on two concatenated sets of Laguerre functions may offer significant advantages over those using a single set of Hermite functions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03083v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AERO: Autonomous Evolutionary Reasoning Optimization via Endogenous Dual-Loop Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03084</link><description>arXiv:2602.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in complex reasoning but remain bottlenecked by reliance on expert-annotated data and external verifiers. While existing self-evolution paradigms aim to bypass these constraints, they often fail to identify the optimal learning zone and risk reinforcing collective hallucinations and incorrect priors through flawed internal feedback. To address these challenges, we propose \underline{A}utonomous \underline{E}volutionary \underline{R}easoning \underline{O}ptimization (AERO), an unsupervised framework that achieves autonomous reasoning evolution by internalizing self-questioning, answering, and criticism within a synergistic dual-loop system. Inspired by the \textit{Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)} theory, AERO utilizes entropy-based positioning to target the ``solvability gap'' and employs Independent Counterfactual Correction for robust verification. Furthermore, we introduce a Staggered Training Strategy to synchronize capability growth across functional roles and prevent curriculum collapse. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmarks spanning three domains demonstrate that AERO achieves average performance improvements of 4.57\% on Qwen3-4B-Base and 5.10\% on Qwen3-8B-Base, outperforming competitive baselines.

Abstract: Detecting whether a model has been poisoned is a longstanding problem in AI security. In this work, we present a practical scanner for identifying sleeper agent-style backdoors in causal language models. Our approach relies on two key findings: first, sleeper agents tend to memorize poisoning data, making it possible to leak backdoor examples using memory extraction techniques. Second, poisoned LLMs exhibit distinctive patterns in their output distributions and attention heads when backdoor triggers are present in the input. Guided by these observations, we develop a scalable backdoor scanning methodology that assumes no prior knowledge of the trigger or target behavior and requires only inference operations. Our scanner integrates naturally into broader defensive strategies and does not alter model performance. We show that our method recovers working triggers across multiple backdoor scenarios and a broad range of models and fine-tuning methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03085v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Predictor-Corrector: Solving Homotopy Problems with Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03086</link><description>arXiv:2602.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Homotopy paradigm, a general principle for solving challenging problems, appears across diverse domains such as robust optimization, global optimization, polynomial root-finding, and sampling. Practical solvers for these problems typically follow a predictor-corrector (PC) structure, but rely on hand-crafted heuristics for step sizes and iteration termination, which are often suboptimal and task-specific. To address this, we unify these problems under a single framework, which enables the design of a general neural solver. Building on this unified view, we propose Neural Predictor-Corrector (NPC), which replaces hand-crafted heuristics with automatically learned policies. NPC formulates policy selection as a sequential decision-making problem and leverages reinforcement learning to automatically discover efficient strategies. To further enhance generalization, we introduce an amortized training mechanism, enabling one-time offline training for a class of problems and efficient online inference on new instances. Experiments on four representative homotopy problems demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively to unseen instances. It consistently outperforms classical and specialized baselines in efficiency while demonstrating superior stability across tasks, highlighting the value of unifying homotopy methods into a single neural framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03086v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training and Simulation of Quadrupedal Robot in Adaptive Stair Climbing for Indoor Firefighting: An End-to-End Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03087</link><description>arXiv:2602.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadruped robots are used for primary searches during the early stages of indoor fires. A typical primary search involves quickly and thoroughly looking for victims under hazardous conditions and monitoring flammable materials. However, situational awareness in complex indoor environments and rapid stair climbing across different staircases remain the main challenges for robot-assisted primary searches. In this project, we designed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize both navigation and locomotion. In the first stage, the quadrupeds, Unitree Go2, were trained to climb stairs in Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain. In the second stage, the quadrupeds were trained to climb various realistic indoor staircases in the Isaac Lab engine, with the learned policy transferred from the previous stage. These indoor staircases are straight, L-shaped, and spiral, to support climbing tasks in complex environments. This project explores how to balance navigation and locomotion and how end-to-end RL methods can enable quadrupeds to adapt to different stair shapes. Our main contributions are: (1) A two-stage end-to-end RL framework that transfers stair-climbing skills from abstract pyramid terrain to realistic indoor stair topologies. (2) A centerline-based navigation formulation that enables unified learning of navigation and locomotion without hierarchical planning. (3) Demonstration of policy generalization across diverse staircases using only local height-map perception. (4) An empirical analysis of success, efficiency, and failure modes under increasing stair difficulty.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03087v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative Artificial Intelligence creates delicious, sustainable, and nutritious burgers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03092</link><description>arXiv:2602.03092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food choices shape both human and planetary health; yet, designing foods that are delicious, nutritious, and sustainable remains challenging. Here we show that generative artificial intelligence can learn the structure of the human palate directly from large-scale, human-generated recipe data to create novel foods within a structured design space. Using burgers as a model system, the generative AI rediscovers the classic Big Mac without explicit supervision and generates novel burgers optimized for deliciousness, sustainability, or nutrition. Compared to the Big Mac, its delicious burgers score the same or better in overall liking, flavor, and texture in a blinded sensory evaluation conducted in a restaurant setting with 101 participants; its mushroom burger achieves an environmental impact score more than an order of magnitude lower; and its bean burger attains nearly twice the nutritional score. Together, these results establish generative AI as a quantitative framework for learning human taste and navigating complex trade-offs in principled food design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03092v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Maintaining the Heterogeneity in the Organization of Software Engineering Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03093</link><description>arXiv:2602.03093v1 Announce Type: new

To address these challenges, we propose Test-time Recursive Thinking (TRT), an iterative self-improvement framework that conditions generation on rollout-specific strategies, accumulated knowledge, and self-generated verification signals. Using TRT, open-source models reach 100% accuracy on AIME-25/24, and on LiveCodeBench's most difficult problems, closed-source models improve by 10.4-14.8 percentage points without external feedback.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03094v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gen-Diaolou: An Integrated AI-Assisted Interactive System for Diachronic Understanding and Preservation of the Kaiping Diaolou</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03095</link><description>arXiv:2602.03095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kaiping Diaolou and Villages, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, exemplify hybrid Chinese and Western architecture shaped by migration culture.

This research explores current challenges of leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for architectural heritage, and how AI-assisted interactive systems can foster cultural heritage understanding and preservation awareness. We conducted a formative study (N=14) to uncover empirical insights from heritage stakeholders that inform design. These insights informed the design of Gen-Diaolou, an integrated AI-assisted interactive system that supports heritage understanding and preservation. A pilot study (N=18) and a museum field study (N=26) provided converging evidence suggesting that Gen-Diaolou may support visitors' diachronic understanding and preservation awareness, and together informed design implications for future human-AI collaborative systems for digital cultural heritage engagement. More broadly, this work bridges the research gap between passive heritage systems and unconstrained creative tools in the HCI domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03095v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PRISM: Structured Optimization via Anisotropic Spectral Shaping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03096</link><description>arXiv:2602.03096v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Professional job recommendation involves a complex bipartite matching process that must reconcile a candidate's subjective preference with an employer's objective qualification. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are well-suited for modeling the rich semantics of resumes and job descriptions, existing paradigms often collapse these two decision dimensions into a single interaction signal, yielding confounded supervision under recruitment-funnel censoring and limiting policy controllability. To address these challenges, We propose JobRec, a generative job recommendation framework for de-conflating preference and qualification via constrained dual-perspective reasoning. JobRec introduces a Unified Semantic Alignment Schema that aligns candidate and job attributes into structured semantic layers, and a Two-Stage Cooperative Training Strategy that learns decoupled experts to separately infer preference and qualification. Building on these experts, a Lagrangian-based Policy Alignment module optimizes recommendations under explicit eligibility requirements, enabling controllable trade-offs. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a synthetic dataset refined by experts. Experiments show that JobRec consistently outperforms strong baselines and provides improved controllability for strategy-aware professional matching.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03097v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TextME: Bridging Unseen Modalities Through Text Descriptions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03098</link><description>arXiv:2602.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding multimodal representations to novel modalities is constrained by reliance on large-scale paired datasets (e.g., text-image, text-audio, text-3D, text-molecule), which are costly and often infeasible in domains requiring expert annotation such as medical imaging and molecular analysis. We introduce TextME, the first text-only modality expansion framework, to the best of our knowledge, projecting diverse modalities into LLM embedding space as a unified anchor. Our approach exploits the geometric structure of pretrained contrastive encoders to enable zero-shot cross-modal transfer using only text descriptions, without paired supervision. We empirically validate that such consistent modality gaps exist across image, video, audio, 3D, X-ray, and molecular domains, demonstrating that text-only training can preserve substantial performance of pretrained encoders. We further show that our framework enables emergent cross-modal retrieval between modality pairs not explicitly aligned during training (e.g., audio-to-image, 3D-to-image). These results establish text-only training as a practical alternative to paired supervision for modality expansion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03098v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Risky-Bench: Probing Agentic Safety Risks under Real-World Deployment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03100</link><description>arXiv:2602.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that operate in real-world environments, introducing safety risks beyond linguistic harm. Existing agent safety evaluations rely on risk-oriented tasks tailored to specific agent settings, resulting in limited coverage of safety risk space and failing to assess agent safety behavior during long-horizon, interactive task execution in complex real-world deployments. Moreover, their specialization to particular agent settings limits adaptability across diverse agent configurations. To address these limitations, we propose Risky-Bench, a framework that enables systematic agent safety evaluation grounded in real-world deployment. Risky-Bench organizes evaluation around domain-agnostic safety principles to derive context-aware safety rubrics that delineate safety space, and systematically evaluates safety risks across this space through realistic task execution under varying threat assumptions. When applied to life-assist agent settings, Risky-Bench uncovers substantial safety risks in state-of-the-art agents under realistic execution conditions. Moreover, as a well-structured evaluation pipeline, Risky-Bench is not confined to life-assist scenarios and can be adapted to other deployment settings to construct environment-specific safety evaluations, providing an extensible methodology for agent safety assessment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03100v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Consensus Group Relative Policy Optimization for Text Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03102</link><description>arXiv:2602.03102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many strong decoding methods for text generation follow a sample-and-rerank paradigm: they draw multiple candidates, score each under a utility (reward) function using consensus across samples, and return the best one. Although effective, these methods incur high computational costs during inference due to repeated sampling and scoring. Prior attempts to amortize inference-time computation typically rely on gold references, teacher labels, or curated preference data, increasing dataset construction effort and the demand for high-fidelity reward models. We propose Consensus Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), which distills Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding into training by formulating the consensus utility as a group-relative objective within GRPO. C-GRPO requires only a utility function and policy samples, without gold references or explicit preference labels. Under ideal conditions, we show that the objective function of C-GRPO is directionally aligned with the gradient of the expected-utility objective underlying MBR decoding, leading to a convergence guarantee. Experiments on machine translation (WMT 2024) and text summarization (XSum) demonstrate that C-GRPO successfully achieves performance comparable to MBR decoding without the associated inference-time overhead, while outperforming reference-free baseline methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03102v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Task--Specificity Score: Measuring How Much Instructions Really Matter for Supervision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03103</link><description>arXiv:2602.03103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is now the default way to train and adapt large language models, but many instruction--input--output pairs are only weakly specified: for a given input, the same output can remain plausible under several alternative instructions. This raises a simple question: \emph{does the instruction uniquely determine the target output?}
  We propose the \textbf{Task--Specificity Score (TSS)} to quantify how much an instruction matters for predicting its output, by contrasting the true instruction against plausible alternatives for the same input. We further introduce \textbf{TSS++}, which uses hard alternatives and a small quality term to mitigate easy-negative effects. Across three instruction datasets (\textsc{Alpaca}, \textsc{Dolly-15k}, \textsc{NI-20}) and three open LLMs (Gemma, Llama, Qwen), we show that selecting task-specific examples improves downstream performance under tight token budgets and complements quality-based filters such as perplexity and IFD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "I'm happy even though it's not real": GenAI Photo Editing as a Remembering Experience</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03104</link><description>arXiv:2602.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly integrated into photo applications on personal devices, making editing photographs easier than ever while potentially influencing the memories they represent. This study explores how and why people use GenAI to edit personal photos and how this shapes their remembering experience. We conducted a two-phase qualitative study with 12 participants: a photo editing session using a GenAI tool guided by the Remembering Experience (RX) dimensions, followed by semi-structured interviews where participants reflected on the editing process and results. Findings show that participants prioritised felt memory over factual accuracy. For different photo elements, environments were modified easily, however, editing was deemed unacceptable if it touched upon a person's identity. Editing processes brought positive and negative impacts, and itself also became a remembering experience. We further discuss potential benefits and risks of GenAI editing for remembering purposes and propose design implications for responsible GenAI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03104v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gromov Wasserstein Optimal Transport for Semantic Correspondences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03105</link><description>arXiv:2602.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing correspondences between image pairs is a long studied problem in computer vision. With recent large-scale foundation models showing strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks including classification and segmentation, there has been interest in using the internal feature maps of these models for the semantic correspondence task. Recent works observe that features from DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion (SD) are complementary, the former producing accurate but sparse correspondences, while the latter produces spatially consistent correspondences. As a result, current state-of-the-art methods for semantic correspondence involve combining features from both models in an ensemble. While the performance of these methods is impressive, they are computationally expensive, requiring evaluating feature maps from large-scale foundation models. In this work we take a different approach, instead replacing SD features with a superior matching algorithm which is imbued with the desirable spatial consistency property. Specifically, we replace the standard nearest neighbours matching with an optimal transport algorithm that includes a Gromov Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior. We show that we can significantly boost the performance of the DINOv2 baseline, and be competitive and sometimes surpassing state-of-the-art methods using Stable Diffusion features, while being 5--10x more efficient.

Abstract: From a pragmatic perspective, this study systematically evaluates the differences in performance among representative large language models (LLMs) in recognizing politeness, impoliteness, and mock politeness phenomena in Chinese. Addressing the existing gaps in pragmatic comprehension, the research adopts the frameworks of Rapport Management Theory and the Model of Mock Politeness to construct a three-category dataset combining authentic and simulated Chinese discourse.

This study serves as a meaningful attempt within the paradigm of ``Great Linguistics,'' offering a novel approach to applying pragmatic theory in the age of technological transformation. It also responds to the contemporary question of how technology and the humanities may coexist, representing an interdisciplinary endeavor that bridges linguistic technology and humanistic reflection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03107v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ChemPro: A Progressive Chemistry Benchmark for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03108</link><description>arXiv:2602.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ChemPro, a progressive benchmark with 4100 natural language question-answer pairs in Chemistry, across 4 coherent sections of difficulty designed to assess the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a broad spectrum of general chemistry topics. We include Multiple Choice Questions and Numerical Questions spread across fine-grained information recall, long-horizon reasoning, multi-concept questions, problem-solving with nuanced articulation, and straightforward questions in a balanced ratio, effectively covering Bio-Chemistry, Inorganic-Chemistry, Organic-Chemistry and Physical-Chemistry. ChemPro is carefully designed analogous to a student's academic evaluation for basic to high-school chemistry. A gradual increase in the question difficulty rigorously tests the ability of LLMs to progress from solving basic problems to solving more sophisticated challenges.
  We evaluate 45+7 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and proprietary variants, and our analysis reveals that while LLMs perform well on basic chemistry questions, their accuracy declines with different types and levels of complexity. These findings highlight the critical limitations of LLMs in general scientific reasoning and understanding and point towards understudied dimensions of difficulty, emphasizing the need for more robust methodologies to improve LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03108v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One Model, All Roles: Multi-Turn, Multi-Agent Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for Conversational Social Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03109</link><description>arXiv:2602.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces OMAR: One Model, All Roles, a reinforcement learning framework that enables AI to develop social intelligence through multi-turn, multi-agent conversational self-play. Unlike traditional paradigms that rely on static, single-turn optimizations, OMAR allows a single model to role-play all participants in a conversation simultaneously, learning to achieve long-term goals and complex social norms directly from dynamic social interaction. To ensure training stability across long dialogues, we implement a hierarchical advantage estimation that calculates turn-level and token-level advantages. Evaluations in the SOTOPIA social environment and Werewolf strategy games show that our trained models develop fine-grained, emergent social intelligence, such as empathy, persuasion, and compromise seeking, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning collaboration even under competitive scenarios. While we identify practical challenges like reward hacking, our results show that rich social intelligence can emerge without human supervision. We hope this work incentivizes further research on AI social intelligence in group conversations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03109v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Candidate Set with Scene-Adaptive Refinement via Diffusion for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03112</link><description>arXiv:2602.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving is increasingly adopting a multimodal planning paradigm that generates multiple trajectory candidates and selects the final plan, making candidate-set design critical. A fixed trajectory vocabulary provides stable coverage in routine driving but often misses optimal solutions in complex interactions, while scene-adaptive refinement can cause over-correction in simple scenarios by unnecessarily perturbing already strong vocabulary trajectories.We propose CdDrive, which preserves the original vocabulary candidates and augments them with scene-adaptive candidates generated by vocabulary-conditioned diffusion denoising. Both candidate types are jointly scored by a shared selection module, enabling reliable performance across routine and highly interactive scenarios. We further introduce HATNA (Horizon-Aware Trajectory Noise Adapter) to improve the smoothness and geometric continuity of diffusion candidates via temporal smoothing and horizon-aware noise modulation. Experiments on NAVSIM v1 and NAVSIM v2 demonstrate leading performance, and ablations verify the contribution of each component.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Digital Lifelong Learning in the Age of AI: Trends and Insights</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03114</link><description>arXiv:2602.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid innovations in AI and large language models (LLMs) have accelerated the adoption of digital learning, particularly beyond formal education. What began as an emergency response during COVID-19 has shifted from a supplementary resource to an essential pillar of education. Understanding how digital learning continues to evolve for adult and lifelong learners is therefore increasingly important.
  This study examines how various demographics interact with digital learning platforms, focusing on the learner motivations, the effectiveness of gamification in digital learning, and the integration of AI. Using multi survey data from 200 respondents and advanced analytics, our findings reveal a notable increase in the perceived relevance of digital learning after the pandemic, especially among young adults and women, coinciding with the rise of LLM-powered AI tools that support personalized learning. We aim to provide actionable insights for businesses, government policymakers, and educators seeking to optimize their digital learning offerings to meet evolving workforce needs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgentDyn: A Dynamic Open-Ended Benchmark for Evaluating Prompt Injection Attacks of Real-World Agent Security System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03117</link><description>arXiv:2602.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents that autonomously interact with external tools and environments show great promise across real-world applications. However, the external data which agent consumes also leads to the risk of indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in third-party content hijack agent behavior. Guided by benchmarks, such as AgentDojo, there has been significant amount of progress in developing defense against the said attacks. As the technology continues to mature, and that agents are increasingly being relied upon for more complex tasks, there is increasing pressing need to also evolve the benchmark to reflect threat landscape faced by emerging agentic systems. In this work, we reveal three fundamental flaws in current benchmarks and push the frontier along these dimensions: (i) lack of dynamic open-ended tasks, (ii) lack of helpful instructions, and (iii) simplistic user tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentDyn, a manually designed benchmark featuring 60 challenging open-ended tasks and 560 injection test cases across Shopping, GitHub, and Daily Life. Unlike prior static benchmarks, AgentDyn requires dynamic planning and incorporates helpful third-party instructions. Our evaluation of ten state-of-the-art defenses suggests that almost all existing defenses are either not secure enough or suffer from significant over-defense, revealing that existing defenses are still far from real-world deployment. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/leolee99/AgentDyn.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03117v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The High Cost of Data Augmentation for Learning Equivariant Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03118</link><description>arXiv:2602.03118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Noether's theorem the presence of a continuous symmetry in a Hamiltonian systems is equivalent to the existence of a conserved quantity, yet these symmetries are not always explicitly enforced in data-driven models. There remains a debate whether or not encoding of symmetry into a model architecture is the optimal approach. A competing approach is to target approximate symmetry through data augmentation. In this work, we study two approaches aimed at improving the symmetry properties of such an approximation scheme: one based on a quadrature rule for the Haar measure on the compact Lie group encoding the continuous symmetry of interest and one based on a random sampling of that Haar measure. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that the quadrature augmentation leads to exact symmetry preservation in polynomial models, while the random augmentation has only square-root convergence of the symmetrization error.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03118v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Function-Space Empirical Bayes Regularisation with Large Vision-Language Model Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03119</link><description>arXiv:2602.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian deep learning (BDL) provides a principled framework for reliable uncertainty quantification by combining deep neural networks with Bayesian inference. A central challenge in BDL lies in the design of informative prior distributions that scale effectively to high-dimensional data. Recent functional variational inference (VI) approaches address this issue by imposing priors directly in function space; however, most existing methods rely on Gaussian process (GP) priors, whose expressiveness and generalisation capabilities become limited in high-dimensional regimes. In this work, we propose VLM-FS-EB, a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework, leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs) to generates semantically meaningful context points. These synthetic samples are then used VLMs for embeddings to construct expressive functional priors. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various baselines, and experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves predictive performance and yields more reliable uncertainty estimates, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks and data-scarce regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03119v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantized Evolution Strategies: High-precision Fine-tuning of Quantized LLMs at Low-precision Cost</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03120</link><description>arXiv:2602.03120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on memory-constrained devices, yet it renders models static and difficult to fine-tune. Standard fine-tuning paradigms, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), fundamentally rely on backpropagation and high-precision weights to compute gradients. Thus they cannot be used on quantized models, where the parameter space is discrete and non-differentiable. While Evolution Strategies (ES) offer a backpropagation-free alternative, optimization of the quantized parameters can still fail due to vanishing or inaccurate gradient. This paper introduces Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES), an optimization paradigm that performs full-parameter fine-tuning directly in the quantized space. QES is based on two innovations: (1) it integrates accumulated error feedback to preserve high-precision gradient signals, and (2) it utilizes a stateless seed replay to reduce memory usage to low-precision inference levels. QES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zeroth-order fine-tuning method on arithmetic reasoning tasks, making direct fine-tuning for quantized models possible. It therefore opens up the possibility for scaling up LLMs entirely in the quantized space.

Abstract: Data augmentation has long been a cornerstone for reducing overfitting in vision models, with methods like AutoAugment automating the design of task-specific augmentations. Recent advances in generative models, such as conditional diffusion and few-shot NeRFs, offer a new paradigm for data augmentation by synthesizing data with significantly greater diversity and realism. However, unlike traditional augmentations like cropping or rotation, these methods introduce substantial changes that enhance robustness but also risk degrading performance if the augmentations are poorly matched to the task. In this work, we present EvoAug, an automated augmentation learning pipeline, which leverages these generative models alongside an efficient evolutionary algorithm to learn optimal task-specific augmentations. Our pipeline introduces a novel approach to image augmentation that learns stochastic augmentation trees that hierarchically compose augmentations, enabling more structured and adaptive transformations. We demonstrate strong performance across fine-grained classification and few-shot learning tasks. Notably, our pipeline discovers augmentations that align with domain knowledge, even in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential of learned generative augmentations, unlocking new possibilities for robust model training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03123v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feature, Alignment, and Supervision in Category Learning: A Comparative Approach with Children and Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03124</link><description>arXiv:2602.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how humans and machines learn from sparse data is central to cognitive science and machine learning. Using a species-fair design, we compare children and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a few-shot semi-supervised category learning task. Both learners are exposed to novel object categories under identical conditions. Learners receive mixtures of labeled and unlabeled exemplars while we vary supervision (1/3/6 labels), target feature (size, shape, pattern), and perceptual alignment (high/low). We find that children generalize rapidly from minimal labels but show strong feature-specific biases and sensitivity to alignment. CNNs show a different interaction profile: added supervision improves performance, but both alignment and feature structure moderate the impact additional supervision has on learning. These results show that human-model comparisons must be drawn under the right conditions, emphasizing interactions among supervision, feature structure, and alignment rather than overall accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Flexible Geometric Guidance for Probabilistic Human Pose Estimation with Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03126</link><description>arXiv:2602.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from 2D images is a challenging problem due to depth ambiguity and occlusion. Because of these challenges the task is underdetermined, where there exists multiple -- possibly infinite -- poses that are plausible given the image. Despite this, many prior works assume the existence of a deterministic mapping and estimate a single pose given an image. Furthermore, methods based on machine learning require a large amount of paired 2D-3D data to train and suffer from generalization issues to unseen scenarios. To address both of these issues, we propose a framework for pose estimation using diffusion models, which enables sampling from a probability distribution over plausible poses which are consistent with a 2D image. Our approach falls under the guidance framework for conditional generation, and guides samples from an unconditional diffusion model, trained only on 3D data, using the gradients of the heatmaps from a 2D keypoint detector. We evaluate our method on the Human 3.6M dataset under best-of-$m$ multiple hypothesis evaluation, showing state-of-the-art performance among methods which do not require paired 2D-3D data for training. We additionally evaluate the generalization ability using the MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW datasets and demonstrate competitive performance. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by using it for novel tasks including pose generation and pose completion, without the need to train bespoke conditional models.

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM frameworks are widely used to accelerate the development of agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs). These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%. Finally, we translate our findings into concrete architectural design principles and framework selection guidance, and outline promising future research directions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03128v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FinMTM: A Multi-Turn Multimodal Benchmark for Financial Reasoning and Agent Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03130</link><description>arXiv:2602.03130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The financial domain poses substantial challenges for vision-language models (VLMs) due to specialized chart formats and knowledge-intensive reasoning requirements. However, existing financial benchmarks are largely single-turn and rely on a narrow set of question formats, limiting comprehensive evaluation in realistic application scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FinMTM, a multi-turn multimodal benchmark that expands diversity along both data and task dimensions. On the data side, we curate and annotate 11{,}133 bilingual (Chinese and English) financial QA pairs grounded in financial visuals, including candlestick charts, statistical plots, and report figures. On the task side, FinMTM covers single- and multiple-choice questions, multi-turn open-ended dialogues, and agent-based tasks. We further design task-specific evaluation protocols, including a set-overlap scoring rule for multiple-choice questions, a weighted combination of turn-level and session-level scores for multi-turn dialogues, and a composite metric that integrates planning quality with final outcomes for agent tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation of 22 VLMs reveal their limitations in fine-grained visual perception, long-context reasoning, and complex agent workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03130v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Contrastive Concept-Tree Search for LLM-Assisted Algorithm Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03132</link><description>arXiv:2602.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language Model (LLM)-assisted algorithm discovery is an iterative, black-box optimization process over programs to approximatively solve a target task, where an LLM proposes candidate programs and an external evaluator provides task feedback. Despite intense recent research on the topic and promising results, how can the LLM internal representation of the space of possible programs be maximally exploited to improve performance is an open question. Here, we introduce Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), which extracts a hierarchical concept representation from the generated programs and learns a contrastive concept model that guides parent selection. By reweighting parents using a likelihood-ratio score between high- and low-performing solutions, CCTS biases search toward useful concept combinations and away from misleading ones, providing guidance through an explicit concept hierarchy rather than the algorithm lineage constructed by the LLM. We show that CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines and produces interpretable, task-specific concept trees across a benchmark of open Erd\H{o}s-type combinatorics problems. Our analysis indicates that the gains are driven largely by learning which concepts to avoid. We further validate these findings in a controlled synthetic algorithm-discovery environment, which reproduces qualitatively the search dynamics observed with the LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SwiftVLM: Efficient Vision-Language Model Inference via Cross-Layer Token Bypass</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03134</link><description>arXiv:2602.03134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual token pruning is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of vision-language models (VLMs), and existing methods often rely on early pruning decisions to improve efficiency. While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers. Experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03134v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhanced Parcel Arrival Forecasting for Logistic Hubs: An Ensemble Deep Learning Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03135</link><description>arXiv:2602.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of online shopping has increased the demand for timely parcel delivery, compelling logistics service providers to enhance the efficiency, agility, and predictability of their hub networks. In order to solve the problem, we propose a novel deep learning-based ensemble framework that leverages historical arrival patterns and real-time parcel status updates to forecast upcoming workloads at logistic hubs. This approach not only facilitates the generation of short-term forecasts, but also improves the accuracy of future hub workload predictions for more strategic planning and resource management. Empirical tests of the algorithm, conducted through a case study of a major city's parcel logistics, demonstrate the ensemble method's superiority over both traditional forecasting techniques and standalone deep learning models. Our findings highlight the significant potential of this method to improve operational efficiency in logistics hubs and advocate for its broader adoption.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03135v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FSOD-VFM: Few-Shot Object Detection with Vision Foundation Models and Graph Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03137</link><description>arXiv:2602.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present FSOD-VFM: Few-Shot Object Detectors with Vision Foundation Models, a framework that leverages vision foundation models to tackle the challenge of few-shot object detection. FSOD-VFM integrates three key components: a universal proposal network (UPN) for category-agnostic bounding box generation, SAM2 for accurate mask extraction, and DINOv2 features for efficient adaptation to new object categories. Despite the strong generalization capabilities of foundation models, the bounding boxes generated by UPN often suffer from overfragmentation, covering only partial object regions and leading to numerous small, false-positive proposals rather than accurate, complete object detections. To address this issue, we introduce a novel graph-based confidence reweighting method. In our approach, predicted bounding boxes are modeled as nodes in a directed graph, with graph diffusion operations applied to propagate confidence scores across the network. This reweighting process refines the scores of proposals, assigning higher confidence to whole objects and lower confidence to local, fragmented parts. This strategy improves detection granularity and effectively reduces the occurrence of false-positive bounding box proposals. Through extensive experiments on Pascal-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$, and CD-FSOD datasets, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance without requiring additional training. Notably, on the challenging CD-FSOD dataset, which spans multiple datasets and domains, our FSOD-VFM achieves 31.6 AP in the 10-shot setting, substantially outperforming previous training-free methods that reach only 21.4 AP.

Abstract: Traffic-density matrices from different days exhibit both low rank and stable correlations in their singular-vector subspaces. Leveraging this, we introduce SATORIS-N, a framework for imputing partially observed traffic-density by informed subspace priors from neighboring days. Our contribution is a subspace-aware semidefinite programming (SDP)} formulation of nuclear norm that explicitly informs the reconstruction with prior singular-subspace information. This convex formulation jointly enforces low rank and subspace alignment, providing a single global optimum and substantially improving accuracy under medium and high occlusion. We also study a lightweight implicit subspace-alignment} strategy in which matrices from consecutive days are concatenated to encourage alignment of spatial or temporal singular directions. Although this heuristic offers modest gains when missing rates are low, the explicit SDP approach is markedly more robust when large fractions of entries are missing. Across two real-world datasets (Beijing and Shanghai), SATORIS-N consistently outperforms standard matrix-completion methods such as SoftImpute, IterativeSVD, statistical, and even deep learning baselines at high occlusion levels. The framework generalizes to other spatiotemporal settings in which singular subspaces evolve slowly over time. In the context of intelligent vehicles and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems, accurate traffic-density
  reconstruction enables critical applications including cooperative perception, predictive routing, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication optimization. When infrastructure sensors or vehicle-reported observations are incomplete - due to communication dropouts, sensor occlusions, or sparse connected vehicle penetration-reliable imputation becomes essential for safe and efficient autonomous navigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03138v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diversity-Preserved Distribution Matching Distillation for Fast Visual Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03139</link><description>arXiv:2602.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution matching distillation (DMD) aligns a multi-step generator with its few-step counterpart to enable high-quality generation under low inference cost. However, DMD tends to suffer from mode collapse, as its reverse-KL formulation inherently encourages mode-seeking behavior, for which existing remedies typically rely on perceptual or adversarial regularization, thereby incurring substantial computational overhead and training instability. In this work, we propose a role-separated distillation framework that explicitly disentangles the roles of distilled steps: the first step is dedicated to preserving sample diversity via a target-prediction (e.g., v-prediction) objective, while subsequent steps focus on quality refinement under the standard DMD loss, with gradients from the DMD objective blocked at the first step. We term this approach Diversity-Preserved DMD (DP-DMD), which, despite its simplicity -- no perceptual backbone, no discriminator, no auxiliary networks, and no additional ground-truth images -- preserves sample diversity while maintaining visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods in extensive text-to-image experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03139v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analyzing Zigbee Traffic: Datasets, Classification and Storage Trade-offs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03140</link><description>arXiv:2602.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zigbee is widely used in smart home environments due to its low power consumption and support for mesh networking, making it a relevant target for traffic-based IoT forensic analysis. However, existing studies often rely on limited datasets and fixed network configurations. In this paper, we analyze Zigbee network traffic from three complementary perspectives: data collection, traffic classification, and storage efficiency. We introduce ZIOTP2025, a publicly available dataset of Zigbee traffic collected from commercial smart home devices deployed under multiple network configurations and capturing realistic interaction scenarios. Using this dataset, we study two traffic classification tasks: device type classification and individual device identification, and evaluate their robustness under both intra-configuration and cross-configuration settings. Our results show that while high classification accuracy can be achieved under controlled conditions, performance degrades significantly when models are evaluated across different network configurations, particularly for fine-grained identification tasks. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between traffic storage requirements and classification accuracy. We show that lossy compression of traffic features through quantization can reduce storage requirements by approximately 4-5x compared to lossless storage of raw packet traces, while preserving near-lossless classification performance. Overall, our results highlight the need for topology-aware Zigbee traffic analysis and storage-efficient feature compression to enable robust and scalable IoT forensic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03140v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Short Chains, Deep Thoughts: Balancing Reasoning Efficiency and Intra-Segment Capability via Split-Merge Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03141</link><description>arXiv:2602.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks through the generation of long reasoning chains, this reliance on verbose generation results in significant latency and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{CoSMo} (\textbf{Co}nsistency-Guided \textbf{S}plit-\textbf{M}erge \textbf{O}ptimization), a framework designed to eliminate structural redundancy rather than indiscriminately restricting token volume. Specifically, CoSMo utilizes a split-merge algorithm that dynamically refines reasoning chains by merging redundant segments and splitting logical gaps to ensure coherence. We then employ structure-aligned reinforcement learning with a novel segment-level budget to supervise the model in maintaining efficient reasoning structures throughout training. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoSMo achieves superior performance, improving accuracy by \textbf{3.3} points while reducing segment usage by \textbf{28.7\%} on average compared to reasoning efficiency baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03141v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Hinting Language Models Enhance Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03143</link><description>arXiv:2602.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has recently emerged as a practical recipe for aligning large language models with verifiable objectives. However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt $x$, the model samples a compact hint $h$ (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution $\tau$ conditioned on $(x,h)$. Crucially, the task reward $R(x,\tau)$ is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set $h=\varnothing$ and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

Abstract: Teaching requires distilling a rich category distribution into a small set of informative exemplars. Although prior work shows that humans consider both representativeness and diversity when teaching, the computational principles underlying these tradeoffs remain unclear. We address this gap by modeling human exemplar selection using neural network feature representations and principled subset selection criteria. Novel visual categories were embedded along a one-dimensional morph continuum using pretrained vision models, and selection strategies varied in their emphasis on prototypicality, joint representativeness, and diversity. Adult participants selected one to three exemplars to teach a learner. Model-human comparisons revealed that strategies based on joint representativeness, or its combination with diversity, best captured human judgments, whereas purely prototypical or diversity-based strategies performed worse. Moreover, transformer-based representations consistently aligned more closely with human behavior than convolutional networks. These results highlight the potential utility of dataset distillation methods in machine learning as computational models for teaching.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03144v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Internet of Agentic AI: Incentive-Compatible Distributed Teaming and Workflow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03145</link><description>arXiv:2602.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of agentic AI systems that reason, plan, and act by invoking external tools. However, most existing agentic architectures remain centralized and monolithic, limiting scalability, specialization, and interoperability. This paper proposes a framework for scalable agentic intelligence, termed the Internet of Agentic AI, in which autonomous, heterogeneous agents distributed across cloud and edge infrastructure dynamically form coalitions to execute task-driven workflows. We formalize a network-native model of agentic collaboration and introduce an incentive-compatible workflow-coalition feasibility framework that integrates capability coverage, network locality, and economic implementability. To enable scalable coordination, we formulate a minimum-effort coalition selection problem and propose a decentralized coalition formation algorithm. The proposed framework can operate as a coordination layer above the Model Context Protocol (MCP). A healthcare case study demonstrates how domain specialization, cloud-edge heterogeneity, and dynamic coalition formation enable scalable, resilient, and economically viable agentic workflows. This work lays the foundation for principled coordination and scalability in the emerging era of Internet of Agentic AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03145v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] General Agents Contain World Models, even under Partial Observability and Stochasticity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03146</link><description>arXiv:2602.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciding whether an agent possesses a model of its surrounding world is a fundamental step toward understanding its capabilities and limitations. In [10], it was shown that, within a particular framework, every almost optimal and general agent necessarily contains sufficient knowledge of its environment to allow an approximate reconstruction of it by querying the agent as a black box. This result relied on the assumptions that the agent is deterministic and that the environment is fully observable.
  In this work, we remove both assumptions by extending the theorem to stochastic agents operating in partially observable environments. Fundamentally, this shows that stochastic agents cannot avoid learning their environment through the usage of randomization. We also strengthen the result by weakening the notion of generality, proving that less powerful agents already contain a model of the world in which they operate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Foundation VLM Robustness to Missing Modality: Scalable Diffusion for Bi-directional Feature Restoration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03151</link><description>arXiv:2602.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically assume complete modality input during inference. However, their effectiveness drops sharply when certain modalities are unavailable or incomplete. Current research primarily faces two dilemmas: Prompt-based methods struggle to restore missing yet indispensable features and impair generalization of VLMs. Imputation-based approaches, lacking effective guidance, are prone to generating semantically irrelevant noise. Restoring precise semantics while sustaining VLM generalization remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a general missing modality restoration strategy in this paper. We introduce an enhanced diffusion model as a pluggable mid-stage training module to effectively restore missing features. Our strategy introduces two key innovations: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating, which adaptively leverages conditional features to steer the generation of semantically consistent features; (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning mechanism, which bridges the semantic spaces of dual encoders to achieve bidirectional alignment. Zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm our model as a robust and scalable extension for VLMs in missing modality scenarios, ensuring reliability across diverse missing rates and environments. Our code and models will be publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FASA: Frequency-aware Sparse Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03152</link><description>arXiv:2602.03152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical bottleneck when handling lengthy inputs: the prohibitive memory footprint of the Key Value (KV) cache. To address this bottleneck, the token pruning paradigm leverages attention sparsity to selectively retain a small, critical subset of tokens. However, existing approaches fall short, with static methods risking irreversible information loss and dynamic strategies employing heuristics that insufficiently capture the query-dependent nature of token importance. We propose FASA, a novel framework that achieves query-aware token eviction by dynamically predicting token importance. FASA stems from a novel insight into RoPE: the discovery of functional sparsity at the frequency-chunk (FC) level. Our key finding is that a small, identifiable subset of "dominant" FCs consistently exhibits high contextual agreement with the full attention head. This provides a robust and computationally free proxy for identifying salient tokens. %making them a powerful and efficient proxy for token importance. Building on this insight, FASA first identifies a critical set of tokens using dominant FCs, and then performs focused attention computation solely on this pruned subset. % Since accessing only a small fraction of the KV cache, FASA drastically lowers memory bandwidth requirements and computational cost. Across a spectrum of long-context tasks, from sequence modeling to complex CoT reasoning, FASA consistently outperforms all token-eviction baselines and achieves near-oracle accuracy, demonstrating remarkable robustness even under constraint budgets. Notably, on LongBench-V1, FASA reaches nearly 100\% of full-KV performance when only keeping 256 tokens, and achieves 2.56$\times$ speedup using just 18.9\% of the cache on AIME24.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03152v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Attention Betrays: Erasing Backdoor Attacks in Robotic Policies by Reconstructing Visual Tokens</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03153</link><description>arXiv:2602.03153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downstream fine-tuning of vision-language-action (VLA) models enhances robotics, yet exposes the pipeline to backdoor risks. Attackers can pretrain VLAs on poisoned data to implant backdoors that remain stealthy but can trigger harmful behavior during inference. However, existing defenses either lack mechanistic insight into multimodal backdoors or impose prohibitive computational costs via full-model retraining. To this end, we uncover a deep-layer attention grabbing mechanism: backdoors redirect late-stage attention and form compact embedding clusters near the clean manifold. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Bera, a test-time backdoor erasure framework that detects tokens with anomalous attention via latent-space localization, masks suspicious regions using deep-layer cues, and reconstructs a trigger-free image to break the trigger-unsafe-action mapping while restoring correct behavior. Unlike prior defenses, Bera requires neither retraining of VLAs nor any changes to the training pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple embodied platforms and tasks show that Bera effectively maintains nominal performance, significantly reduces attack success rates, and consistently restores benign behavior from backdoored outputs, thereby offering a robust and practical defense mechanism for securing robotic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03153v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Is It Possible to Make Chatbots Virtuous?

Responding to RAI's criticisms and the need to bring the wisdom traditions into HCI, we apply Conwill et al.'s Virtue-Guided Technology Design method to LLMs. We cataloged new ethical design patterns for LLMs and evaluated them through interviews with technologists. Participants valued that the patterns provided more accuracy and robustness, better safety, new research opportunities, increased access and control, and reduced waste. Their concerns were that the patterns could be vulnerable to jailbreaking, were generalizing models too widely, and had potential implementation issues.

Abstract: Deeply stacked KANs are practically impossible due to high training difficulties and substantial memory requirements. Consequently, existing studies can only incorporate few KAN layers, hindering the comprehensive exploration of KANs. This study overcomes these limitations and introduces the first fully KA-based deep model, demonstrating that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning and achieve superior learning capacity. Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy. Compared to directly deeply stacked KAN, ALL U-KAN achieves 10 times reduction in parameter count and reduces memory consumption by more than 20 times, unlocking the new explorations into deep KAN architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human-in-the-loop Adaptation in Group Activity Feature Learning for Team Sports Video Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03157</link><description>arXiv:2602.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes human-in-the-loop adaptation for Group Activity Feature Learning (GAFL) without group activity annotations. This human-in-the-loop adaptation is employed in a group-activity video retrieval framework to improve its retrieval performance. Our method initially pre-trains the GAF space based on the similarity of group activities in a self-supervised manner, unlike prior work that classifies videos into pre-defined group activity classes in a supervised learning manner. Our interactive fine-tuning process updates the GAF space to allow a user to better retrieve videos similar to query videos given by the user. In this fine-tuning, our proposed data-efficient video selection process provides several videos, which are selected from a video database, to the user in order to manually label these videos as positive or negative. These labeled videos are used to update (i.e., fine-tune) the GAF space, so that the positive and negative videos move closer to and farther away from the query videos through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive experimental results on two team sports datasets validate that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance. Ablation studies also demonstrate that several components in our human-in-the-loop adaptation contribute to the improvement of the retrieval performance.

Abstract: Misinformation on social media poses a critical threat to information credibility, as its diverse and context-dependent nature complicates detection. Large language model-empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) present a promising paradigm that enables cooperative reasoning and collective intelligence to combat this threat. However, conventional MAS suffer from an information-drowning problem, where abundant truthful content overwhelms sparse and weak deceptive cues. With full input access, agents tend to focus on dominant patterns, and inter-agent communication further amplifies this bias. To tackle this issue, we propose PAMAS, a multi-agent framework with perspective aggregation, which employs hierarchical, perspective-aware aggregation to highlight anomaly cues and alleviate information drowning. PAMAS organizes agents into three roles: Auditors, Coordinators, and a Decision-Maker. Auditors capture anomaly cues from specialized feature subsets; Coordinators aggregate their perspectives to enhance coverage while maintaining diversity; and the Decision-Maker, equipped with evolving memory and full contextual access, synthesizes all subordinate insights to produce the final judgment. Furthermore, to improve efficiency in multi-agent collaboration, PAMAS incorporates self-adaptive mechanisms for dynamic topology optimization and routing-based inference, enhancing both efficiency and scalability. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PAMAS achieves superior accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable and trustworthy way for misinformation detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03158v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VALUEFLOW: Toward Pluralistic and Steerable Value-based Alignment in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03160</link><description>arXiv:2602.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with the diverse spectrum of human values remains a central challenge: preference-based methods often fail to capture deeper motivational principles. Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control. This paper establishes a scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity, advancing pluralistic alignment of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03160v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MemCast: Memory-Driven Time Series Forecasting with Experience-Conditioned Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03164</link><description>arXiv:2602.03164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a critical role in decision-making for many real-world applications. Recently, LLM-based forecasters have made promising advancements. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods often lack explicit experience accumulation and continual evolution. In this work, we propose MemCast, a learning-to-memory framework that reformulates TSF as an experience-conditioned reasoning task. Specifically, we learn experience from the training set and organize it into a hierarchical memory. This is achieved by summarizing prediction results into historical patterns, distilling inference trajectories into reasoning wisdom, and inducing extracted temporal features into general laws. Furthermore, during inference, we leverage historical patterns to guide the reasoning process and utilize reasoning wisdom to select better trajectories, while general laws serve as criteria for reflective iteration. Additionally, to enable continual evolution, we design a dynamic confidence adaptation strategy that updates the confidence of individual entries without leaking the test set distribution. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that MemCast consistently outperforms previous methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Extreme rainfall over the Indian monsoon region poses severe societal and infrastructural risks but remains difficult to predict at daily time scales due to stochastic convective triggering and multiscale atmospheric interactions. While large-scale atmospheric fields provide important environmental context, their ability to localize extreme rainfall events is fundamentally limited. In this study, we examine how large-scale atmospheric information from ERA5 reanalysis can be leveraged for event-level probabilistic prediction of daily rainfall extremes over India. We compare an adaptive ConvLSTM baseline with a proposed Physics-Gated Latent Ordinary Differential Equation (PG-LODE) framework, which models atmospheric evolution as a continuous-time latent process whose dynamics are explicitly modulated by a physics-based gating mechanism under convectively unstable conditions. Extreme events are defined using the local 95th percentile of the India Meteorological Department gridded rainfall dataset during the June to September monsoon season. Pixel-wise evaluation shows limited skill for both models due to spatial displacement errors, whereas event-level tile-based verification reveals a clear performance contrast. The ConvLSTM remains highly conservative, detecting only 27 percent of extreme events, while PG-LODE achieves near-complete detection with a substantially higher critical success index and a moderate false alarm rate. These results demonstrate that physics-gated continuous-time latent dynamics offer a robust pathway for translating large-scale atmospheric predictability into reliable assessments of extreme rainfall risk.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03166v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial construction as a potential solution to the experiment design problem in large task spaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03172</link><description>arXiv:2602.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of work, we still lack a robust, task-general theory of human behavior even in the simplest domains. In this paper we tackle the generality problem head-on, by aiming to develop a unified model for all tasks embedded in a task-space. In particular we consider the space of binary sequence prediction tasks where the observations are generated by the space parameterized by hidden Markov models (HMM). As the space of tasks is large, experimental exploration of the entire space is infeasible. To solve this problem we propose the adversarial construction approach, which helps identify tasks that are most likely to elicit a qualitatively novel behavior. Our results suggest that adversarial construction significantly outperforms random sampling of environments and therefore could be used as a proxy for optimal experimental design in high-dimensional task spaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03172v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probe-then-Commit Multi-Objective Bandits: Theoretical Benefits of Limited Multi-Arm Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03175</link><description>arXiv:2602.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an online resource-selection problem motivated by multi-radio access selection and mobile edge computing offloading. In each round, an agent chooses among $K$ candidate links/servers (arms) whose performance is a stochastic $d$-dimensional vector (e.g., throughput, latency, energy, reliability). The key interaction is \emph{probe-then-commit (PtC)}: the agent may probe up to $q&gt;1$ candidates via control-plane measurements to observe their vector outcomes, but must execute exactly one candidate in the data plane. This limited multi-arm feedback regime strictly interpolates between classical bandits ($q=1$) and full-information experts ($q=K$), yet existing multi-objective learning theory largely focuses on these extremes. We develop \textsc{PtC-P-UCB}, an optimistic probe-then-commit algorithm whose technical core is frontier-aware probing under uncertainty in a Pareto mode, e.g., it selects the $q$ probes by approximately maximizing a hypervolume-inspired frontier-coverage potential and commits by marginal hypervolume gain to directly expand the attained Pareto region. We prove a dominated-hypervolume frontier error of $\tilde{O} (K_P d/\sqrt{qT})$, where $K_P$ is the Pareto-frontier size and $T$ is the horizon, and scalarized regret $\tilde{O} (L_\phi d\sqrt{(K/q)T})$, where $\phi$ is the scalarizer. These quantify a transparent $1/\sqrt{q}$ acceleration from limited probing. We further extend to \emph{multi-modal probing}: each probe returns $M$ modalities (e.g., CSI, queue, compute telemetry), and uncertainty fusion yields variance-adaptive versions of the above bounds via an effective noise scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03175v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BinaryDemoire: Moir\'e-Aware Binarization for Image Demoir\'eing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03176</link><description>arXiv:2602.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image demoir\'eing aims to remove structured moir\'e artifacts in recaptured imagery, where degradations are highly frequency-dependent and vary across scales and directions. While recent deep networks achieve high-quality restoration, their full-precision designs remain costly for deployment. Binarization offers an extreme compression regime by quantizing both activations and weights to 1-bit. Yet, it has been rarely studied for demoir\'eing and performs poorly when naively applied. In this work, we propose BinaryDemoire, a binarized demoir\'eing framework that explicitly accommodates the frequency structure of moir\'e degradations. First, we introduce a moir\'e-aware binary gate (MABG) that extracts lightweight frequency descriptors together with activation statistics. It predicts channel-wise gating coefficients to condition the aggregation of binary convolution responses. Second, we design a shuffle-grouped residual adapter (SGRA) that performs structured sparse shortcut alignment. It further integrates interleaved mixing to promote information exchange across different channel partitions. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed BinaryDemoire surpasses current binarization methods.

Abstract: Ground reaction forces (GRFs) provide fundamental insight into human gait mechanics and are widely used to assess joint loading, limb symmetry, balance control, and motor function. Despite their clinical relevance, the use of GRF remains underutilised in clinical workflows due to the practical limitations of force plate systems. In this work, we present a force-plate-free approach for estimating GRFs using only marker-based motion capture data. This kinematics only method to estimate and decompose GRF makes it well suited for widespread clinical depolyment. By using kinematics from sixteen body segments, we estimate the centre of mass (CoM) and compute GRFs, which are subsequently decomposed into individual components through a minimization-based approach. Through this framework, we can identify gait stance phases and provide access to clinically meaningful kinetic measures without a dedicated force plate system. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of CoM and GRF estimation based solely on kinematic data, supporting force-plate-free gait analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03177v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synthesizing File-Level Data for Unit Test Generation with Chain-of-Thoughts via Self-Debugging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03181</link><description>arXiv:2602.03181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic unit test (UT) generation is essential for software quality assurance, but existing approaches--including symbolic execution, search-based approaches, and recent LLM-based generators--struggle to produce human-quality tests with correct, meaningful assertions and reliable chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. We identify a gap in UT training data: repository-mined tests lack developer CoTs, while LLM-distilled CoTs are often incorrect or incomplete. To address this issue, we propose a novel data-distillation approach that uses self-debugging to produce high-quality UT training examples paired with faithful CoTs. Our approach combines (1) guided test repair, a heuristic loop (error-, failure-, and coverage-focused steps) that asks the used model to diagnose and iteratively fix generated tests, and (2) CoT compression, which compacts original and debugging CoTs into concise explanations that directly justify correct tests. We apply this pipeline to a large corpus of open-source projects to construct a dataset of 74,518 high-quality  examples, and then use it for supervised fine-tuning of a base model. An empirical evaluation shows that the fine-tuned model achieves high UT generation effectiveness: it attains a pass rate of 36.17% on test assertions, a branch coverage of 43.90%, and a mutation score of 88.66%, substantially higher than state-of-the-art commercial models like o4-mini.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LSGQuant: Layer-Sensitivity Guided Quantization for One-Step Diffusion Real-World Video Super-Resolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03182</link><description>arXiv:2602.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-Step Diffusion Models have demonstrated promising capability and fast inference in video super-resolution (VSR) for real-world. Nevertheless, the substantial model size and high computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) limit downstream applications. While low-bit quantization is a common approach for model compression, the effectiveness of quantized models is challenged by the high dynamic range of input latent and diverse layer behaviors. To deal with these challenges, we introduce LSGQuant, a layer-sensitivity guided quantizing approach for one-step diffusion-based real-world VSR. Our method incorporates a Dynamic Range Adaptive Quantizer (DRAQ) to fit video token activations. Furthermore, we estimate layer sensitivity and implement a Variance-Oriented Layer Training Strategy (VOLTS) by analyzing layer-wise statistics in calibration. We also introduce Quantization-Aware Optimization (QAO) to jointly refine the quantized branch and a retained high-precision branch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has nearly performance to origin model with full-precision and significantly exceeds existing quantization techniques.

Abstract: Research involving privacy-sensitive data has always been constrained by data scarcity, standing in sharp contrast to other areas that have benefited from data scaling. This challenge is becoming increasingly urgent as modern AI agents--such as OpenClaw and Gemini Agent--are granted persistent access to highly sensitive personal information. To tackle this longstanding bottleneck and the rising risks, we present Privasis (i.e., privacy oasis), the first million-scale fully synthetic dataset entirely built from scratch--an expansive reservoir of texts with rich and diverse private information--designed to broaden and accelerate research in areas where processing sensitive social data is inevitable. Compared to existing datasets, Privasis, comprising 1.4 million records, offers orders-of-magnitude larger scale with quality, and far greater diversity across various document types, including medical history, legal documents, financial records, calendars, and text messages with a total of 55.1 million annotated attributes such as ethnicity, date of birth, workplace, etc. We leverage Privasis to construct a parallel corpus for text sanitization with our pipeline that decomposes texts and applies targeted sanitization. Our compact sanitization models (&lt;=4B) trained on this dataset outperform state-of-the-art large language models, such as GPT-5 and Qwen-3 235B.

Abstract: Although Key-Value (KV) Cache is essential for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference, its growing memory footprint in long-context scenarios poses a significant bottleneck, making KVCache compression crucial. Current compression methods rely on rigid splitting strategies, such as fixed intervals or pre-defined delimiters. We observe that rigid splitting suffers from significant accuracy degradation (ranging from 5.5% to 55.1%) across different scenarios, owing to the scenario-dependent nature of the semantic boundaries. This highlights the necessity of dynamic semantic splitting to match semantics. To achieve this, we face two challenges. (1) Improper delimiter selection misaligns semantics with the KVCache, resulting in 28.6% accuracy loss. (2) Variable-length blocks after splitting introduce over 73.1% additional inference overhead. To address the above challenges, we propose DynSplit-KV, a KVCache compression method that dynamically identifies delimiters for splitting. We propose: (1) a dynamic importance-aware delimiter selection strategy, improving accuracy by 49.9%. (2) A uniform mapping strategy that transforms variable-length semantic blocks into a fixed-length format, reducing inference overhead by 4.9x. Experiments show that DynSplit-KV achieves the highest accuracy, 2.2x speedup compared with FlashAttention and 2.6x peak memory reduction in long-context scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03184v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Proportion Models for Motion Generation via Integration of Motion Primitives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03188</link><description>arXiv:2602.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables robots to acquire human-like motion skills from demonstrations, but it still requires extensive high-quality data and retraining to handle complex or long-horizon tasks. To improve data efficiency and adaptability, this study proposes a hierarchical IL framework that integrates motion primitives with proportion-based motion synthesis. The proposed method employs a two-layer architecture, where the upper layer performs long-term planning, while a set of lower-layer models learn individual motion primitives, which are combined according to specific proportions. Three model variants are introduced to explore different trade-offs between learning flexibility, computational cost, and adaptability: a learning-based proportion model, a sampling-based proportion model, and a playback-based proportion model, which differ in how the proportions are determined and whether the upper layer is trainable. Through real-robot pick-and-place experiments, the proposed models successfully generated complex motions not included in the primitive set. The sampling-based and playback-based proportion models achieved more stable and adaptable motion generation than the standard hierarchical model, demonstrating the effectiveness of proportion-based motion integration for practical robot learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03188v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prompt Augmentation Scales up GRPO Training on Mathematical Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03190</link><description>arXiv:2602.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated strong potential for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, prior work has consistently observed an entropy collapse phenomenon during reinforcement post-training, characterized by a monotonic decrease in policy entropy that ultimately leads to training instability and collapse. As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity. We show that, without a KL regularization term, prompt augmentation enables stable scaling of training duration under a fixed dataset and allows the model to tolerate low-entropy regimes without premature collapse. Empirically, a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on the MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 44.5 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.3 per-question accuracy on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key paradigm for aligning and optimizing large language models (LLMs). Standard approaches treat the LLM as the policy and apply RL directly over the full vocabulary space. However, this formulation includes the massive tail of contextually irrelevant tokens in the action space, which could distract the policy from focusing on decision-making among the truly reasonable tokens. In this work, we verify that valid reasoning paths could inherently concentrate within a low-rank subspace. Based on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Promising Tokens (RLPT), a framework that mitigates the action space issue by decoupling strategic decision-making from token generation. Specifically, RLPT leverages the semantic priors of the base model to identify a dynamic set of \emph{promising tokens} and constrains policy optimization exclusively to this refined subset via masking. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that RLPT effectively reduces gradient variance, stabilizes the training process, and improves sample efficiency. Experiment results on math, coding, and telecom reasoning show that RLPT outperforms standard RL baselines and integrates effectively across various model sizes (4B and 8B) and RL algorithms (GRPO and DAPO).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03195v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring the Role of Tracing in AI-Supported Planning for Algorithmic Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03197</link><description>arXiv:2602.03197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-powered planning tools show promise in supporting programming learners by enabling early, formative feedback on their thinking processes prior to coding. To date, however, most AI-supported planning tools rely on students' natural-language explanations, using LLMs to interpret learners' descriptions of their algorithmic intent. Prior to the emergence of LLM-based systems, CS education research extensively studied trace-based planning in pen-and-paper settings, demonstrating that reasoning through stepwise execution with explicit state transitions helps learners build and refine mental models of program behavior. Despite its potential, little is known about how tracing interacts with AI-mediated feedback and whether integrating tracing into AI-supported planning tools leads to different learning processes or interaction dynamics compared to natural-language-based planning alone. We study how requiring learners to produce explicit execution traces with an AI-supported planning tool affects their algorithmic reasoning. In a between-subjects study with 20 students, tracing shifted learners away from code-like, line-by-line descriptions toward more goal-driven reasoning about program behavior. Moreover, it led to more consistent partially correct solutions, although final coding performance remained comparable across conditions. Notably, tracing did not significantly affect the quality or reliability of LLM-generated feedback. These findings reveal tradeoffs in combining tracing with AI-supported planning and inform design guidelines for integrating natural language, tracing, and coding to support iterative reasoning throughout the programming process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03197v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Single Scan to Sequential Consistency: A New Paradigm for LIDAR Relocalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03198</link><description>arXiv:2602.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR relocalization aims to estimate the global 6-DoF pose of a sensor in the environment. However, existing regression-based approaches are prone to dynamic or ambiguous scenarios, as they either solely rely on single-frame inference or neglect the spatio-temporal consistency across scans. In this paper, we propose TempLoc, a new LiDAR relocalization framework that enhances the robustness of localization by effectively modeling sequential consistency. Specifically, a Global Coordinate Estimation module is first introduced to predict point-wise global coordinates and associated uncertainties for each LiDAR scan. A Prior Coordinate Generation module is then presented to estimate inter-frame point correspondences by the attention mechanism. Lastly, an Uncertainty-Guided Coordinate Fusion module is deployed to integrate both predictions of point correspondence in an end-to-end fashion, yielding a more temporally consistent and accurate global 6-DoF pose. Experimental results on the NCLT and Oxford Robot-Car benchmarks show that our TempLoc outperforms stateof-the-art methods by a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal-aware correspondence modeling in LiDAR relocalization. Our code will be released soon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03198v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hand3R: Online 4D Hand-Scene Reconstruction in the Wild</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03200</link><description>arXiv:2602.03200v1 Announce Type: new

By injecting high-fidelity hand priors into a persistent scene memory, our approach enables simultaneous reconstruction of accurate hand meshes and dense metric-scale scene geometry in a single forward pass. Experiments demonstrate that Hand3R bypasses the reliance on offline optimization and delivers competitive performance in both local hand reconstruction and global positioning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03200v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Scalar Rewards to Potential Trends: Shaping Potential Landscapes for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03201</link><description>arXiv:2602.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) achieves high sample efficiency by simulating future trajectories with learned dynamics and reward models. However, its effectiveness is severely compromised in sparse reward settings. The core limitation lies in the standard paradigm of regressing ground-truth scalar rewards: in sparse environments, this yields a flat, gradient-free landscape that fails to provide directional guidance for planning. To address this challenge, we propose Shaping Landscapes with Optimistic Potential Estimates (SLOPE), a novel framework that shifts reward modeling from predicting scalars to constructing informative potential landscapes. SLOPE employs optimistic distributional regression to estimate high-confidence upper bounds, which amplifies rare success signals and ensures sufficient exploration gradients. Evaluations on 30+ tasks across 5 benchmarks demonstrate that SLOPE consistently outperforms leading baselines in fully sparse, semi-sparse, and dense rewards.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03201v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ForesightKV: Optimizing KV Cache Eviction for Reasoning Models by Learning Long-Term Contribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03203</link><description>arXiv:2602.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning abilities by producing long reasoning traces. However, as the sequence length grows, the key-value (KV) cache expands linearly, incurring significant memory and computation costs. Existing KV cache eviction methods mitigate this issue by discarding less important KV pairs, but often fail to capture complex KV dependencies, resulting in performance degradation. To better balance efficiency and performance, we introduce ForesightKV, a training-based KV cache eviction framework that learns to predict which KV pairs to evict during long-text generations. We first design the Golden Eviction algorithm, which identifies the optimal eviction KV pairs at each step using future attention scores. These traces and the scores at each step are then distilled via supervised training with a Pairwise Ranking Loss. Furthermore, we formulate cache eviction as a Markov Decision Process and apply the GRPO algorithm to mitigate the significant language modeling loss increase on low-entropy tokens. Experiments on AIME2024 and AIME2025 benchmarks of three reasoning models demonstrate that ForesightKV consistently outperforms prior methods under only half the cache budget, while benefiting synergistically from both supervised and reinforcement learning approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03203v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparsity is Combinatorial Depth: Quantifying MoE Expressivity via Tropical Geometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03204</link><description>arXiv:2602.03204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures define the state-of-the-art, their theoretical success is often attributed to heuristic efficiency rather than geometric expressivity. In this work, we present the first analysis of MoE through the lens of tropical geometry, establishing that the Top-$k$ routing mechanism is algebraically isomorphic to the $k$-th elementary symmetric tropical polynomial. This isomorphism partitions the input space into the Normal Fan of a Hypersimplex, revealing that \textbf{sparsity is combinatorial depth} which scales geometric capacity by the binomial coefficient $\binom{N}{k}$. Moving beyond ambient bounds, we introduce the concept of \textit{Effective Capacity} under the Manifold Hypothesis. We prove that while dense networks suffer from capacity collapse on low-dimensional data, MoE architectures exhibit \textit{Combinatorial Resilience}, maintaining high expressivity via the transversality of routing cones. In this study, our framework unifies the discrete geometry of the Hypersimplex with the continuous geometry of neural functions, offering a rigorous theoretical justification for the topological supremacy of conditional computation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03204v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HUSKY: Humanoid Skateboarding System via Physics-Aware Whole-Body Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03205</link><description>arXiv:2602.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While current humanoid whole-body control frameworks predominantly rely on the static environment assumptions, addressing tasks characterized by high dynamism and complex interactions presents a formidable challenge. In this paper, we address humanoid skateboarding, a highly challenging task requiring stable dynamic maneuvering on an underactuated wheeled platform. This integrated system is governed by non-holonomic constraints and tightly coupled human-object interactions. Successfully executing this task requires simultaneous mastery of hybrid contact dynamics and robust balance control on a mechanically coupled, dynamically unstable skateboard. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose HUSKY, a learning-based framework that integrates humanoid-skateboard system modeling and physics-aware whole-body control. We first model the coupling relationship between board tilt and truck steering angles, enabling a principled analysis of system dynamics. Building upon this, HUSKY leverages Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to learn human-like pushing motions and employs a physics-guided, heading-oriented strategy for lean-to-steer behaviors. Moreover, a trajectory-guided mechanism ensures smooth and stable transitions between pushing and steering. Experimental results on the Unitree G1 humanoid platform demonstrate that our framework enables stable and agile maneuvering on skateboards in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling offers a versatile paradigm for aligning visual generative models with downstream objectives without parameter updates. However, existing approaches that optimize the high-dimensional initial noise suffer from severe inefficiency, as many search directions exert negligible influence on the final generation. We show that this inefficiency is closely related to a spectral bias in generative dynamics: model sensitivity to initial perturbations diminishes rapidly as frequency increases. Building on this insight, we propose Spectral Evolution Search (SES), a plug-and-play framework for initial noise optimization that executes gradient-free evolutionary search within a low-frequency subspace. Theoretically, we derive the Spectral Scaling Prediction from perturbation propagation dynamics, which explains the systematic differences in the impact of perturbations across frequencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SES significantly advances the Pareto frontier of generation quality versus computational cost, consistently outperforming strong baselines under equivalent budgets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03208v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Depth Completion in Unseen Field Robotics Environments Using Extremely Sparse Depth Measurements</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03209</link><description>arXiv:2602.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous field robots operating in unstructured environments require robust perception to ensure safe and reliable operations. Recent advances in monocular depth estimation have demonstrated the potential of low-cost cameras as depth sensors; however, their adoption in field robotics remains limited due to the absence of reliable scale cues, ambiguous or low-texture conditions, and the scarcity of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a depth completion model that trains on synthetic data and uses extremely sparse measurements from depth sensors to predict dense metric depth in unseen field robotics environments. A synthetic dataset generation pipeline tailored to field robotics enables the creation of multiple realistic datasets for training purposes. This dataset generation approach utilizes textured 3D meshes from Structure from Motion and photorealistic rendering with novel viewpoint synthesis to simulate diverse field robotics scenarios. Our approach achieves an end-to-end latency of 53 ms per frame on a Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin, enabling real-time deployment on embedded platforms. Extensive evaluation demonstrates competitive performance across diverse real-world field robotics scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03209v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VIRAL: Visual In-Context Reasoning via Analogy in Diffusion Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03210</link><description>arXiv:2602.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replicating In-Context Learning (ICL) in computer vision remains challenging due to task heterogeneity.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative performance; however, generated samples often fail to fully align with human intent. This paper studies a test-time scaling method that enables sampling from regions with higher human-aligned reward values. Existing gradient guidance methods approximate the expected future reward (EFR) at an intermediate particle $\mathbf{x}_t$ using a Taylor approximation, but this approximation at each time step incurs high computational cost due to sequential neural backpropagation. We show that the EFR at any $\mathbf{x}_t$ can be computed using only marginal samples from a pre-trained diffusion model. The proposed EFR formulation detaches the neural dependency between $\mathbf{x}_t$ and the EFR, enabling closed-form guidance computation without neural backpropagation. To further improve efficiency, we introduce lookahead sampling to collect marginal samples. For final sample generation, we use an accurate solver that guides particles toward high-reward lookahead samples. We refer to this sampling scheme as LiDAR sampling. LiDAR achieves substantial performance improvements using only three samples with a 3-step lookahead solver, exhibiting steep performance gains as lookahead accuracy and sample count increase; notably, it reaches the same GenEval performance as the latest gradient guidance method for SDXL with a 9.5x speedup.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03211v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ConsisDrive: Identity-Preserving Driving World Models for Video Generation by Instance Mask</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03213</link><description>arXiv:2602.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving relies on robust models trained on large-scale, high-quality multi-view driving videos. Although world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving data, they often suffer from identity drift, where the same object changes its appearance or category across frames due to the absence of instance-level temporal constraints. We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity. By integrating these mechanisms, ConsisDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving video generation quality and demonstrates significant improvements in downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

Abstract: Inference speed and tracking performance are two critical evaluation metrics in the field of visual tracking. However, high-performance trackers often suffer from slow processing speeds, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To alleviate this issue, we propose FARTrack, a Fast Auto-Regressive Tracking framework. Since autoregression emphasizes the temporal nature of the trajectory sequence, it can maintain high performance while achieving efficient execution across various devices. FARTrack introduces Task-Specific Self-Distillation and Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification, designed from the perspectives of shallow-yet-accurate distillation and redundant-to-essential token optimization, respectively. Task-Specific Self-Distillation achieves model compression by distilling task-specific tokens layer by layer, enhancing the model's inference speed while avoiding suboptimal manual teacher-student layer pairs assignments. Meanwhile, Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification sequentially condenses multiple templates, avoiding additional runtime overhead while learning a temporally-global optimal sparsification strategy. FARTrack demonstrates outstanding speed and competitive performance. It delivers an AO of 70.6% on GOT-10k in real-time. Beyond, our fastest model achieves a speed of 343 FPS on the GPU and 121 FPS on the CPU.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03214v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Token Sparse Attention: Efficient Long-Context Inference with Interleaved Token Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03216</link><description>arXiv:2602.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention remains the central bottleneck in long-context inference for large language models. Prior acceleration methods either sparsify the attention map with structured patterns or permanently evict tokens at specific layers, which can retain irrelevant tokens or rely on irreversible early decisions despite the layer-/head-wise dynamics of token importance. In this paper, we propose Token Sparse Attention, a lightweight and dynamic token-level sparsification mechanism that compresses per-head $Q$, $K$, $V$ to a reduced token set during attention and then decompresses the output back to the original sequence, enabling token information to be reconsidered in subsequent layers. Furthermore, Token Sparse Attention exposes a new design point at the intersection of token selection and sparse attention. Our approach is fully compatible with dense attention implementations, including Flash Attention, and can be seamlessly composed with existing sparse attention kernels. Experimental results show that Token Sparse Attention consistently improves accuracy-latency trade-off, achieving up to $\times$3.23 attention speedup at 128K context with less than 1% accuracy degradation. These results demonstrate that dynamic and interleaved token-level sparsification is a complementary and effective strategy for scalable long-context inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03216v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Topology Matters: A Cautionary Case Study of Graph SSL on Neuro-Inspired Benchmarks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03217</link><description>arXiv:2602.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how local interactions give rise to global brain organization requires models that can represent information across multiple scales. We introduce a hierarchical self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that jointly learns node-, edge-, and graph-level embeddings, inspired by multimodal neuroimaging. We construct a controllable synthetic benchmark mimicking the topological properties of connectomes. Our four-stage evaluation protocol reveals a critical failure: the invariance-based SSL model is fundamentally misaligned with the benchmark's topological properties and is catastrophically outperformed by classical, topology-aware heuristics. Ablations confirm an objective mismatch: SSL objectives designed to be invariant to topological perturbations learn to ignore the very community structure that classical methods exploit. Our results expose a fundamental pitfall in applying generic graph SSL to connectome-like data. We present this framework as a cautionary case study, highlighting the need for new, topology-aware SSL objectives for neuro-AI research that explicitly reward the preservation of structure (e.g., modularity or motifs).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03217v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Quantity: Trajectory Diversity Scaling for Code Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03219</link><description>arXiv:2602.03219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PokeFusion Attention: Enhancing Reference-Free Style-Conditioned Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03220</link><description>arXiv:2602.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies reference-free style-conditioned character generation in text-to-image diffusion models, where high-quality synthesis requires both stable character structure and consistent, fine-grained style expression across diverse prompts. Existing approaches primarily rely on text-only prompting, which is often under-specified for visual style and tends to produce noticeable style drift and geometric inconsistency, or introduce reference-based adapters that depend on external images at inference time, increasing architectural complexity and limiting deployment flexibility.We propose PokeFusion Attention, a lightweight decoder-level cross-attention mechanism that fuses textual semantics with learned style embeddings directly inside the diffusion decoder. By decoupling text and style conditioning at the attention level, our method enables effective reference-free stylized generation while keeping the pretrained diffusion backbone fully frozen.PokeFusion Attention trains only decoder cross-attention layers together with a compact style projection module, resulting in a parameter-efficient and plug-and-play control component that can be easily integrated into existing diffusion pipelines and transferred across different backbones.Experiments on a stylized character generation benchmark (Pokemon-style) demonstrate that our method consistently improves style fidelity, semantic alignment, and character shape consistency compared with representative adapter-based baselines, while maintaining low parameter overhead and inference-time simplicity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03220v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distribution-Aware End-to-End Embedding for Streaming Numerical Features in Click-Through Rate Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03223</link><description>arXiv:2602.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores effective numerical feature embedding for Click-Through Rate prediction in streaming environments. Conventional static binning methods rely on offline statistics of numerical distributions; however, this inherently two-stage process often triggers semantic drift during bin boundary updates. While neural embedding methods enable end-to-end learning, they often discard explicit distributional information. Integrating such information end-to-end is challenging because streaming features often violate the i.i.d. assumption, precluding unbiased estimation of the population distribution via the expectation of order statistics. Furthermore, the critical context dependency of numerical distributions is often neglected. To this end, we propose DAES, an end-to-end framework designed to tackle numerical feature embedding in streaming training scenarios by integrating distributional information with an adaptive modulation mechanism. Specifically, we introduce an efficient reservoir-sampling-based distribution estimation method and two field-aware distribution modulation strategies to capture streaming distributions and field-dependent semantics. DAES significantly outperforms existing approaches as demonstrated by extensive offline and online experiments and has been fully deployed on a leading short-video platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03223v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TAME: A Trustworthy Test-Time Evolution of Agent Memory with Systematic Benchmarking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03224</link><description>arXiv:2602.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time evolution of agent memory serves as a pivotal paradigm for achieving AGI by bolstering complex reasoning through experience accumulation. However, even during benign task evolution, agent safety alignment remains vulnerable-a phenomenon known as Agent Memory Misevolution. To evaluate this phenomenon, we construct the Trust-Memevo benchmark to assess multi-dimensional trustworthiness during benign task evolution, revealing an overall decline in trustworthiness across various task domains and evaluation settings. To address this issue, we propose TAME, a dual-memory evolutionary framework that separately evolves executor memory to improve task performance by distilling generalizable methodologies, and evaluator memory to refine assessments of both safety and task utility based on historical feedback. Through a closed loop of memory filtering, draft generation, trustworthy refinement, execution, and dual-track memory updating, TAME preserves trustworthiness without sacrificing utility. Experiments demonstrate that TAME mitigates misevolution, achieving a joint improvement in both trustworthiness and task performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03224v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ATACompressor: Adaptive Task-Aware Compression for Efficient Long-Context Processing in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03226</link><description>arXiv:2602.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context inputs in large language models (LLMs) often suffer from the "lost in the middle" problem, where critical information becomes diluted or ignored due to excessive length. Context compression methods aim to address this by reducing input size, but existing approaches struggle with balancing information preservation and compression efficiency. We propose Adaptive Task-Aware Compressor (ATACompressor), which dynamically adjusts compression based on the specific requirements of the task. ATACompressor employs a selective encoder that compresses only the task-relevant portions of long contexts, ensuring that essential information is preserved while reducing unnecessary content. Its adaptive allocation controller perceives the length of relevant content and adjusts the compression rate accordingly, optimizing resource utilization. We evaluate ATACompressor on three QA datasets: HotpotQA, MSMARCO, and SQUAD-showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both compression efficiency and task performance. Our approach provides a scalable solution for long-context processing in LLMs. Furthermore, we perform a range of ablation studies and analysis experiments to gain deeper insights into the key components of ATACompressor.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03226v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spiral RoPE: Rotate Your Rotary Positional Embeddings in the 2D Plane</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03227</link><description>arXiv:2602.03227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is the de facto positional encoding in large language models due to its ability to encode relative positions and support length extrapolation. When adapted to vision transformers, the standard axial formulation decomposes two-dimensional spatial positions into horizontal and vertical components, implicitly restricting positional encoding to axis-aligned directions. We identify this directional constraint as a fundamental limitation of the standard axial 2D RoPE, which hinders the modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spiral RoPE, a simple yet effective extension that enables multi-directional positional encoding by partitioning embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of the patch position onto its corresponding direction, allowing spatial relationships to be encoded beyond the horizontal and vertical axes. Across a wide range of vision tasks including classification, segmentation, and generation, Spiral RoPE consistently improves performance. Qualitative analysis of attention maps further show that Spiral RoPE exhibits more concentrated activations on semantically relevant objects and better respects local object boundaries, highlighting the importance of multi-directional positional encoding in vision transformers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03227v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Omnidirectional Solid-State mmWave Radar Perception for UAV Power Line Collision Avoidance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03229</link><description>arXiv:2602.03229v1 Announce Type: new

We characterize the sensing behavior of this omnidirectional radar arrangement in power line environments and develop a robust detection-and-avoidance algorithm tailored to that behavior. Field experiments on real power lines demonstrate reliable detection at ranges up to 10 m, successful avoidance maneuvers at flight speeds upwards of 10 m/s, and detection of wires as thin as 1.2 mm in diameter.

Abstract: Event-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable robust perception in high-speed and low-light scenarios, addressing key limitations of frame-based MLLMs. However, current event-based MLLMs often rely on dense image-like processing paradigms, overlooking the spatiotemporal sparsity of event streams and resulting in high computational cost. In this paper, we propose EventFlash, a novel and efficient MLLM to explore spatiotemporal token sparsification for reducing data redundancy and accelerating inference. Technically, we build EventMind, a large-scale and scene-diverse dataset with over 500k instruction sets, providing both short and long event stream sequences to support our curriculum training strategy. We then present an adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, which adaptively compresses temporal tokens while retaining key temporal cues. Finally, a sparse density-guided attention module is designed to improve spatial token efficiency by selecting informative regions and suppressing empty or sparse areas. Experimental results show that EventFlash achieves a $12.4\times$ throughput improvement over the baseline (EventFlash-Zero) while maintaining comparable performance. It supports long-range event stream processing with up to 1,000 bins, significantly outperforming the 5-bin limit of EventGPT. We believe EventFlash serves as an efficient foundation model for event-based vision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BayeSQP: Bayesian Optimization through Sequential Quadratic Programming</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03232</link><description>arXiv:2602.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce BayeSQP, a novel algorithm for general black-box optimization that merges the structure of sequential quadratic programming with concepts from Bayesian optimization. BayeSQP employs second-order Gaussian process surrogates for both the objective and constraints to jointly model the function values, gradients, and Hessian from only zero-order information. At each iteration, a local subproblem is constructed using the GP posterior estimates and solved to obtain a search direction. Crucially, the formulation of the subproblem explicitly incorporates uncertainty in both the function and derivative estimates, resulting in a tractable second-order cone program for high probability improvements under model uncertainty. A subsequent one-dimensional line search via constrained Thompson sampling selects the next evaluation point. Empirical results show thatBayeSQP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in specific high-dimensional settings. Our algorithm offers a principled and flexible framework that bridges classical optimization techniques with modern approaches to black-box optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03232v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Merging Beyond: Streaming LLM Updates via Activation-Guided Rotations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03237</link><description>arXiv:2602.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient adaptation techniques. Model merging has gained prominence for its efficiency and controllability. However, existing merging techniques typically serve as post-hoc refinements or focus on mitigating task interference, often failing to capture the dynamic optimization benefits of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose Streaming Merging, an innovative model updating paradigm that conceptualizes merging as an iterative optimization process. Central to this paradigm is \textbf{ARM} (\textbf{A}ctivation-guided \textbf{R}otation-aware \textbf{M}erging), a strategy designed to approximate gradient descent dynamics. By treating merging coefficients as learning rates and deriving rotation vectors from activation subspaces, ARM effectively steers parameter updates along data-driven trajectories. Unlike conventional linear interpolation, ARM aligns semantic subspaces to preserve the geometric structure of high-dimensional parameter evolution. Remarkably, ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and, through iterative merging, surpasses the fully converged SFT model. Experimental results across model scales (1.7B to 14B) and diverse domains (e.g., math, code) demonstrate that ARM can transcend converged checkpoints. Extensive experiments show that ARM provides a scalable and lightweight framework for efficient model adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03237v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Necessity of a Unified Framework for LLM-Based Agent Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03238</link><description>arXiv:2602.03238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks. We observe that current agent benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors, including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself. Additionally, the lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results. This lack of standardization introduces substantial unfairness and opacity into the field. We propose that a unified evaluation framework is essential for the rigorous advancement of agent evaluation. To this end, we introduce a proposal aimed at standardizing agent evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03238v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] InstaDrive: Instance-Aware Driving World Models for Realistic and Consistent Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03242</link><description>arXiv:2602.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving relies on robust models trained on high-quality, large-scale multi-view driving videos. While world models offer a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving videos, they struggle to maintain instance-level temporal consistency and spatial geometric fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose InstaDrive, a novel framework that enhances driving video realism through two key advancements: (1) Instance Flow Guider, which extracts and propagates instance features across frames to enforce temporal consistency, preserving instance identity over time. (2) Spatial Geometric Aligner, which improves spatial reasoning, ensures precise instance positioning, and explicitly models occlusion hierarchies.

Abstract: The random feature method (RFM) constructs approximation spaces by initializing features from generic distributions, which provides universal approximation properties to solve general partial differential equations. However, such standard initializations lack awareness of the underlying physical laws and geometry, which limits approximation. In this work, we propose the Physics-Driven Orthogonal Feature Method (PD-OFM), a framework for constructing feature representations that are explicitly tailored to both the differential operator and the computational domain by pretraining features using physics-informed objectives together with orthogonality regularization. This pretraining strategy yields nearly orthogonal feature bases. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that physics-informed pretraining improves the approximation capability of the learned feature space. When employed to solve Helmholtz, Poisson, wave, and Navier-Stokes equations, the proposed method achieves residual errors 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than those of comparable methods. Furthermore, the orthogonality regularization improves transferability, enabling pretrained features to generalize effectively across different source terms and domain geometries for the same PDE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03247v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A thin and soft optical tactile sensor for highly sensitive object perception</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03248</link><description>arXiv:2602.03248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial in robotics and wearable devices for safe perception and interaction with the environment. Optical tactile sensors have emerged as promising solutions, as they are immune to electromagnetic interference and have high spatial resolution. However, existing optical approaches, particularly vision-based tactile sensors, rely on complex optical assemblies that involve lenses and cameras, resulting in bulky, rigid, and alignment-sensitive designs. In this study, we present a thin, compact, and soft optical tactile sensor featuring an alignment-free configuration. The soft optical sensor operates by capturing deformation-induced changes in speckle patterns generated within a soft silicone material, thereby enabling precise force measurements and texture recognition via machine learning. The experimental results show a root-mean-square error of 40 mN in the force measurement and a classification accuracy of 93.33% over nine classes of textured surfaces, including Mahjong tiles. The proposed speckle-based approach provides a compact, easily fabricated, and mechanically compliant platform that bridges optical sensing with flexible shape-adaptive architectures, thereby demonstrating its potential as a novel tactile-sensing paradigm for soft robotics and wearable haptic interfaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03248v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accordion-Thinking: Self-Regulated Step Summaries for Efficient and Readable LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03249</link><description>arXiv:2602.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling test-time compute via long Chain-ofThought unlocks remarkable gains in reasoning capabilities, yet it faces practical limits due to the linear growth of KV cache and quadratic attention complexity. In this paper, we introduce Accordion-Thinking, an end-to-end framework where LLMs learn to self-regulate the granularity of the reasoning steps through dynamic summarization. This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03249v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Collision Detection with Analytical Derivatives of Contact Kinematics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03250</link><description>arXiv:2602.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable contact kinematics are essential for gradient-based methods in robotics, yet the mapping from robot state to contact distance, location, and normal becomes non-smooth in degenerate configurations of shapes with zero or undefined curvature. We address this inherent limitation by selectively regularizing such geometries into strictly convex implicit representations, restoring uniqueness and smoothness of the contact map. Leveraging this geometric regularization, we develop iDCOL, an implicit differentiable collision detection and contact kinematics framework. iDCOL represents colliding bodies using strictly convex implicit surfaces and computes collision detection and contact kinematics by solving a fixed-size nonlinear system derived from a geometric scaling-based convex optimization formulation. By applying the Implicit Function Theorem to the resulting system residual, we derive analytical derivatives of the contact kinematic quantities. We develop a fast Newton-based solver for iDCOL and provide an open-source C++ implementation of the framework. The robustness of the approach is evaluated through extensive collision simulations and benchmarking, and applicability is demonstrated in gradient-based kinematic path planning and differentiable contact physics, including multi-body rigid collisions and a soft-robot interaction example.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03250v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LaVPR: Benchmarking Language and Vision for Place Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03253</link><description>arXiv:2602.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) often fails under extreme environmental changes and perceptual aliasing. Furthermore, standard systems cannot perform "blind" localization from verbal descriptions alone, a capability needed for applications such as emergency response. To address these challenges, we introduce LaVPR, a large-scale benchmark that extends existing VPR datasets with over 650,000 rich natural-language descriptions. Using LaVPR, we investigate two paradigms: Multi-Modal Fusion for enhanced robustness and Cross-Modal Retrieval for language-based localization. Our results show that language descriptions yield consistent gains in visually degraded conditions, with the most significant impact on smaller backbones. Notably, adding language allows compact models to rival the performance of much larger vision-only architectures. For cross-modal retrieval, we establish a baseline using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Multi-Similarity loss, which substantially outperforms standard contrastive methods across vision-language models. Ultimately, LaVPR enables a new class of localization systems that are both resilient to real-world stochasticity and practical for resource-constrained deployment. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/oferidan1/LaVPR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03253v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LPS-Bench: Benchmarking Safety Awareness of Computer-Use Agents in Long-Horizon Planning under Benign and Adversarial Scenarios</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03255</link><description>arXiv:2602.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) that interact with real computer systems can perform automated tasks but face critical safety risks. Ambiguous instructions may trigger harmful actions, and adversarial users can manipulate tool execution to achieve malicious goals. Existing benchmarks mostly focus on short-horizon or GUI-based tasks, evaluating on execution-time errors but overlooking the ability to anticipate planning-time risks. To fill this gap, we present LPS-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates the planning-time safety awareness of MCP-based CUAs under long-horizon tasks, covering both benign and adversarial interactions across 65 scenarios of 7 task domains and 9 risk types. We introduce a multi-agent automated pipeline for scalable data generation and adopt an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess safety awareness through the planning trajectory. Experiments reveal substantial deficiencies in existing CUAs' ability to maintain safe behavior. We further analyze the risks and propose mitigation strategies to improve long-horizon planning safety in MCP-based CUA systems. We open-source our code at https://github.com/tychenn/LPS-Bench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03255v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Impact of Physics-Informed Features on Neural Network Complexity for Li-ion Battery Voltage Prediction in Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Aircrafts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03256</link><description>arXiv:2602.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft demands high-fidelity battery management systems capable of predicting voltage response under aggressive power dynamics. While data-driven models offer high accuracy, they often require complex architectures and extensive training data. Conversely, equivalent circuit models (ECMs), such as the second-order model, offer physical interpretability but struggle with high C-rate non-linearities. This paper investigates the impact of integrating physics-based information into data-driven surrogate models. Specifically, we evaluate whether physics-informed features allow for the simplification of neural network architectures without compromising accuracy. Using the open-source electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) battery dataset, we compare pure data-driven models against physics-informed data models. Results demonstrate that physics-informed models achieve comparable accuracy to complex pure data-driven models while using up to 75% fewer trainable parameters, significantly reducing computational overhead for potential on-board deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03256v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GraDE: A Graph Diffusion Estimator for Frequent Subgraph Discovery in Neural Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03257</link><description>arXiv:2602.03257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding frequently occurring subgraph patterns or network motifs in neural architectures is crucial for optimizing efficiency, accelerating design, and uncovering structural insights. However, as the subgraph size increases, enumeration-based methods are perfectly accurate but computationally prohibitive, while sampling-based methods are computationally tractable but suffer from a severe decline in discovery capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes GraDE, a diffusion-guided search framework that ensures both computational feasibility and discovery capability. The key innovation is the Graph Diffusion Estimator (GraDE), which is the first to introduce graph diffusion models to identify frequent subgraphs by scoring their typicality within the learned distribution. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the estimator achieves superior ranking accuracy, with up to 114\% improvement compared to sampling-based baselines. Benefiting from this, the proposed framework successfully discovers large-scale frequent patterns, achieving up to 30$\times$ higher median frequency than sampling-based methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03257v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Context-Aware Edge-Cloud Continuum Orchestration for Multi-user XR Services</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03262</link><description>arXiv:2602.03262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of multi-user eXtended Reality (XR) applications, spanning fields such as entertainment, education, and telemedicine, demands seamless, immersive experiences for users interacting within shared, distributed environments. Delivering such latency-sensitive experiences involves considerable challenges in orchestrating network, computing, and service resources, where existing limitations highlight the need for a structured approach to analyse and optimise these complex systems. This challenge is amplified by the need for high-performance, low-latency connectivity, where 5G and 6G networks provide essential infrastructure to meet the requirements of XR services at scale. This article addresses these challenges by developing a model that parametrises multi-user XR services across four critical layers of the standard virtualisation architecture. We formalise this model mathematically, proposing a context-aware framework that defines key parameters at each level and integrates them into a comprehensive Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration strategy. Our contributions include a detailed analysis of the current limitations and needs in existing Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration approaches, the formulation of a layered mathematical model, and a validation framework that demonstrates the utility and feasibility of the proposed solution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03262v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CSR-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Cross-modal Safety and Reliability of MLLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03263</link><description>arXiv:2602.03263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable interaction over both text and images, but their safety behavior can be driven by unimodal shortcuts instead of true joint intent understanding. We introduce CSR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reliability through four stress-testing interaction patterns spanning Safety, Over-rejection, Bias, and Hallucination, covering 61 fine-grained types. Each instance is constructed to require integrated image-text interpretation, and we additionally provide paired text-only controls to diagnose modality-induced behavior shifts. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe systematic cross-modal alignment gaps. Models show weak safety awareness, strong language dominance under interference, and consistent performance degradation from text-only controls to multimodal inputs. We also observe a clear trade-off between reducing over-rejection and maintaining safe, non-discriminatory behavior, suggesting that some apparent safety gains may come from refusal-oriented heuristics rather than robust intent understanding.

Abstract: Robust generalization beyond training distributions remains a critical challenge for deep neural networks. This is especially pronounced in medical image analysis, where data is often scarce and covariate shifts arise from different hardware devices, imaging protocols, and heterogeneous patient populations. These factors collectively hinder reliable performance and slow down clinical adoption. Despite recent progress, existing learning paradigms primarily rely on the Euclidean manifold, whose flat geometry fails to capture the complex, hierarchical structures present in clinical data. In this work, we exploit the advantages of hyperbolic manifolds to model complex data characteristics. We present the first comprehensive validation of hyperbolic representation learning for medical image analysis and demonstrate statistically significant gains across eleven in-distribution datasets and three ViT models. We further propose an unsupervised, domain-invariant hyperbolic cross-branch consistency constraint. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed method promotes domain-invariant features and outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean methods by an average of $+2.1\%$ AUC on three domain generalization benchmarks: Fitzpatrick17k, Camelyon17-WILDS, and a cross-dataset setup for retinal imaging. These datasets span different imaging modalities, data sizes, and label granularities, confirming generalization capabilities across substantially different conditions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption across multiple domains, creating an urgent need for robust safety alignment mechanisms. However, robustness remains challenging due to jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment via adversarial prompts. In this work, we focus on the prevalent Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack and identify a previously underexplored attack axis in jailbreak attacks typically framed as suffix-based: the placement of adversarial tokens within the prompt. Using GCG as a case study, we show that both optimizing attacks to generate prefixes instead of suffixes and varying adversarial token position during evaluation substantially influence attack success rates. Our findings highlight a critical blind spot in current safety evaluations and underline the need to account for the position of adversarial tokens in the adversarial robustness evaluation of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03265v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling Covert Toxicity in Multimodal Data via Toxicity Association Graphs: A Graph-Based Metric and Interpretable Detection Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03268</link><description>arXiv:2602.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting toxicity in multimodal data remains a significant challenge, as harmful meanings often lurk beneath seemingly benign individual modalities: only emerging when modalities are combined and semantic associations are activated. To address this, we propose a novel detection framework based on Toxicity Association Graphs (TAGs), which systematically model semantic associations between innocuous entities and latent toxic implications. Leveraging TAGs, we introduce the first quantifiable metric for hidden toxicity, the Multimodal Toxicity Covertness (MTC), which measures the degree of concealment in toxic multimodal expressions. By integrating our detection framework with the MTC metric, our approach enables precise identification of covert toxicity while preserving full interpretability of the decision-making process, significantly enhancing transparency in multimodal toxicity detection. To validate our method, we construct the Covert Toxic Dataset, the first benchmark specifically designed to capture high-covertness toxic multimodal instances. This dataset encodes nuanced cross-modal associations and serves as a rigorous testbed for evaluating both the proposed metric and detection framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across both low- and high-covertness toxicity regimes, while delivering clear, interpretable, and auditable detection outcomes. Together, our contributions advance the state of the art in explainable multimodal toxicity detection and lay the foundation for future context-aware and interpretable approaches.

Abstract: Business logic vulnerabilities have become one of the most damaging yet least understood classes of smart contract vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional bugs such as reentrancy or arithmetic errors, these vulnerabilities arise from missing or incorrectly enforced business invariants and are tightly coupled with protocol semantics. Existing static analysis techniques struggle to capture such high-level logic, while recent large language model based approaches often suffer from unstable outputs and low accuracy due to hallucination and limited verification.
  In this paper, we propose LogicScan, an automated contrastive auditing framework for detecting business logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The key insight behind LogicScan is that mature, widely deployed on-chain protocols implicitly encode well-tested and consensus-driven business invariants. LogicScan systematically mines these invariants from large-scale on-chain contracts and reuses them as reference constraints to audit target contracts. To achieve this, LogicScan introduces a Business Specification Language (BSL) to normalize diverse implementation patterns into structured, verifiable logic representations. It further combines noise-aware logic aggregation with contrastive auditing to identify missing or weakly enforced invariants while mitigating LLM-induced false positives.
  We evaluate LogicScan on three real-world datasets, including DeFiHacks, Web3Bugs, and a set of top-200 audited contracts. The results show that LogicScan achieves an F1 score of 85.2%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art tools while maintaining a low false-positive rate on production-grade contracts. Additional experiments demonstrate that LogicScan maintains consistent performance across different LLMs and is cost-effective, and that its false-positive suppression mechanisms substantially improve robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03271v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Power Reserve Procurement Considering Dependent Random Variables with PCE</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03272</link><description>arXiv:2602.03272v1 Announce Type: new

Arbitrary dependencies are modelled by using Gaussian copulas to construct the joint distribution.

Abstract: Soundness and completeness with respect to equational theories for programming languages are fundamental properties in the study of categorical semantics. However, completeness results have not been established for programming languages with algebraic effects and handlers, which raises a question of whether the commonly used models in the literature, i.e., free model monads generated from algebraic theories, are the only valid semantic models for effect handlers. In this paper, we show that this is not the case. We identify the precise characterizations of categorical models of effect handlers that allow us to establish soundness and completeness results with respect to a certain equational theory for effect handling constructs. Notably, this allows us to capture not only free monad models but also the CPS semantics for effect handlers as models of the calculus.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03275v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BlockRR: A Unified Framework of RR-type Algorithms for Label Differential Privacy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03277</link><description>arXiv:2602.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BlockRR, a novel and unified randomized-response mechanism for label differential privacy. This framework generalizes existed RR-type mechanisms as special cases under specific parameter settings, which eliminates the need for separate, case-by-case analysis. Theoretically, we prove that BlockRR satisfies $\epsilon$-label DP. We also design a partition method for BlockRR based on a weight matrix derived from label prior information; the parallel composition principle ensures that the composition of two such mechanisms remains $\epsilon$-label DP. Empirically, we evaluate BlockRR on two variants of CIFAR-10 with varying degrees of class imbalance. Results show that in the high-privacy and moderate-privacy regimes ($\epsilon \leq 3.0$), our propsed method gets a better balance between test accuaracy and the average of per-class accuracy. In the low-privacy regime ($\epsilon \geq 4.0$), all methods reduce BlockRR to standard RR without additional performance loss.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03277v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Pipeline for ADNI Resting-State Functional MRI Processing and Quality Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03278</link><description>arXiv:2602.03278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) provides a comprehensive multimodal neuroimaging resource for studying aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since its second wave, ADNI has increasingly collected resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), a valuable resource for discovering brain connectivity changes predictive of cognitive decline and AD. A major barrier to its use is the considerable variability in acquisition protocols and data quality, compounded by missing imaging sessions and inconsistencies in how functional scans temporally align with clinical assessments. As a result, many studies only utilize a small subset of the total rs-fMRI data, limiting statistical power, reproducibility, and the ability to study longitudinal functional brain changes at scale. Here, we describe a pipeline for ADNI rs-fMRI data that encompasses the download of necessary imaging and clinical data, temporally aligning the clinical and imaging data, preprocessing, and quality control. We integrate data curation and preprocessing across all ADNI sites and scanner types using a combination of open-source software (Clinica, fMRIPrep, and MRIQC) and bespoke tools. Quality metrics and reports are generated for each subject and session to facilitate rigorous data screening. All scripts and configuration files are available to enable reproducibility. The pipeline, which currently supports ADNI-GO, ADNI-2, and ADNI-3 data releases, outputs high-quality rs-fMRI time series data adhering to the BIDS-derivatives specification. This protocol provides a transparent and scalable framework for curating and utilizing ADNI fMRI data, empowering large-scale functional biomarker discovery and integrative multimodal analyses in Alzheimer's disease research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03278v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Proposing: Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning via Compositional Skill Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03279</link><description>arXiv:2602.03279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing complex reasoning in large language models relies on high-quality, verifiable datasets, yet human annotation remains cost-prohibitive and difficult to scale. Current synthesis paradigms often face a recurring trade-off: maintaining structural validity typically restricts problem complexity, while relaxing constraints to increase difficulty frequently leads to inconsistent or unsolvable instances. To address this, we propose Agentic Proposing, a framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through an iterative workflow of internal reflection and tool-use, we develop the Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science. Empirical results demonstrate that downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and exhibit robust cross-domain generalization. Notably, a 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves a state-of-the-art 91.6% accuracy on AIME25, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models such as GPT-5 and proving that a small volume of high-quality synthetic signals can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03279v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Global Geometry Is Not Enough for Vision Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03282</link><description>arXiv:2602.03282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common assumption in representation learning is that globally well-distributed embeddings support robust and generalizable representations. This focus has shaped both training objectives and evaluation protocols, implicitly treating global geometry as a proxy for representational competence. While global geometry effectively encodes which elements are present, it is often insensitive to how they are composed. We investigate this limitation by testing the ability of geometric metrics to predict compositional binding across 21 vision encoders. We find that standard geometry-based statistics exhibit near-zero correlation with compositional binding. In contrast, functional sensitivity, as measured by the input-output Jacobian, reliably tracks this capability. We further provide an analytic account showing that this disparity arises from objective design, as existing losses explicitly constrain embedding geometry but leave the local input-output mapping unconstrained. These results suggest that global embedding geometry captures only a partial view of representational competence and establish functional sensitivity as a critical complementary axis for modeling composite structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03282v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Time Is All It Takes: Spike-Retiming Attacks on Event-Driven Spiking Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03284</link><description>arXiv:2602.03284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) compute with discrete spikes and exploit temporal structure, yet most adversarial attacks change intensities or event counts instead of timing. We study a timing-only adversary that retimes existing spikes while preserving spike counts and amplitudes in event-driven SNNs, thus remaining rate-preserving. We formalize a capacity-1 spike-retiming threat model with a unified trio of budgets: per-spike jitter $\mathcal{B}_{\infty}$, total delay $\mathcal{B}_{1}$, and tamper count $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Feasible adversarial examples must satisfy timeline consistency and non-overlap, which makes the search space discrete and constrained. To optimize such retimings at scale, we use projected-in-the-loop (PIL) optimization: shift-probability logits yield a differentiable soft retiming for backpropagation, and a strict projection in the forward pass produces a feasible discrete schedule that satisfies capacity-1, non-overlap, and the chosen budget at every step. The objective maximizes task loss on the projected input and adds a capacity regularizer together with budget-aware penalties, which stabilizes gradients and aligns optimization with evaluation. Across event-driven benchmarks (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST) and diverse SNN architectures, we evaluate under binary and integer event grids and a range of retiming budgets, and also test models trained with timing-aware adversarial training designed to counter timing-only attacks. For example, on DVS-Gesture the attack attains high success (over $90\%$) while touching fewer than $2\%$ of spikes under $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Taken together, our results show that spike retiming is a practical and stealthy attack surface that current defenses struggle to counter, providing a clear reference for temporal robustness in event-driven SNNs.

Abstract: Enterprise meeting environments require AI assistants that handle diverse operational tasks, from rapid fact checking during live discussions to cross meeting analysis for strategic planning, under strict latency, cost, and privacy constraints. Existing meeting benchmarks mainly focus on simplified question answering and fail to reflect real world enterprise workflows, where queries arise organically from multi stakeholder collaboration, span long temporal contexts, and require tool augmented reasoning.
  We address this gap through a grounded dataset and a learned agent framework. First, we introduce MeetAll, a bilingual and multimodal corpus derived from 231 enterprise meetings totaling 140 hours. Questions are injected using an enterprise informed protocol validated by domain expert review and human discriminability studies. Unlike purely synthetic benchmarks, this protocol is grounded in four enterprise critical dimensions: cognitive load, temporal context span, domain expertise, and actionable task execution, calibrated through interviews with stakeholders across finance, healthcare, and technology sectors.
  Second, we propose MeetBench XL, a multi dimensional evaluation protocol aligned with human judgment that measures factual fidelity, intent alignment, response efficiency, structural clarity, and completeness. Third, we present MeetMaster XL, a learned dual policy agent that jointly optimizes query routing between fast and slow reasoning paths and tool invocation, including retrieval, cross meeting aggregation, and web search. A lightweight classifier enables accurate routing with minimal overhead, achieving a superior quality latency tradeoff over single model baselines. Experiments against commercial systems show consistent gains, supported by ablations, robustness tests, and a real world deployment case study.Resources: https://github.com/huyuelin/MeetBench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Algorithm for Monitoring Edge-geodetic Sets in Chordal Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03288</link><description>arXiv:2602.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set (or meg-set for short) of a graph is a set of vertices $M$ such that if any edge is removed, then the distance between some two vertices of $M$ increases. This notion was introduced by Foucaud et al. in 2023 as a way to monitor networks for communication failures. As computing a minimal meg-set is hard in general, recent works aimed to find polynomial-time algorithms to compute minimal meg-sets when the input belongs to a restricted class of graphs. Most of these results are based on the property of some classes of graphs to admit a unique minimum meg-set, which is then easy to compute. In this work, we prove that chordal graphs also admit a unique minimal meg-set, answering a standing open question of Foucaud et al.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03288v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Universal Approximation of Continuous Functionals on Compact Subsets via Linear Measurements and Scalar Nonlinearities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03290</link><description>arXiv:2602.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study universal approximation of continuous functionals on compact subsets of products of Hilbert spaces. We prove that any such functional can be uniformly approximated by models that first take finitely many continuous linear measurements of the inputs and then combine these measurements through continuous scalar nonlinearities. We also extend the approximation principle to maps with values in a Banach space, yielding finite-rank approximations.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a practical solution for deploying image segmentation models under domain shift without accessing source data or retraining. Among existing TTA strategies, pseudo-label-based methods have shown promising performance. However, they often rely on perturbation-ensemble heuristics (e.g., dropout sampling, test-time augmentation, Gaussian noise), which lack distributional grounding and yield unstable training signals. This can trigger error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. To address this, we propose \textbf{A3-TTA}, a TTA framework that constructs reliable pseudo-labels through anchor-guided supervision. Specifically, we identify well-predicted target domain images using a class compact density metric, under the assumption that confident predictions imply distributional proximity to the source domain. These anchors serve as stable references to guide pseudo-label generation, which is further regularized via semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization. Additionally, we introduce a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to mitigate label noise and stabilize model update during adaptation. Evaluated on both multi-domain medical images (heart structure and prostate segmentation) and natural images, A3-TTA significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points compared to the source model, outperforming several state-of-the-art TTA methods under different segmentation model architectures. A3-TTA also excels in continual TTA, maintaining high performance across sequential target domains with strong anti-forgetting ability. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/A3-TTA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03292v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Anomaly Detection via Mean Shift Density Enhancement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03293</link><description>arXiv:2602.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection stands as an important problem in machine learning, with applications in financial fraud prevention, network security and medical diagnostics. Existing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms rarely perform well across different anomaly types, often excelling only under specific structural assumptions. This lack of robustness also becomes particularly evident under noisy settings. We propose Mean Shift Density Enhancement (MSDE), a fully unsupervised framework that detects anomalies through their geometric response to density-driven manifold evolution. MSDE is based on the principle that normal samples, being well supported by local density, remain stable under iterative density enhancement, whereas anomalous samples undergo large cumulative displacements as they are attracted toward nearby density modes. To operationalize this idea, MSDE employs a weighted mean-shift procedure with adaptive, sample-specific density weights derived from a UMAP-based fuzzy neighborhood graph. Anomaly scores are defined by the total displacement accumulated across a small number of mean-shift iterations. We evaluate MSDE on the ADBench benchmark, comprising forty six real-world tabular datasets, four realistic anomaly generation mechanisms, and six noise levels. Compared to 13 established unsupervised baselines, MSDE achieves consistently strong, balanced and robust performance for AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and Precision@n, at several noise levels and on average over several types of anomalies. These results demonstrate that displacement-based scoring provides a robust alternative to the existing state-of-the-art for unsupervised anomaly detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03293v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LEVIO: Lightweight Embedded Visual Inertial Odometry for Resource-Constrained Devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03294</link><description>arXiv:2602.03294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, infrastructure-less sensor systems for motion tracking are essential for mobile robotics and augmented reality (AR) applications. The most popular state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems, however, are too computationally demanding for resource-constrained hardware, such as micro-drones and smart glasses. This work presents LEVIO, a fully featured VIO pipeline optimized for ultra-low-power compute platforms, allowing six-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) real-time sensing. LEVIO incorporates established VIO components such as Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature tracking and bundle adjustment, while emphasizing a computationally efficient architecture with parallelization and low memory usage to suit embedded microcontrollers and low-power systems-on-chip (SoCs). The paper proposes and details the algorithmic design choices and the hardware-software co-optimization approach, and presents real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware. LEVIO is validated on a parallel-processing ultra-low-power RISC-V SoC, achieving 20 FPS while consuming less than 100 mW, and benchmarked against public VIO datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility and adoption, the complete implementation is released as open-source.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03294v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] POP: Prefill-Only Pruning for Efficient Large Model Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03295</link><description>arXiv:2602.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, their deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. Existing structured pruning methods, while hardware-efficient, often suffer from significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we argue that this failure stems from a stage-agnostic pruning approach that overlooks the asymmetric roles between the prefill and decode stages. By introducing a virtual gate mechanism, our importance analysis reveals that deep layers are critical for next-token prediction (decode) but largely redundant for context encoding (prefill). Leveraging this insight, we propose Prefill-Only Pruning (POP), a stage-aware inference strategy that safely omits deep layers during the computationally intensive prefill stage while retaining the full model for the sensitive decode stage. To enable the transition between stages, we introduce independent Key-Value (KV) projections to maintain cache integrity, and a boundary handling strategy to ensure the accuracy of the first generated token. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1, Qwen3-VL, and Gemma-3 across diverse modalities demonstrate that POP achieves up to 1.37$\times$ speedup in prefill latency with minimal performance loss, effectively overcoming the accuracy-efficiency trade-off limitations of existing structured pruning methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lipschitz Multiscale Deep Equilibrium Models: A Theoretically Guaranteed and Accelerated Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03297</link><description>arXiv:2602.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) achieve infinitely deep network representations without stacking layers by exploring fixed points of layer transformations in neural networks. Such models constitute an innovative approach that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in many large-scale numerical experiments, despite requiring significantly less memory. However, DEQs face the challenge of requiring vastly more computational time for training and inference than conventional methods, as they repeatedly perform fixed-point iterations with no convergence guarantee upon each input. Therefore, this study explored an approach to improve fixed-point convergence and consequently reduce computational time by restructuring the model architecture to guarantee fixed-point convergence. Our proposed approach for image classification, Lipschitz multiscale DEQ, has theoretically guaranteed fixed-point convergence for both forward and backward passes by hyperparameter adjustment, achieving up to a 4.75$\times$ speed-up in numerical experiments on CIFAR-10 at the cost of a minor drop in accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03297v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] R1-SyntheticVL: Is Synthetic Data from Generative Models Ready for Multimodal Large Language Model?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03300</link><description>arXiv:2602.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop effective data synthesis techniques that autonomously synthesize multimodal training data for enhancing MLLMs in solving complex real-world tasks. To this end, we propose Collective Adversarial Data Synthesis (CADS), a novel and general approach to synthesize high-quality, diverse and challenging multimodal data for MLLMs. The core idea of CADS is to leverage collective intelligence to ensure high-quality and diverse generation, while exploring adversarial learning to synthesize challenging samples for effectively driving model improvement. Specifically, CADS operates with two cyclic phases, i.e., Collective Adversarial Data Generation (CAD-Generate) and Collective Adversarial Data Judgment (CAD-Judge). CAD-Generate leverages collective knowledge to jointly generate new and diverse multimodal data, while CAD-Judge collaboratively assesses the quality of synthesized data. In addition, CADS introduces an Adversarial Context Optimization mechanism to optimize the generation context to encourage challenging and high-value data generation. With CADS, we construct MMSynthetic-20K and train our model R1-SyntheticVL, which demonstrates superior performance on various benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03300v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Periodic Regularized Q-Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03301</link><description>arXiv:2602.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), Q-learning is a fundamental algorithm whose convergence is guaranteed in the tabular setting. However, this convergence guarantee does not hold under linear function approximation. To overcome this limitation, a significant line of research has introduced regularization techniques to ensure stable convergence under function approximation. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, periodic regularized Q-learning (PRQ). We first introduce regularization at the level of the projection operator and explicitly construct a regularized projected value iteration (RP-VI), subsequently extending it to a sample-based RL algorithm. By appropriately regularizing the projection operator, the resulting projected value iteration becomes a contraction. By extending this regularized projection into the stochastic setting, we establish the PRQ algorithm and provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that proves finite-time convergence guarantees for PRQ under linear function approximation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03301v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Full end-to-end diagnostic workflow automation of 3D OCT via foundation model-driven AI for retinal diseases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03302</link><description>arXiv:2602.03302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionized retinal disease diagnosis with its high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging nature, yet its full diagnostic automation in clinical practices remains constrained by multi-stage workflows and conventional single-slice single-task AI models. We present Full-process OCT-based Clinical Utility System (FOCUS), a foundation model-driven framework enabling end-to-end automation of 3D OCT retinal disease diagnosis. FOCUS sequentially performs image quality assessment with EfficientNetV2-S, followed by abnormality detection and multi-disease classification using a fine-tuned Vision Foundation Model. Crucially, FOCUS leverages a unified adaptive aggregation method to intelligently integrate 2D slices-level predictions into comprehensive 3D patient-level diagnosis. Trained and tested on 3,300 patients (40,672 slices), and externally validated on 1,345 patients (18,498 slices) across four different-tier centers and diverse OCT devices, FOCUS achieved high F1 scores for quality assessment (99.01%), abnormally detection (97.46%), and patient-level diagnosis (94.39%). Real-world validation across centers also showed stable performance (F1: 90.22%-95.24%). In human-machine comparisons, FOCUS matched expert performance in abnormality detection (F1: 95.47% vs 90.91%) and multi-disease diagnosis (F1: 93.49% vs 91.35%), while demonstrating better efficiency. FOCUS automates the image-to-diagnosis pipeline, representing a critical advance towards unmanned ophthalmology with a validated blueprint for autonomous screening to enhance population scale retinal care accessibility and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03302v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] To Search or Not to Search: Aligning the Decision Boundary of Deep Search Agents via Causal Intervention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03304</link><description>arXiv:2602.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep search agents, which autonomously iterate through multi-turn web-based reasoning, represent a promising paradigm for complex information-seeking tasks. However, current agents suffer from critical inefficiency: they conduct excessive searches as they cannot accurately judge when to stop searching and start answering. This stems from outcome-centric training that prioritize final results over the search process itself. We identify the root cause as misaligned decision boundaries, the threshold determining when accumulated information suffices to answer. This causes over-search (redundant searching despite sufficient knowledge) and under-search (premature termination yielding incorrect answers). To address these errors, we propose a comprehensive framework comprising two key components. First, we introduce causal intervention-based diagnosis that identifies boundary errors by comparing factual and counterfactual trajectories at each decision point. Second, we develop Decision Boundary Alignment for Deep Search agents (DAS), which constructs preference datasets from causal feedback and aligns policies via preference optimization. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that decision boundary errors are pervasive across state-of-the-art agents. Our DAS method effectively calibrates these boundaries, mitigating both over-search and under-search to achieve substantial gains in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful framework for optimizing dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs). However, clinical RL is fundamentally bottlenecked by reward engineering: the challenge of defining signals that safely and effectively guide policy learning in complex, sparse offline environments. Existing approaches often rely on manual heuristics that fail to generalize across diverse pathologies. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for offline reward design and verification. We formulate the reward function using potential functions consisted of three core components: survival, confidence, and competence. We further introduce quantitative metrics to rigorously evaluate and select the optimal reward structure prior to deployment. By integrating LLM-driven domain knowledge, our framework automates the design of reward functions for specific diseases while significantly enhancing the performance of the resulting policies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03305v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Select: Query-Aware Adaptive Dimension Selection for Dense Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03306</link><description>arXiv:2602.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense retrieval represents queries and docu-002 ments as high-dimensional embeddings, but003 these representations can be redundant at the004 query level: for a given information need, only005 a subset of dimensions is consistently help-006 ful for ranking. Prior work addresses this via007 pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) based dimen-008 sion importance estimation, which can produce009 query-aware masks without labeled data but010 often relies on noisy pseudo signals and heuris-011 tic test-time procedures. In contrast, super-012 vised adapter methods leverage relevance labels013 to improve embedding quality, yet they learn014 global transformations shared across queries015 and do not explicitly model query-aware di-016 mension importance.

Abstract: Audio foundation models learn general-purpose audio representations that facilitate a wide range of downstream tasks. While the performance of these models has greatly increased for conventional single-channel, dry audio clips, their success in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise is limited. Furthermore, most audio foundation models ignore the spatial dimension of real-world acoustic environments, ruling out tasks involving sound localization. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a general-purpose real-world audio model that employs a multi-channel masked autoencoder to efficiently learn spatial audio representations. We evaluated GRAM and other audio foundation models in a standardized manner on high-quality simulations of naturalistic, spatial acoustic environments as well as recordings of real-world environments and release these two complementary benchmark task suites: NatHEAR and RealSELD. Our results demonstrate that GRAM outperforms all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models on NatHEAR and the clean, single-channel version HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also shows state-of-the-art localization performance in simulated environments and generalizes efficiently to real-world recordings in RealSELD. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advance toward robust spatial audio foundation models for real-world environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03307v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Entropy-Gated Selective Policy Optimization:Token-Level Gradient Allocation for Hybrid Training of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03309</link><description>arXiv:2602.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid training methods for large language models combine supervised fine tuning (SFT) on expert demonstrations with reinforcement learning (RL) on model rollouts, typically at the sample level. We propose Entropy Gated Selective Policy Optimization (EGSPO), a three stage framework that extends sample level mixing with token level gradient modulation.
  Stage 1, SFT expert learning, establishes a reliable warm up policy using expert demonstrations with a pure SFT loss. Stage 2, RL rollout generation, samples trajectories from the current policy and computes per token predictive entropy. Stage 3, the EGSPO mechanism, applies entropy gated gradient allocation: a predictive entropy module routes high entropy tokens to full PPO updates to encourage exploration, and low entropy tokens to attenuated PPO updates to reduce variance and preserve knowledge. Critically, both branches incorporate the advantage function A_t, ensuring that incorrect trajectories receive consistent negative learning signals and preventing reinforcement of confident errors.
  EGSPO achieves consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with gains of 3.8 percent on AIME and 2.9 percent on MATH over the CHORD phi baseline, while incurring only 3.4 percent additional computational overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03309v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RDT2: Exploring the Scaling Limit of UMI Data Towards Zero-Shot Cross-Embodiment Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03310</link><description>arXiv:2602.03310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold promise for generalist robotics but currently struggle with data scarcity, architectural inefficiencies, and the inability to generalize across different hardware platforms. We introduce RDT2, a robotic foundation model built upon a 7B parameter VLM designed to enable zero-shot deployment on novel embodiments for open-vocabulary tasks. To achieve this, we collected one of the largest open-source robotic datasets--over 10,000 hours of demonstrations in diverse families--using an enhanced, embodiment-agnostic Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI). Our approach employs a novel three-stage training recipe that aligns discrete linguistic knowledge with continuous control via Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), flow-matching, and distillation for real-time inference. Consequently, RDT2 becomes one of the first models that simultaneously zero-shot generalizes to unseen objects, scenes, instructions, and even robotic platforms. Besides, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in dexterous, long-horizon, and dynamic downstream tasks like playing table tennis.

Abstract: Defect depth quantification in additively manufactured (AM) components remains a significant challenge for non-destructive testing (NDT).

The PQT-Net architecture incorporates a pre-trained EfficientNetV2-S backbone and a custom Residual Regression Head (RRH) with learnable parameters to refine outputs. Comparative experiments demonstrate the superiority of PQT-Net over other deep learning models, achieving a minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0094 mm and a coefficient of determination (R) exceeding 99%.

Memora organizes information via its primary abstractions that index concrete memory values and consolidate related updates into unified memory entries, while cue anchors expand retrieval access across diverse aspects of the memory and connect related memories. Building on this structure, we employ a retrieval policy that actively exploits these memory connections to retrieve relevant information beyond direct semantic similarity. Theoretically, we show that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graph (KG)-based memory systems emerge as special cases of our framework. Empirically, Memora establishes a new state-of-the-art on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks, demonstrating better retrieval relevance and reasoning effectiveness as memory scales.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03315v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Invisible Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks for Generative Data Augmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03316</link><description>arXiv:2602.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generative models, generative data augmentation has become an effective way to enrich training images, especially when only small-scale datasets are available. At the same time, in practical applications, generative data augmentation can be vulnerable to clean-label backdoor attacks, which aim to bypass human inspection. However, based on theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments, we observe that directly applying existing pixel-level clean-label backdoor attack methods (e.g., COMBAT) to generated images results in low attack success rates. This motivates us to move beyond pixel-level triggers and focus instead on the latent feature level. To this end, we propose InvLBA, an invisible clean-label backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation by latent perturbation. We theoretically prove that the generalization of the clean accuracy and attack success rates of InvLBA can be guaranteed. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our method improves the attack success rate by 46.43% on average, with almost no reduction in clean accuracy and high robustness against SOTA defense methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03316v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MIRROR: A Multi-Agent Framework with Iterative Adaptive Revision and Hierarchical Retrieval for Optimization Modeling in Operations Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03318</link><description>arXiv:2602.03318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operations Research (OR) relies on expert-driven modeling-a slow and fragile process ill-suited to novel scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) can automatically translate natural language into optimization models, existing approaches either rely on costly post-training or employ multi-agent frameworks, yet most still lack reliable collaborative error correction and task-specific retrieval, often leading to incorrect outputs. We propose MIRROR, a fine-tuning-free, end-to-end multi-agent framework that directly translates natural language optimization problems into mathematical models and solver code. MIRROR integrates two core mechanisms: (1) execution-driven iterative adaptive revision for automatic error correction, and (2) hierarchical retrieval to fetch relevant modeling and coding exemplars from a carefully curated exemplar library. Experiments show that MIRROR outperforms existing methods on standard OR benchmarks, with notable results on complex industrial datasets such as IndustryOR and Mamo-ComplexLP. By combining precise external knowledge infusion with systematic error correction, MIRROR provides non-expert users with an efficient and reliable OR modeling solution, overcoming the fundamental limitations of general-purpose LLMs in expert optimization tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03318v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Information-Theoretic Multi-Model Fusion for Target-Oriented Adaptive Sampling in Materials Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03319</link><description>arXiv:2602.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target-oriented discovery under limited evaluation budgets requires making reliable progress in high-dimensional, heterogeneous design spaces where each new measurement is costly, whether experimental or high-fidelity simulation. We present an information-theoretic framework for target-oriented adaptive sampling that reframes optimization as trajectory discovery: instead of approximating the full response surface, the method maintains and refines a low-entropy information state that concentrates search on target-relevant directions. The approach couples data, model beliefs, and physics/structure priors through dimension-aware information budgeting, adaptive bootstrapped distillation over a heterogeneous surrogate reservoir, and structure-aware candidate manifold analysis with Kalman-inspired multi-model fusion to balance consensus-driven exploitation and disagreement-driven exploration. Evaluated under a single unified protocol without dataset-specific tuning, the framework improves sample efficiency and reliability across 14 single- and multi-objective materials design tasks spanning candidate pools from $600$ to $4 \times 10^6$ and feature dimensions from $10$ to $10^3$, typically reaching top-performing regions within 100 evaluations. Complementary 20-dimensional synthetic benchmarks (Ackley, Rastrigin, Schwefel) further demonstrate robustness to rugged and multimodal landscapes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03319v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MedSAM-Agent: Empowering Interactive Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-turn Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03320</link><description>arXiv:2602.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is evolving from task-specific models toward generalizable frameworks. Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization.

Abstract: Route recommendation systems commonly adopt a multi-stage pipeline involving fine-ranking and re-ranking to produce high-quality ordered recommendations. However, this paradigm faces three critical limitations. First, there is a misalignment between offline training objectives and online metrics. Offline gains do not necessarily translate to online improvements. Actual performance must be validated through A/B testing, which may potentially compromise the user experience. Second, redundancy elimination relies on rigid, handcrafted rules that lack adaptability to the high variance in user intent and the unstructured complexity of real-world scenarios. Third, the strict separation between fine-ranking and re-ranking stages leads to sub-optimal performance. Since each module is optimized in isolation, the fine-ranking stage remains oblivious to the list-level objectives (e.g., diversity) targeted by the re-ranker, thereby preventing the system from achieving a jointly optimized global optimum. To overcome these intertwined challenges, we propose \textbf{SCASRec} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{C}orrecting and \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{S}topping \textbf{Rec}ommendation), a unified generative framework that integrates ranking and redundancy elimination into a single end-to-end process. SCASRec introduces a stepwise corrective reward (SCR) to guide list-wise refinement by focusing on hard samples, and employs a learnable End-of-Recommendation (EOR) token to terminate generation adaptively when no further improvement is expected. Experiments on two large-scale, open-sourced route recommendation datasets demonstrate that SCASRec establishes an SOTA in offline and online settings. SCASRec has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pi-GS: Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting with Dense {\pi}^3 Initialization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03327</link><description>arXiv:2602.03327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis has evolved rapidly, advancing from Neural Radiance Fields to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which offers real-time rendering and rapid training without compromising visual fidelity. However, 3DGS relies heavily on accurate camera poses and high-quality point cloud initialization, which are difficult to obtain in sparse-view scenarios. While traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) pipelines often fail in these settings, existing learning-based point estimation alternatives typically require reliable reference views and remain sensitive to pose or depth errors. In this work, we propose a robust method utilizing {\pi}^3, a reference-free point cloud estimation network. We integrate dense initialization from {\pi}^3 with a regularization scheme designed to mitigate geometric inaccuracies. Specifically, we employ uncertainty-guided depth supervision, normal consistency loss, and depth warping. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Tanks and Temples, LLFF, DTU, and MipNeRF360 datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03327v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GuardReasoner-Omni: A Reasoning-based Multi-modal Guardrail for Text, Image, and Video</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03328</link><description>arXiv:2602.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GuardReasoner-Omni, a reasoning-based guardrail model designed to moderate text, image, and video data. First, we construct a comprehensive training corpus comprising 148k samples spanning these three modalities. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage paradigm to incentivize the model to deliberate before making decisions: (1) conducting SFT to cold-start the model with explicit reasoning capabilities and structural adherence; and (2) performing RL, incorporating an error-driven exploration reward to incentivize deeper reasoning on hard samples. We release a suite of models scaled at 2B and 4B parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GuardReasoner-Omni achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines across various guardrail benchmarks. Notably, GuardReasoner-Omni (2B) significantly surpasses the runner-up by 5.3% F1 score.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03328v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Inexact Gradients to Byzantine Robustness: Acceleration and Optimization under Similarity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03329</link><description>arXiv:2602.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard federated learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial nodes, a.k.a. Byzantine failures. To solve this issue, robust distributed learning algorithms have been developed, which typically replace parameter averaging by robust aggregations. While generic conditions on these aggregations exist to guarantee the convergence of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent (SGD), the analyses remain rather ad-hoc. This hinders the development of more complex robust algorithms, such as accelerated ones. In this work, we show that Byzantine-robust distributed optimization can, under standard generic assumptions, be cast as a general optimization with inexact gradient oracles (with both additive and multiplicative error terms), an active field of research.
  This allows for instance to directly show that GD on top of standard robust aggregation procedures obtains optimal asymptotic error in the Byzantine setting. Going further, we propose two optimization schemes to speed up the convergence. The first one is a Nesterov-type accelerated scheme whose proof directly derives from accelerated inexact gradient results applied to our formulation. The second one hinges on Optimization under Similarity, in which the server leverages an auxiliary loss function that approximates the global loss. Both approaches allow to drastically reduce the communication complexity compared to previous methods, as we show theoretically and empirically.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03329v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Conformal Prediction as a Decision Risk Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03331</link><description>arXiv:2602.03331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian posterior predictive densities as non-conformity scores and Bayesian quadrature are used to estimate and minimise the expected prediction set size. Operating within a split conformal framework, BCP provides valid coverage guarantees and demonstrates reliable empirical coverage under model misspecification. Across regression and classification tasks, including distribution-shifted settings such as ImageNet-A, BCP yields prediction sets of comparable size to split conformal prediction, while exhibiting substantially lower run-to-run variability in set size. In sparse regression with nominal coverage of 80 percent, BCP achieves 81 percent empirical coverage under a misspecified prior, whereas Bayesian credible intervals under-cover at 49 percent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03331v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PWAVEP: Purifying Imperceptible Adversarial Perturbations in 3D Point Clouds via Spectral Graph Wavelets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03333</link><description>arXiv:2602.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds, particularly in achieving spatial imperceptibility and high attack performance, presents significant challenges for defenders. Current defensive approaches remain cumbersome, often requiring invasive model modifications, expensive training procedures or auxiliary data access. To address these threats, in this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and non-invasive defense mechanism in the spectral domain, grounded in a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between imperceptible perturbations and high-frequency spectral components. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel purification framework, termed PWAVEP, which begins by computing a spectral graph wavelet domain saliency score and local sparsity score for each point. Guided by these values, PWAVEP adopts a hierarchical strategy, it eliminates the most salient points, which are identified as hardly recoverable adversarial outliers. Simultaneously, it applies a spectral filtering process to a broader set of moderately salient points. This process leverages a graph wavelet transform to attenuate high-frequency coefficients associated with the targeted points, thereby effectively suppressing adversarial noise. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PWAVEP achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud purification.

Abstract: This paper examines biases in large language models (LLMs) when generating synthetic populations from responses to personality questionnaires. Using five LLMs, we first assess the representativeness and potential biases in the sociodemographic attributes of the generated personas, as well as their alignment with the intended personality traits. While LLMs successfully reproduce known correlations between personality and sociodemographic variables, all models exhibit pronounced WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic) biases, favoring young, educated, white, heterosexual, Western individuals with centrist or progressive political views and secular or Christian beliefs. In a second analysis, we manipulate input traits to maximize Neuroticism and Psychoticism scores. Notably, when Psychoticism is maximized, several models produce an overrepresentation of non-binary and LGBTQ+ identities, raising concerns about stereotyping and the potential pathologization of marginalized groups. Our findings highlight both the potential and the risks of using LLMs to generate psychologically grounded synthetic populations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vigemers: on the number of $k$-mers sharing the same XOR-based minimizer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03337</link><description>arXiv:2602.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bioinformatics, minimizers have become an inescapable method for handling $k$-mers (words of fixed size $k$) extracted from DNA or RNA sequencing, whether for sampling, storage, querying or partitioning. According to some fixed order on $m$-mers ($m&lt;k$), the minimizer of a $k$-mer is defined as its smallest $m$-mer -- and acts as its fingerprint. Although minimizers are widely used for partitioning purposes, there is almost no theoretical work on the quality of the resulting partitions. For instance, it has been known for decades that the lexicographic order empirically leads to highly unbalanced partitions that are unusable in practice, but it was not until very recently that this observation was theoretically substantiated. The rejection of the lexicographic order has led the community to resort to (pseudo-)random orders using hash functions. In this work, we extend the theoretical results relating to the partitions obtained by the lexicographical order, departing from it to a (exponentially) large family of hash functions, namely where the $m$-mers are XORed against a fixed key. More precisely, provided a key $\gamma$ and a $m$-mer $w$, we investigate the function that counts how many $k$-mers admit $w$ as their minimizer (i.e. where $w\oplus\gamma$ is minimal among all $m$-mers of said $k$-mers). This number, denoted by $\pi_k^{\gamma}(w)$, represents the maximum size of the bucket associated with $w$, if all possible $k$-mers were to be seen and partitioned. We adapt the (lexicographical order) method of the literature to our framework and propose combinatorial equations that allow to compute, using dynamic programming, $\pi_k^{\gamma}(w)$ in $O(km^2)$ time and $O(km)$ space.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03337v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accurate Failure Prediction in Agents Does Not Imply Effective Failure Prevention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03338</link><description>arXiv:2602.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proactive interventions by LLM critic models are often assumed to improve reliability, yet their effects at deployment time are poorly understood. We show that a binary LLM critic with strong offline accuracy (AUROC 0.94) can nevertheless cause severe performance degradation, inducing a 26 percentage point (pp) collapse on one model while affecting another by near zero pp. This variability demonstrates that LLM critic accuracy alone is insufficient to determine whether intervention is safe.
  We identify a disruption-recovery tradeoff: interventions may recover failing trajectories but also disrupt trajectories that would have succeeded. Based on this insight, we propose a pre-deployment test that uses a small pilot of 50 tasks to estimate whether intervention is likely to help or harm, without requiring full deployment. Across benchmarks, the test correctly anticipates outcomes: intervention degrades performance on high-success tasks (0 to -26 pp), while yielding a modest improvement on the high-failure ALFWorld benchmark (+2.8 pp, p=0.014). The primary value of our framework is therefore identifying when not to intervene, preventing severe regressions before deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03338v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Composable Visual Tokenizers with Generator-Free Diagnostics of Learnability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03339</link><description>arXiv:2602.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CompTok, a training framework for learning visual tokenizers whose tokens are enhanced for compositionality. CompTok uses a token-conditioned diffusion decoder. By employing an InfoGAN-style objective, where we train a recognition model to predict the tokens used to condition the diffusion decoder using the decoded images, we enforce the decoder to not ignore any of the tokens. To promote compositional control, besides the original images, CompTok also trains on tokens formed by swapping token subsets between images, enabling more compositional control of the token over the decoder. As the swapped tokens between images do not have ground truth image targets, we apply a manifold constraint via an adversarial flow regularizer to keep unpaired swap generations on the natural-image distribution. The resulting tokenizer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on image class-conditioned generation, but also demonstrates properties such as swapping tokens between images to achieve high level semantic editing of an image. Additionally, we propose two metrics that measures the landscape of the token space that can be useful to describe not only the compositionality of the tokens, but also how easy to learn the landscape is for a generator to be trained on this space. We show in experiments that CompTok can improve on both of the metrics as well as supporting state-of-the-art generators for class conditioned generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03339v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MentalSeek-Dx: Towards Progressive Hypothetico-Deductive Reasoning for Real-world Psychiatric Diagnosis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03340</link><description>arXiv:2602.03340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental health disorders represent a burgeoning global public health challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in psychiatric assessment, their clinical utility is severely constrained by benchmarks that lack ecological validity and fine-grained diagnostic supervision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MentalDx Bench}, the first benchmark dedicated to disorder-level psychiatric diagnosis within real-world clinical settings. Comprising 712 de-identified electronic health records annotated by board-certified psychiatrists under ICD-11 guidelines, the benchmark covers 76 disorders across 16 diagnostic categories. Evaluation of 18 LLMs reveals a critical \textit{paradigm misalignment}: strong performance at coarse diagnostic categorization contrasts with systematic failure at disorder-level diagnosis, underscoring a gap between pattern-based modeling and clinical hypothetico-deductive reasoning. In response, we propose \textbf{MentalSeek-Dx}, a medical-specialized LLM trained to internalize this clinical reasoning process through supervised trajectory construction and curriculum-based reinforcement learning. Experiments on MentalDx Bench demonstrate that MentalSeek-Dx achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with only 14B parameters, establishing a clinically grounded framework for reliable psychiatric diagnosis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03340v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tiled Prompts: Overcoming Prompt Underspecification in Image and Video Super-Resolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03342</link><description>arXiv:2602.03342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-conditioned diffusion models have advanced image and video super-resolution by using prompts as semantic priors, but modern super-resolution pipelines typically rely on latent tiling to scale to high resolutions, where a single global caption causes prompt underspecification. A coarse global prompt often misses localized details (prompt sparsity) and provides locally irrelevant guidance (prompt misguidance) that can be amplified by classifier-free guidance. We propose Tiled Prompts, a unified framework for image and video super-resolution that generates a tile-specific prompt for each latent tile and performs super-resolution under locally text-conditioned posteriors, providing high-information guidance that resolves prompt underspecification with minimal overhead. Experiments on high resolution real-world images and videos show consistent gains in perceptual quality and text alignment, while reducing hallucinations and tile-level artifacts relative to global-prompt baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03342v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robustness as an Emergent Property of Task Performance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03344</link><description>arXiv:2602.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness is often regarded as a critical future challenge for real-world applications, where stability is essential. However, as models often learn tasks in a similar order, we hypothesize that easier tasks will be easier regardless of how they are presented to the model. Indeed, in this paper, we show that as models approach high performance on a task, robustness is effectively achieved. Through an empirical analysis of multiple models across diverse datasets and configurations (e.g., paraphrases, different temperatures), we find a strong positive correlation. Moreover, we find that robustness is primarily driven by task-specific competence rather than inherent model-level properties, challenging current approaches that treat robustness as an independent capability. Thus, from a high-level perspective, we may expect that as new tasks saturate, model robustness on these tasks will emerge accordingly. For researchers, this implies that explicit efforts to measure and improve robustness may warrant reduced emphasis, as such robustness is likely to develop alongside performance gains. For practitioners, it acts as a sign that indeed the tasks that the literature deals with are unreliable, but on easier past tasks, the models are reliable and ready for real-world deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03344v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamics of Implicit Time-Invariant Max-Min-Plus-Scaling Discrete-Event Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03346</link><description>arXiv:2602.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Max-min-plus-scaling (MMPS) systems generalize max-plus, min-plus and max-min-plus models with more flexibility in modelling discrete-event dynamics. Especially, implicit MMPS models capture a wide range of real world discrete-event applications. This article analyzes the dynamics of an autonomous, time-invariant implicit MMPS system in a discrete-event framework. First, we provide sufficient conditions under which an implicit MMPS system admits at least one solution to its state-space representation. Then, we analyze its global behavior by determining the key parameters; the growth rates and fixed points. For a solvable MMPS system, we assess the local behavior of the system around its set of fixed points via a normalization procedure. Further, we present the notion of stability for the normalized system. A case study of the urban railway network substantiates the theoretical results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Manipulation via Force Distribution at Contact</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03350</link><description>arXiv:2602.03350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and robust trajectories play a crucial role in contact-rich manipulation, which demands accurate mod- eling of object-robot interactions. Many existing approaches rely on point contact models due to their computational effi- ciency. Simple contact models are computationally efficient but inherently limited for achieving human-like, contact-rich ma- nipulation, as they fail to capture key frictional dynamics and torque generation observed in human manipulation. This study introduces a Force-Distributed Line Contact (FDLC) model in contact-rich manipulation and compares it against conventional point contact models. A bi-level optimization framework is constructed, in which the lower-level solves an optimization problem for contact force computation, and the upper-level optimization applies iLQR for trajectory optimization. Through this framework, the limitations of point contact are demon- strated, and the benefits of the FDLC in generating efficient and robust trajectories are established. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by a box rotating task, demonstrating that FDLC enables trajectories generated via non-uniform force distributions along the contact line, while requiring lower control effort and less motion of the robot.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03350v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Building Interpretable Models for Moral Decision-Making</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03351</link><description>arXiv:2602.03351v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong promise for LLM-based machine translation, with recent methods such as GRPO demonstrating notable gains; nevertheless, translation-oriented RL remains challenged by noisy learning signals arising from Monte Carlo return estimation, as well as a large trajectory space that favors global exploration over fine-grained local optimization. We introduce \textbf{PEGRL}, a \textit{two-stage} RL framework that uses post-editing as an auxiliary task to stabilize training and guide overall optimization. At each iteration, translation outputs are sampled to construct post-editing inputs, allowing return estimation in the post-editing stage to benefit from conditioning on the current translation behavior, while jointly supporting both global exploration and fine-grained local optimization. A task-specific weighting scheme further balances the contributions of translation and post-editing objectives, yielding a biased yet more sample-efficient estimator. Experiments on English$\to$Finnish, English$\to$Turkish, and English$\leftrightarrow$Chinese show consistent gains over RL baselines, and for English$\to$Turkish, performance on COMET-KIWI is comparable to advanced LLM-based systems (DeepSeek-V3.2).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Graph Learning via Distributional Invariance of Cause-Effect Relationship</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03353</link><description>arXiv:2602.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for recovering causal graphs from observational data, leveraging the observation that the distribution of an effect, conditioned on its causes, remains invariant to changes in the prior distribution of those causes. This insight enables a direct test for potential causal relationships by checking the variance of their corresponding effect-cause conditional distributions across multiple downsampled subsets of the data. These subsets are selected to reflect different prior cause distributions, while preserving the effect-cause conditional relationships. Using this invariance test and exploiting an (empirical) sparsity of most causal graphs, we develop an algorithm that efficiently uncovers causal relationships with quadratic complexity in the number of observational variables, reducing the processing time by up to 25x compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our empirical experiments on a varied benchmark of large-scale datasets show superior or equivalent performance compared to existing works, while achieving enhanced scalability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03353v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QASM: A Novel Framework for QUIC-Aware Stateful Middleboxes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03354</link><description>arXiv:2602.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stateful Middleboxes are integral part of enterprise and campus networks that provide essential in-network, security, and value-added services. These stateful middleboxes rely on precise network flow identification. However, the adoption of HTTP/3, which uses the QUIC protocol, poses significant challenges to the proper functioning of these devices. QUIC's encryption and connection migration features obscure flow semantics, disrupting middlebox visibility and functionality. We examine how QUIC disrupts middleboxes like Network Address Translators (NATs), Rate Limiters, Load Balancers, etc., and affects Kubernetes-based service deployments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, generalized framework that enables stateful middleboxes to reliably track QUIC connections, even when the endpoints change their internet protocol (IP) address or port numbers. Our prototype implementation demonstrates that the proposed approach preserves middlebox functionality with HTTP/3 with negligible performance overhead (&lt; 5%) on both throughput and latency, and works effectively even under high QUIC connection migration rates of up to 100 Hz.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03354v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PACE: Pretrained Audio Continual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03355</link><description>arXiv:2602.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio is a fundamental modality for analyzing speech, music, and environmental sounds. Although pretrained audio models have significantly advanced audio understanding, they remain fragile in real-world settings where data distributions shift over time. In this work, we present the first systematic benchmark for audio continual learning (CL) with pretrained models (PTMs), together with a comprehensive analysis of its unique challenges. Unlike in vision, where parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has proven effective for CL, directly transferring such strategies to audio leads to poor performance. This stems from a fundamental property of audio backbones: they focus on low-level spectral details rather than structured semantics, causing severe upstream-downstream misalignment. Through extensive empirical study, we identify analytic classifiers with first-session adaptation (FSA) as a promising direction, but also reveal two major limitations: representation saturation in coarse-grained scenarios and representation drift in fine-grained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PACE, a novel method that enhances FSA via a regularized analytic classifier and enables multi-session adaptation through adaptive subspace-orthogonal PEFT for improved semantic alignment. In addition, we introduce spectrogram-based boundary-aware perturbations to mitigate representation overlap and improve stability. Experiments on six diverse audio CL benchmarks demonstrate that PACE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking an important step toward robust and scalable audio continual learning with PTMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03355v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Achieving Linear Speedup for Composite Federated Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03357</link><description>arXiv:2602.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes FedNMap, a normal map-based method for composite federated learning, where the objective consists of a smooth loss and a possibly nonsmooth regularizer. FedNMap leverages a normal map-based update scheme to handle the nonsmooth term and incorporates a local correction strategy to mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity across clients. Under standard assumptions, including smooth local losses, weak convexity of the regularizer, and bounded stochastic gradient variance, FedNMap achieves linear speedup with respect to both the number of clients $n$ and the number of local updates $Q$ for nonconvex losses, both with and without the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing linear speedup for nonconvex composite federated learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03357v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GFlowPO: Generative Flow Network as a Language Model Prompt Optimizer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03358</link><description>arXiv:2602.03358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding effective prompts for language models (LMs) is critical yet notoriously difficult: the prompt space is combinatorially large, rewards are sparse due to expensive target-LM evaluation. Yet, existing RL-based prompt optimizers often rely on on-policy updates and a meta-prompt sampled from a fixed distribution, leading to poor sample efficiency. We propose GFlowPO, a probabilistic prompt optimization framework that casts prompt search as a posterior inference problem over latent prompts regularized by a meta-prompted reference-LM prior. In the first step, we fine-tune a lightweight prompt-LM with an off-policy Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) objective, using a replay-based training policy that reuses past prompt evaluations to enable sample-efficient exploration. In the second step, we introduce Dynamic Memory Update (DMU), a training-free mechanism that updates the meta-prompt by injecting both (i) diverse prompts from a replay buffer and (ii) top-performing prompts from a small priority queue, thereby progressively concentrating the search process on high-reward regions. Across few-shot text classification, instruction induction benchmarks, and question answering tasks, GFlowPO consistently outperforms recent discrete prompt optimization baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03358v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MeKi: Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection for Efficient LLM Scaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03359</link><description>arXiv:2602.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) typically relies on increasing the number of parameters or test-time computations to boost performance. However, these strategies are impractical for edge device deployment due to limited RAM and NPU resources. Despite hardware constraints, deploying performant LLM on edge devices such as smartphone remains crucial for user experience. To address this, we propose MeKi (Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection), a novel system that scales LLM capacity via storage space rather than FLOPs. MeKi equips each Transformer layer with token-level memory experts that injects pre-stored semantic knowledge into the generation process. To bridge the gap between training capacity and inference efficiency, we employ a re-parameterization strategy to fold parameter matrices used during training into a compact static lookup table. By offloading the knowledge to ROM, MeKi decouples model capacity from computational cost, introducing zero inference latency overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeKi significantly outperforms dense LLM baselines with identical inference speed, validating the effectiveness of memory-based scaling paradigm for on-device LLMs. Project homepage is at https://github.com/ningding-o/MeKi.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Z3D: Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding from Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03361</link><description>arXiv:2602.03361v1 Announce Type: new

For a systematic training scheme across various platform motions, we introduce platform trajectory generation and scheduling methods. Our evaluation demonstrates superior balancing performance across multiple metrics compared to three baselines. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of the \textit{LAS-MP}, including ablation studies and evaluation of the estimators, to validate the effectiveness of each component.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03367v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pursuing Best Industrial Practices for Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the Medical Domain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03368</link><description>arXiv:2602.03368v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) requires reasoning over diverse symbols and 2D structural layouts, yet autoregressive models struggle with exposure bias and syntactic inconsistency. We present a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates HMER as iterative symbolic refinement instead of sequential generation.

A symbol-aware tokenization and Random-Masking Mutual Learning further enhance syntactic alignment and robustness to handwriting diversity. On the MathWriting benchmark, the proposal achieves 5.56\% CER and 60.42\% EM, outperforming strong Transformer and commercial baselines.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) offers a cost-effective solution for assessing the geometric occupancy and semantic labels of each voxel in the surrounding 3D scene with image inputs, providing a voxel-level scene perception foundation for the perception-prediction-planning autonomous driving systems. Although significant progress has been made in existing methods, their optimization rely solely on the supervision from voxel labels and face the challenge of voxel sparsity as a large portion of voxels in autonomous driving scenarios are empty, which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance. To address this issue, we propose a \textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions.

Abstract: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) lesions in epilepsy FLAIR MRI are subtle and scarce, making joint image--mask generative modeling prone to instability and memorization.

As an internal baseline, we include the canonical DDPM-style objective ($\epsilon$-prediction with $L_2$ loss) and isolate the effect of prediction parameterization and $L_p$ geometry under a matched setup. Experiments show that $x_0$-prediction is consistently the strongest choice for joint synthesis, and that fractional sub-quadratic penalties ($L_{1.5}$) improve image fidelity while $L_2$ better preserves lesion mask morphology.

Abstract: Deep watermarking methods often share similar encoder-decoder architectures, yet differ substantially in their functional behaviors. We propose DiM, a new multi-dimensional watermarking framework that formulates watermarking as a dimension-aware mapping problem, thereby unifying existing watermarking methods at the functional level. Under DiM, watermark information is modeled as payloads of different dimensionalities, including one-dimensional binary messages, two-dimensional spatial masks, and three-dimensional spatiotemporal structures. We find that the dimensional configuration of embedding and extraction largely determines the resulting watermarking behavior. Same-dimensional mappings preserve payload structure and support fine-grained control, while cross-dimensional mappings enable spatial or spatiotemporal localization. We instantiate DiM in the video domain, where spatiotemporal representations enable a broader set of dimension mappings. Experiments demonstrate that varying only the embedding and extraction dimensions, without architectural changes, leads to different watermarking capabilities, including spatiotemporal tamper localization, local embedding control, and recovery of temporal order under frame disruptions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03373v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How do people watch AI-generated videos of physical scenes?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03374</link><description>arXiv:2602.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of realistic AI-generated videos on media platforms increasingly blurs the line between fact and fiction, eroding public trust. Understanding how people watch AI-generated videos offers a human-centered perspective for improving AI detection and guiding advancements in video generation. However, existing studies have not investigated human gaze behavior in response to AI-generated videos of physical scenes. Here, we collect and analyze the eye movements from 40 participants during video understanding and AI detection tasks involving a mix of real-world and AI-generated videos. We find that given the high realism of AI-generated videos, gaze behavior is driven less by the video's actual authenticity and more by the viewer's perception of its authenticity. Our results demonstrate that the mere awareness of potential AI generation may alter media consumption from passive viewing into an active search for anomalies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03374v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PlanTRansformer: Unified Prediction and Planning with Goal-conditioned Transformer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03376</link><description>arXiv:2602.03376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning are fundamental yet disconnected components in autonomous driving. Prediction models forecast surrounding agent motion under unknown intentions, producing multimodal distributions, while planning assumes known ego objectives and generates deterministic trajectories. This mismatch creates a critical bottleneck: prediction lacks supervision for agent intentions, while planning requires this information. Existing prediction models, despite strong benchmarking performance, often remain disconnected from planning constraints such as collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility. We introduce Plan TRansformer (PTR), a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework integrating goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. A teacher-student training strategy progressively masks surrounding agent commands during training to align with inference conditions where agent intentions are unavailable. PTR achieves 4.3%/3.5% improvement in marginal/joint mAP compared to the baseline Motion Transformer (MTR) and 15.5% planning error reduction at 5s horizon compared to GameFormer. The architecture-agnostic design enables application to diverse Transformer-based prediction models.

Abstract: To ensure the responsible distribution and use of open-source deep neural networks (DNNs), DNN watermarking has become a crucial technique to trace and verify unauthorized model replication or misuse. In practice, black-box watermarks manifest as specific predictive behaviors for specially crafted samples. However, due to the generalization nature of DNNs, the keys to extracting the watermark message are not unique, which would provide attackers with more opportunities. Advanced attack techniques can reverse-engineer approximate replacements for the original watermark keys, enabling subsequent watermark removal. In this paper, we explore black-box DNN watermarking specificity, which refers to the accuracy of a watermark's response to a key. Using this concept, we introduce Specificity-Enhanced Watermarking (SEW), a new method that improves specificity by reducing the association between the watermark and approximate keys. Through extensive evaluation using three popular watermarking benchmarks, we validate that enhancing specificity significantly contributes to strengthening robustness against removal attacks. SEW effectively defends against six state-of-the-art removal attacks, while maintaining model usability and watermark verification performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03377v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Benign Relearning: Syntax as the Hidden Driver of Unlearning Failures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03379</link><description>arXiv:2602.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific content from trained models while preserving overall performance. However, the phenomenon of benign relearning, in which forgotten information reemerges even from benign fine-tuning data, reveals that existing unlearning methods remain fundamentally fragile. A common explanation attributes this effect to topical relevance, but we find this account insufficient. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that syntactic similarity, rather than topicality, is the primary driver: across benchmarks, syntactically similar data consistently trigger recovery even without topical overlap, due to their alignment in representations and gradients with the forgotten content. Motivated by this insight, we introduce syntactic diversification, which paraphrases the original forget queries into heterogeneous structures prior to unlearning. This approach effectively suppresses benign relearning, accelerates forgetting, and substantially alleviates the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model utility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03379v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Seeing Through the Chain: Mitigate Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning Models via CoT Compression and Contrastive Preference Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03380</link><description>arXiv:2602.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While multimodal reasoning models (MLRMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities, they remain prone to hallucinations, and effective solutions are still underexplored. In this paper, we experimentally analyze the hallucination cause and propose C3PO, a training-based mitigation framework comprising \textbf{C}hain-of-Thought \textbf{C}ompression and \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization. Firstly, we identify that introducing reasoning mechanisms exacerbates models' reliance on language priors while overlooking visual inputs, which can produce CoTs with reduced visual cues but redundant text tokens. To this end, we propose to selectively filter redundant thinking tokens for a more compact and signal-efficient CoT representation that preserves task-relevant information while suppressing noise. In addition, we observe that the quality of the reasoning trace largely determines whether hallucination emerges in subsequent responses. To leverage this insight, we introduce a reasoning-enhanced preference tuning scheme that constructs training pairs using high-quality AI feedback. We further design a multimodal hallucination-inducing mechanism that elicits models' inherent hallucination patterns via carefully crafted inducers, yielding informative negative signals for contrastive correction. We provide theoretical justification for the effectiveness and demonstrate consistent hallucination reduction across diverse MLRMs and benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03380v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Programming for Epistemic Uncertainty in Markov Decision Processes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03381</link><description>arXiv:2602.03381v1 Announce Type: new

This ambiguity-averse MDP framework unifies several models of MDPs with epistemic uncertainty for specific choices of risk measures. We extend the concepts of value functions and Bellman operators to our setting. Based on these objects, we establish the consequences of dynamic programming principles in this framework (existence of stationary policies, value and policy iteration algorithms), and we completely characterize law-invariant risk measures compatible with dynamic programming. Our work draws connections among several variants of MDP models and fully delineates what is possible under the dynamic programming paradigm and which risk measures require leaving it.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03381v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Approximate Ascent Approach To Prove Convergence of PPO</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03386</link><description>arXiv:2602.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is among the most widely used deep reinforcement learning algorithms, yet its theoretical foundations remain incomplete. Most importantly, convergence and understanding of fundamental PPO advantages remain widely open. Under standard theory assumptions we show how PPO's policy update scheme (performing multiple epochs of minibatch updates on multi-use rollouts with a surrogate gradient) can be interpreted as approximated policy gradient ascent. We show how to control the bias accumulated by the surrogate gradients and use techniques from random reshuffling to prove a convergence theorem for PPO that sheds light on PPO's success. Additionally, we identify a previously overlooked issue in truncated Generalized Advantage Estimation commonly used in PPO. The geometric weighting scheme induces infinite mass collapse onto the longest $k$-step advantage estimator at episode boundaries. Empirical evaluations show that a simple weight correction can yield substantial improvements in environments with strong terminal signal, such as Lunar Lander.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03386v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward a Sustainable Federated Learning Ecosystem: A Practical Least Core Mechanism for Payoff Allocation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03387</link><description>arXiv:2602.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging network paradigms and applications increasingly rely on federated learning (FL) to enable collaborative intelligence while preserving privacy. However, the sustainability of such collaborative environments hinges on a fair and stable payoff allocation mechanism. Focusing on coalition stability, this paper introduces a payoff allocation framework based on the least core (LC) concept. Unlike traditional methods, the LC prioritizes the cohesion of the federation by minimizing the maximum dissatisfaction among all potential subgroups, ensuring that no participant has an incentive to break away. To adapt this game-theoretic concept to practical, large-scale networks, we propose a streamlined implementation with a stack-based pruning algorithm, effectively balancing computational efficiency with allocation precision. Case studies in federated intrusion detection demonstrate that our mechanism correctly identifies pivotal contributors and strategic alliances. The results confirm that the practical LC framework promotes stable collaboration and fosters a sustainable FL ecosystem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03387v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy for Long-Horizon Offline Goal-Conditioned RL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03389</link><description>arXiv:2602.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning remains challenging for long-horizon tasks. While hierarchical approaches mitigate this issue by decomposing tasks, most existing methods rely on separate high- and low-level networks and generate only a single intermediate subgoal, making them inadequate for complex tasks that require coordinating multiple intermediate decisions. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the chain-of-thought paradigm and propose the Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy (CoGHP), a novel framework that reformulates hierarchical decision-making as autoregressive sequence modeling within a unified architecture. Given a state and a final goal, CoGHP autoregressively generates a sequence of latent subgoals followed by the primitive action, where each latent subgoal acts as a reasoning step that conditions subsequent predictions. To implement this efficiently, we pioneer the use of an MLP-Mixer backbone, which supports cross-token communication and captures structural relationships among state, goal, latent subgoals, and action. Across challenging navigation and manipulation benchmarks, CoGHP consistently outperforms strong offline baselines, demonstrating improved performance on long-horizon tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03389v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Vicious to Virtuous Cycles: Synergistic Representation Learning for Unsupervised Video Object-Centric Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03390</link><description>arXiv:2602.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised object-centric learning models, particularly slot-based architectures, have shown great promise in decomposing complex scenes. However, their reliance on reconstruction-based training creates a fundamental conflict between the sharp, high-frequency attention maps of the encoder and the spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps of the decoder. We identify that this discrepancy gives rise to a vicious cycle: the noisy feature map from the encoder forces the decoder to average over possibilities and produce even blurrier outputs, while the gradient computed from blurry reconstruction maps lacks high-frequency details necessary to supervise encoder features. To break this cycle, we introduce Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) that establishes a virtuous cycle where the encoder and decoder mutually refine one another. SRL leverages the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary within the decoder output, while exploiting the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise the encoder's features. This mutual refinement process is stabilized by a warm-up phase with a slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot. By bridging the representational gap between the encoder and decoder, SRL achieves state-of-the-art results on video object-centric learning benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/hynnsk/SRL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03390v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Entropy Dynamics in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03392</link><description>arXiv:2602.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy serves as a critical metric for measuring the diversity of outputs generated by large language models (LLMs), providing valuable insights into their exploration capabilities. While recent studies increasingly focus on monitoring and adjusting entropy to better balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the entropy dynamics during the RFT process, which begins with a discriminant expression that quantifies entropy change under a single logit update. This foundation enables the derivation of a first-order expression for entropy change, which can be further extended to the update formula of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The corollaries and insights drawn from the theoretical analysis inspire the design of entropy control methods, and also offer a unified lens for interpreting various entropy-based methods in existing studies. We provide empirical evidence to support the main conclusions of our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived entropy-discriminator clipping methods. This study yields novel insights into RFT training dynamics, providing theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03392v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Label Horizon Paradox: Rethinking Supervision Targets in Financial Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03395</link><description>arXiv:2602.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized financial forecasting through sophisticated architectures, the design of the supervision signal itself is rarely scrutinized. We challenge the canonical assumption that training labels must strictly mirror inference targets, uncovering the Label Horizon Paradox: the optimal supervision signal often deviates from the prediction goal, shifting across intermediate horizons governed by market dynamics. We theoretically ground this phenomenon in a dynamic signal-noise trade-off, demonstrating that generalization hinges on the competition between marginal signal realization and noise accumulation. To operationalize this insight, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies the optimal proxy label within a single training run. Extensive experiments on large-scale financial datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, thereby opening new avenues for label-centric research in financial forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03395v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Distillation-Resistant Large Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03396</link><description>arXiv:2602.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proprietary large language models (LLMs) embody substantial economic value and are generally exposed only as black-box APIs, yet adversaries can still exploit their outputs to extract knowledge via distillation. Existing defenses focus exclusively on text-based distillation, leaving the important logit-based distillation largely unexplored. In this work, we analyze this problem and present an effective solution from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize distillation-relevant information in teacher outputs using the conditional mutual information (CMI) between teacher logits and input queries conditioned on ground-truth labels. This quantity captures contextual information beneficial for model extraction, motivating us to defend distillation via CMI minimization. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we propose learning a transformation matrix that purifies the original outputs to enhance distillation resistance. We further derive a CMI-inspired anti-distillation objective to optimize this transformation, which effectively removes distillation-relevant information while preserving output utility. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and strong distillation algorithms demonstrate that the proposed method significantly degrades distillation performance while preserving task accuracy, effectively protecting models' intellectual property.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03396v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Navigation Efficiency of Quadruped Robots via Leveraging Personal Transportation Platforms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03397</link><description>arXiv:2602.03397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadruped robots face limitations in long-range navigation efficiency due to their reliance on legs. To ameliorate the limitations, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning-based Active Transporter Riding method (\textit{RL-ATR}), inspired by humans' utilization of personal transporters, including Segways. The \textit{RL-ATR} features a transporter riding policy and two state estimators. The policy devises adequate maneuvering strategies according to transporter-specific control dynamics, while the estimators resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation validate proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions within the \textit{RL-ATR}. This riding ability could broaden the locomotion modalities of quadruped robots, potentially expanding the operational range and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03397v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Precision in Practice: Knowledge Guided Code Summarizing Grounded in Industrial Expectations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03400</link><description>arXiv:2602.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code summaries are essential for helping developers understand code functionality and reducing maintenance and collaboration costs. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic code summarization, the practical usefulness of generated summaries in industrial settings remains insufficiently explored. In collaboration with documentation experts from the industrial HarmonyOS project, we conducted a questionnaire study showing that over 57.4% of code summaries produced by state-of-the-art approaches were rejected due to violations of developers' expectations for industrial documentation. Beyond semantic similarity to reference summaries, developers emphasize additional requirements, including the use of appropriate domain terminology, explicit function categorization, and the avoidance of redundant implementation details.
  To address these expectations, we propose ExpSum, an expectation-aware code summarization approach that integrates function metadata abstraction, informative metadata filtering, context-aware domain knowledge retrieval, and constraint-driven prompting to guide LLMs in generating structured, expectation-aligned summaries. We evaluate ExpSum on the HarmonyOS project and widely used code summarization benchmarks. Experimental results show that ExpSum consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving improvements of up to 26.71% in BLEU-4 and 20.10% in ROUGE-L on HarmonyOS. Furthermore, LLM-based evaluations indicate that ExpSum-generated summaries better align with developer expectations across other projects, demonstrating its effectiveness for industrial code documentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03400v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Risk Awareness Injection: Calibrating Vision-Language Models for Safety without Compromising Utility</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03402</link><description>arXiv:2602.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) extend the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to cross-modal settings, yet remain highly vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks. Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03402v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feasible strategies for conflict resolution within intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03403</link><description>arXiv:2602.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In three-way conflict analysis, preference-based conflict situations characterize agents' attitudes towards issues by formally modeling their preferences over pairs of issues. However, existing preference-based conflict models rely exclusively on three qualitative relations, namely, preference, converse, and indifference, to describe agents' attitudes towards issue pairs, which significantly limits their capacity in capturing the essence of conflict. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set. Additionally, relative loss functions built on the proposed conflict functions are employed to calculate thresholds for three-way conflict analysis. Finally, we present adjustment mechanism-based feasible strategies that simultaneously account for both adjustment magnitudes and conflict degrees, together with an algorithm for constructing such feasible strategies, and provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03403v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep-Learning-Based Control of a Decoupled Two-Segment Continuum Robot for Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03406</link><description>arXiv:2602.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is technically demanding, and existing single-segment robotic tools offer limited dexterity. These limitations motivate the development of more advanced solutions. To address this, DESectBot, a novel dual segment continuum robot with a decoupled structure and integrated surgical forceps, enabling 6 degrees of freedom (DoFs) tip dexterity for improved lesion targeting in ESD, was developed in this work. Deep learning controllers based on gated recurrent units (GRUs) for simultaneous tip position and orientation control, effectively handling the nonlinear coupling between continuum segments, were proposed. The GRU controller was benchmarked against Jacobian based inverse kinematics, model predictive control (MPC), a feedforward neural network (FNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In nested-rectangle and Lissajous trajectory tracking tasks, the GRU achieved the lowest position/orientation RMSEs: 1.11 mm/ 4.62{\deg} and 0.81 mm/ 2.59{\deg}, respectively. For orientation control at a fixed position (four target poses), the GRU attained a mean RMSE of 0.14 mm and 0.72{\deg}, outperforming all alternatives. In a peg transfer task, the GRU achieved a 100% success rate (120 success/120 attempts) with an average transfer time of 11.8s, the STD significantly outperforms novice-controlled systems. Additionally, an ex vivo ESD demonstration grasping, elevating, and resecting tissue as the scalpel completed the cut confirmed that DESectBot provides sufficient stiffness to divide thick gastric mucosa and an operative workspace adequate for large lesions.These results confirm that GRU-based control significantly enhances precision, reliability, and usability in ESD surgical training scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03406v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Universal Costas Matrices: Towards a General Framework for Costas Array Construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03407</link><description>arXiv:2602.03407v1 Announce Type: new

Leveraging the structural properties of UCMs and UCFMs, a reconstruction-based search method is developed to generate UCMs from UCFMs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly accelerates the search process and enhances structural insight into Costas array generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UnHype: CLIP-Guided Hypernetworks for Dynamic LoRA Unlearning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03410</link><description>arXiv:2602.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale diffusion models have intensified concerns about their potential misuse, particularly in generating realistic yet harmful or socially disruptive content. This challenge has spurred growing interest in effective machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing specific knowledge or concepts from a model without compromising its overall generative capabilities. Among various approaches, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective and efficient method for fine-tuning models toward targeted unlearning. However, LoRA-based methods often exhibit limited adaptability to concept semantics and struggle to balance removing closely related concepts with maintaining generalization across broader meanings. Moreover, these methods face scalability challenges when multiple concepts must be erased simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce UnHype, a framework that incorporates hypernetworks into single- and multi-concept LoRA training. The proposed architecture can be directly plugged into Stable Diffusion as well as modern flow-based text-to-image models, where it demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights based on the CLIP embedding, enabling more context-aware, scalable unlearning. We evaluate UnHype across several challenging tasks, including object erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content removal, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present SWE-Master, an open-source and fully reproducible post-training framework for building effective software engineering agents. SWE-Master systematically explores the complete agent development pipeline, including teacher-trajectory synthesis and data curation, long-horizon SFT, RL with real execution feedback, and inference framework design. Starting from an open-source base model with limited initial SWE capability, SWE-Master demonstrates how systematical optimization method can elicit strong long-horizon SWE task solving abilities. We evaluate SWE-Master on SWE-bench Verified, a standard benchmark for realistic software engineering tasks. Under identical experimental settings, our approach achieves a resolve rate of 61.4\% with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines. By further incorporating test-time scaling~(TTS) with LLM-based environment feedback, SWE-Master reaches 70.8\% at TTS@8, demonstrating a strong performance potential. SWE-Master provides a practical and transparent foundation for advancing reproducible research on software engineering agents.

Abstract: As large language model agents tackle increasingly complex long-horizon tasks, effective post-training becomes critical. Prior work faces fundamental challenges: outcome-only rewards fail to precisely attribute credit to intermediate steps, estimated step-level rewards introduce systematic noise, and Monte Carlo sampling approaches for step reward estimation incur prohibitive computational cost. Inspired by findings that only a small fraction of high-entropy tokens drive effective RL for reasoning, we propose Critical Step Optimization (CSO), which focuses preference learning on verified critical steps, decision points where alternate actions demonstrably flip task outcomes from failure to success. Crucially, our method starts from failed policy trajectories rather than expert demonstrations, directly targeting the policy model's weaknesses. We use a process reward model (PRM) to identify candidate critical steps, leverage expert models to propose high-quality alternatives, then continue execution from these alternatives using the policy model itself until task completion. Only alternatives that the policy successfully executes to correct outcomes are verified and used as DPO training data, ensuring both quality and policy reachability. This yields fine-grained, verifiable supervision at critical decisions while avoiding trajectory-level coarseness and step-level noise. Experiments on GAIA-Text-103 and XBench-DeepSearch show that CSO achieves 37% and 26% relative improvement over the SFT baseline and substantially outperforms other post-training methods, while requiring supervision at only 16% of trajectory steps. This demonstrates the effectiveness of selective verification-based learning for agent post-training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03412v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Socratic-Geo: Synthetic Data Generation and Geometric Reasoning via Multi-Agent Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03414</link><description>arXiv:2602.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced vision-language understanding. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle with geometric reasoning, revealing a critical bottleneck: the extreme scarcity of high-quality image-text pairs. Human annotation is prohibitively expensive, while automated methods fail to ensure fidelity and training effectiveness. Existing approaches either passively adapt to available images or employ inefficient random exploration with filtering, decoupling generation from learning needs. We propose Socratic-Geo, a fully autonomous framework that dynamically couples data synthesis with model learning through multi-agent interaction. The Teacher agent generates parameterized Python scripts with reflective feedback (Reflect for solvability, RePI for visual validity), ensuring image-text pair purity. The Solver agent optimizes reasoning through preference learning, with failure paths guiding Teacher's targeted augmentation. Independently, the Generator learns image generation capabilities on accumulated "image-code-instruction" triplets, distilling programmatic drawing intelligence into visual generation. Starting from only 108 seed problems, Socratic-Solver achieves 49.11 on six benchmarks using one-quarter of baseline data, surpassing strong baselines by 2.43 points. Socratic-Generator achieves 42.4% on GenExam, establishing new state-of-the-art for open-source models, surpassing Seedream-4.0 (39.8%) and approaching Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image (43.1%).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03414v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Most Convolutional Networks Suffer from Small Adversarial Perturbations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03415</link><description>arXiv:2602.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of adversarial examples is relatively understood for random fully connected neural networks, but much less so for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The recent work [Daniely, 2025] establishes that adversarial examples can be found in CNNs, in some non-optimal distance from the input. We extend over this work and prove that adversarial examples in random CNNs with input dimension $d$ can be found already in $\ell_2$-distance of order $\lVert x \rVert /\sqrt{d}$ from the input $x$, which is essentially the nearest possible. We also show that such adversarial small perturbations can be found using a single step of gradient descent. To derive our results we use Fourier decomposition to efficiently bound the singular values of a random linear convolutional operator, which is the main ingredient of a CNN layer. This bound might be of independent interest.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03415v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AesRec: A Dataset for Aesthetics-Aligned Clothing Outfit Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03416</link><description>arXiv:2602.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clothing recommendation extends beyond merely generating personalized outfits; it serves as a crucial medium for aesthetic guidance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on user-item-outfit interaction behaviors while overlooking explicit representations of clothing aesthetics. To bridge this gap, we present the AesRec benchmark dataset featuring systematic quantitative aesthetic annotations, thereby enabling the development of aesthetics-aligned recommendation systems. Grounded in professional apparel quality standards and fashion aesthetic principles, we define a multidimensional set of indicators. At the item level, six dimensions are independently assessed: silhouette, chromaticity, materiality, craftsmanship, wearability, and item-level impression. Transitioning to the outfit level, the evaluation retains the first five core attributes while introducing stylistic synergy, visual harmony, and outfit-level impression as distinct metrics to capture the collective aesthetic impact. Given the increasing human-like proficiency of Vision-Language Models in multimodal understanding and interaction, we leverage them for large-scale aesthetic scoring. We conduct rigorous human-machine consistency validation on a fashion dataset, confirming the reliability of the generated ratings. Experimental results based on AesRec further demonstrate that integrating quantified aesthetic information into clothing recommendation models can provide aesthetic guidance for users while fulfilling their personalized requirements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03416v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FactNet: A Billion-Scale Knowledge Graph for Multilingual Factual Grounding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03417</link><description>arXiv:2602.03417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While LLMs exhibit remarkable fluency, their utility is often compromised by factual hallucinations and a lack of traceable provenance. Existing resources for grounding mitigate this but typically enforce a dichotomy: they offer either structured knowledge without textual context (e.g., knowledge bases) or grounded text with limited scale and linguistic coverage. To bridge this gap, we introduce FactNet, a massive, open-source resource designed to unify 1.7 billion atomic assertions with 3.01 billion auditable evidence pointers derived exclusively from 316 Wikipedia editions. Unlike recent synthetic approaches, FactNet employs a strictly deterministic construction pipeline, ensuring that every evidence unit is recoverable with byte-level precision. Extensive auditing confirms a high grounding precision of 92.1%, even in long-tail languages. Furthermore, we establish FactNet-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation suite for Knowledge Graph Completion, Question Answering, and Fact Checking. FactNet provides the community with a foundational, reproducible resource for training and evaluating trustworthy, verifiable multilingual systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03417v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning-based Initialization of Trajectory Optimization for Path-following Problems of Redundant Manipulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03418</link><description>arXiv:2602.03418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory optimization (TO) is an efficient tool to generate a redundant manipulator's joint trajectory following a 6-dimensional Cartesian path. The optimization performance largely depends on the quality of initial trajectories. However, the selection of a high-quality initial trajectory is non-trivial and requires a considerable time budget due to the extremely large space of the solution trajectories and the lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space. To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations. Our statistical evaluation in simulation shows the improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of TO when we plug in our method's output, compared with three other baselines. We also show the performance improvement and feasibility via real-world experiments with a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03418v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SWE-World: Building Software Engineering Agents in Docker-Free Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03419</link><description>arXiv:2602.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled software engineering agents to tackle complex code modification tasks. Most existing approaches rely on execution feedback from containerized environments, which require dependency-complete setup and physical execution of programs and tests. While effective, this paradigm is resource-intensive and difficult to maintain, substantially complicating agent training and limiting scalability. We propose SWE-World, a Docker-free framework that replaces physical execution environments with a learned surrogate for training and evaluating software engineering agents. SWE-World leverages LLM-based models trained on real agent-environment interaction data to predict intermediate execution outcomes and final test feedback, enabling agents to learn without interacting with physical containerized environments. This design preserves the standard agent-environment interaction loop while eliminating the need for costly environment construction and maintenance during agent optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, because SWE-World can simulate the final evaluation outcomes of candidate trajectories without real submission, it enables selecting the best solution among multiple test-time attempts, thereby facilitating effective test-time scaling (TTS) in software engineering tasks. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that SWE-World raises Qwen2.5-Coder-32B from 6.2\% to 52.0\% via Docker-free SFT, 55.0\% with Docker-free RL, and 68.2\% with further TTS.

Abstract: Emotional expression in human speech is nuanced and compositional, often involving multiple, sometimes conflicting, affective cues that may diverge from linguistic content. In contrast, most expressive text-to-speech systems enforce a single utterance-level emotion, collapsing affective diversity and suppressing mixed or text-emotion-misaligned expression. While activation steering via latent direction vectors offers a promising solution, it remains unclear whether emotion representations are linearly steerable in TTS, where steering should be applied within hybrid TTS architectures, and how such complex emotion behaviors should be evaluated. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of activation steering for emotional control in hybrid TTS models, introducing a quantitative, controllable steering framework, and multi-rater evaluation protocols that enable composable mixed-emotion synthesis and reliable text-emotion mismatch synthesis. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that emotional prosody and expressive variability are primarily synthesized by the TTS language module instead of the flow-matching module, and also provide a lightweight steering approach for generating natural, human-like emotional speech.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03420v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On (Im)possibility of Network Oblivious Transfer via Noisy Channels and Non-Signaling Correlations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03421</link><description>arXiv:2602.03421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the fundamental limits of implementing network oblivious transfer via noisy multiple access channels and broadcast channels between honest-but-curious parties when the parties have access to general tripartite non-signaling correlations. By modeling the shared resource as an arbitrary tripartite non-signaling box, we obtain a unified perspective on both the channel behavior and the resulting correlations. Our main result demonstrates that perfect oblivious transfer is impossible. In the asymptotic regime, we further show that even negligible leakage cannot be achieved, as repeated use of the resource amplifies the receiver(s)'s ability to distinguish messages that were not intended for him/them. In contrast, the receiver(s)'s own privacy is not subject to a universal impossibility limitation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03421v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RankSteer: Activation Steering for Pointwise LLM Ranking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03422</link><description>arXiv:2602.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance as zero-shot rankers, yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt formulation, particularly role-play instructions. Prior analyses suggest that role-related signals are encoded along activation channels that are largely separate from query-document representations, raising the possibility of steering ranking behavior directly at the activation level rather than through brittle prompt engineering. In this work, we propose RankSteer, a post-hoc activation steering framework for zero-shot pointwise LLM ranking. We characterize ranking behavior through three disentangled and steerable directions in representation space: a \textbf{decision direction} that maps hidden states to relevance scores, an \textbf{evidence direction} that captures relevance signals not directly exploited by the decision head, and a \textbf{role direction} that modulates model behavior without injecting relevance information. Using projection-based interventions at inference time, RankSteer jointly controls these directions to calibrate ranking behavior without modifying model weights or introducing explicit cross-document comparisons. Experiments on TREC DL 20 and multiple BEIR benchmarks show that RankSteer consistently improves ranking quality using only a small number of anchor queries, demonstrating that substantial ranking capacity remains under-utilized in pointwise LLM rankers. We further provide a geometric analysis revealing that steering improves ranking by stabilizing ranking geometry and reducing dispersion, offering new insight into how LLMs internally represent and calibrate relevance judgments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03422v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Origin Lens: A Privacy-First Mobile Framework for Cryptographic Image Provenance and AI Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03423</link><description>arXiv:2602.03423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI poses challenges for information integrity assurance, requiring systems that connect model governance with end-user verification. We present Origin Lens, a privacy-first mobile framework that targets visual disinformation through a layered verification architecture. Unlike server-side detection systems, Origin Lens performs cryptographic image provenance verification and AI detection locally on the device via a Rust/Flutter hybrid architecture. Our system integrates multiple signals - including cryptographic provenance, generative model fingerprints, and optional retrieval-augmented verification - to provide users with graded confidence indicators at the point of consumption.

Abstract: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on flow-based models is crucial for preference alignment. However, they often introduce visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment. This work preliminarily explores why visual hallucinations arise and how to reduce them. We first investigate RFT methods from a unified perspective, and reveal the core problems stemming from two aspects, exploration and exploitation: (1) limited exploration during stochastic differential equation (SDE) rollouts, leading to an over-emphasis on local details at the expense of global semantics, and (2) trajectory imitation process inherent in policy gradient methods, distorting the model's foundational vector field and its cross-step consistency. Building on this, we propose ConsistentRFT, a general framework to mitigate these hallucinations. Specifically, we design a Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism to balance exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources. We then introduce a Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves the model's consistency by aligning the current policy with a more stable prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistentRFT significantly mitigates visual hallucinations, achieving average reductions of 49\% for low-level and 38\% for high-level perceptual hallucinations. Furthermore, ConsistentRFT outperforms other RFT methods on out-of-domain metrics, showing an improvement of 5.1\% (v.s. the baseline's decrease of -0.4\%) over FLUX1.dev.

Abstract: To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking "what kind of tone do you want?" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03429v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProAct: A Benchmark and Multimodal Framework for Structure-Aware Proactive Response</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03430</link><description>arXiv:2602.03430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While passive agents merely follow instructions, proactive agents align with higher-level objectives, such as assistance and safety by continuously monitoring the environment to determine when and how to act. However, developing proactive agents is hindered by the lack of specialized resources. To address this, we introduce ProAct-75, a benchmark designed to train and evaluate proactive agents across diverse domains, including assistance, maintenance, and safety monitoring. Spanning 75 tasks, our dataset features 91,581 step-level annotations enriched with explicit task graphs. These graphs encode step dependencies and parallel execution possibilities, providing the structural grounding necessary for complex decision-making. Building on this benchmark, we propose ProAct-Helper, a reference baseline powered by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that grounds decision-making in state detection, and leveraging task graphs to enable entropy-driven heuristic search for action selection, allowing agents to execute parallel threads independently rather than mirroring the human's next step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProAct-Helper outperforms strong closed-source models, improving trigger detection mF1 by 6.21%, saving 0.25 more steps in online one-step decision, and increasing the rate of parallel actions by 15.58%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Failure is Feedback: History-Aware Backtracking for Agentic Traversal in Multimodal Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03432</link><description>arXiv:2602.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-domain multimodal document retrieval aims to retrieve specific components (paragraphs, tables, or images) from large and interconnected document corpora. Existing graph-based retrieval approaches typically rely on a uniform similarity metric that overlooks hop-specific semantics, and their rigid pre-defined plans hinder dynamic error correction. These limitations suggest that a retriever should adapt its reasoning to the evolving context and recover intelligently from dead ends. To address these needs, we propose Failure is Feedback (FiF), which casts subgraph retrieval as a sequential decision process and introduces two key innovations. (i) We introduce a history-aware backtracking mechanism; unlike standard backtracking that simply reverts the state, our approach piggybacks on the context of failed traversals, leveraging insights from previous failures. (ii) We implement an economically-rational agentic workflow. Unlike conventional agents with static strategies, our orchestrator employs a cost-aware traversal method to dynamically manage the trade-off between retrieval accuracy and inference costs, escalating to intensive LLM-based reasoning only when the prior failure justifies the additional computational investment. Extensive experiments show that FiF achieves state-of-the-art retrieval on the benchmarks of MultimodalQA, MMCoQA and WebQA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03432v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When control meets large language models: From words to dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03433</link><description>arXiv:2602.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are transforming engineering and technology through enhanced control capabilities and decision support, they are simultaneously evolving into complex dynamical systems whose behavior must be regulated. This duality highlights a reciprocal connection in which prompts support control system design while control theory helps shape prompts to achieve specific goals efficiently. In this study, we frame this emerging interconnection of LLM and control as a bidirectional continuum, from prompt design to system dynamics. First, we investigate how LLMs can advance the field of control in two distinct capacities: directly, by assisting in the design and synthesis of controllers, and indirectly, by augmenting research workflows. Second, we examine how control concepts help LLMs steer their trajectories away from undesired meanings, improving reachability and alignment via input optimization, parameter editing, and activation-level interventions. Third, we look into deeper integrations by treating LLMs as dynamic systems within a state-space framework, where their internal representations are closely linked to external control loops. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future research directions to understand LLM behavior and develop interpretable and controllable LLMs that are as trustworthy and robust as their electromechanical counterparts, thereby ensuring they continue to support and safeguard society.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ontology-to-tools compilation for executable semantic constraint enforcement in LLM agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03439</link><description>arXiv:2602.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ontology-to-tools compilation as a proof-of-principle mechanism for coupling large language models (LLMs) with formal domain knowledge. Within The World Avatar (TWA), ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use to create and modify knowledge graph instances, enforcing semantic constraints during generation rather than through post-hoc validation. Extending TWA's semantic agent composition framework, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and associated agents are integral components of the knowledge graph ecosystem, enabling structured interaction between generative models, symbolic constraints, and external resources. An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text. Using metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature as an illustrative case, we show how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behaviour and reduce manual schema and prompt engineering, establishing a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A-RAG: Scaling Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Hierarchical Retrieval Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03442</link><description>arXiv:2602.03442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier language models have demonstrated strong reasoning and long-horizon tool-use capabilities. However, existing RAG systems fail to leverage these capabilities. They still rely on two paradigms: (1) designing an algorithm that retrieves passages in a single shot and concatenates them into the model's input, or (2) predefining a workflow and prompting the model to execute it step-by-step. Neither paradigm allows the model to participate in retrieval decisions, preventing efficient scaling with model improvements. In this paper, we introduce A-RAG, an Agentic RAG framework that exposes hierarchical retrieval interfaces directly to the model. A-RAG provides three retrieval tools: keyword search, semantic search, and chunk read, enabling the agent to adaptively search and retrieve information across multiple granularities. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks show that A-RAG consistently outperforms existing approaches with comparable or lower retrieved tokens, demonstrating that A-RAG effectively leverages model capabilities and dynamically adapts to different RAG tasks. We further systematically study how A-RAG scales with model size and test-time compute. We will release our code and evaluation suite to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Lifelong learning is critical for embodied agents in open-world environments, where reinforcement learning fine-tuning has emerged as an important paradigm to enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to master dexterous manipulation through environmental interaction. Thus, Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a promising pathway for deploying VLA models in lifelong robotic scenarios, yet balancing stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) remains a formidable challenge for existing methods. We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that CRL-VLA effectively harmonizes these conflicting objectives, outperforming baselines in both anti-forgetting and forward adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03445v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HetroD: A High-Fidelity Drone Dataset and Benchmark for Autonomous Driving in Heterogeneous Traffic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03447</link><description>arXiv:2602.03447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HetroD, a dataset and benchmark for developing autonomous driving systems in heterogeneous environments. HetroD targets the critical challenge of navi- gating real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulner- able road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists that interact with vehicles. These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize images that faithfully preserve the identities of multiple reference subjects while following textual instructions. However, existing methods often suffer from identity inconsistency and limited compositional control, as they rely on diffusion models to implicitly associate text prompts with reference images. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance (CAG), a framework that provides explicit, structured supervision from high-level concepts to fine-grained appearances. At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues. At the appearance level, we integrate the VLM-derived correspondences into a correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This module restricts each text token to attend only to its matched reference regions, ensuring precise attribute binding and reliable multi-subject composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multi-subject image generation, substantially improving prompt following and subject consistency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03448v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Variance: Prompt-Efficient RLVR via Rare-Event Amplification and Bidirectional Pairing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03452</link><description>arXiv:2602.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is effective for training large language models on deterministic outcome reasoning tasks. Prior work shows RLVR works with few prompts, but prompt selection is often based only on training-accuracy variance, leading to unstable optimization directions and weaker transfer. We revisit prompt selection from a mechanism-level view and argue that an effective minibatch should provide both (i) a reliable positive anchor and (ii) explicit negative learning signals from rare failures. Based on this principle, we propose \emph{positive--negative pairing}: at each update, we sample a hard-but-solvable $q^{+}$ and an easy-but-brittle prompt $q^{-}$(high success rate but not perfect), characterized by low and high empirical success rates under multiple rollouts. We further introduce Weighted GRPO, which reweights binary outcomes at the pair level and uses group-normalized advantages to amplify rare successes on $q^{+}$ into sharp positive guidance while turning rare failures on $q^{-}$ into strong negative penalties. This bidirectional signal provides informative learning feedback for both successes and failures, improving sample efficiency without suppressing exploration. On Qwen2.5-Math-7B, a single paired minibatch per update consistently outperforms a GRPO baseline that selects two prompts via commonly used variance-based selection heuristics: AIME~2025 Pass@8 improves from 16.8 to 22.2, and AMC23 Pass@64 from 94.0 to 97.0, while remaining competitive with large-scale RLVR trained from a pool of 1209 training prompts. Similar gains are observed on Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03452v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Contextualized Visual Personalization in Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03454</link><description>arXiv:2602.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches often fail to generate personalized responses based on the user's specific experiences, as they lack the ability to associate visual inputs with a user's accumulated visual-textual context. We newly formalize this challenge as contextualized visual personalization, which requires the visual recognition and textual retrieval of personalized visual experiences by VLMs when interpreting new images. To address this issue, we propose CoViP, a unified framework that treats personalized image captioning as a core task for contextualized visual personalization and improves this capability through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation. We further introduce diagnostic evaluations that explicitly rule out textual shortcut solutions and verify whether VLMs truly leverage visual context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that existing open-source and proprietary VLMs exhibit substantial limitations, while CoViP not only improves personalized image captioning but also yields holistic gains across downstream personalization tasks. These results highlight CoViP as a crucial stage for enabling robust and generalizable contextualized visual personalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03454v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Game-Theoretic and Algorithmic Analyses of Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Costs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03455</link><description>arXiv:2602.03455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating the movement of multiple autonomous agents over a shared network is a fundamental challenge in algorithmic robotics, intelligent transportation, and distributed systems. The dominant approach, Multi-Agent Path Finding, relies on centralized control and synchronous collision avoidance, which often requires strict synchronization and guarantees of globally conflict-free execution. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Cost model on mixed graphs, a novel framework tailored to asynchronous settings. In our model, instead of treating conflicts as hard constraints, each agent is assigned a path, and the system is evaluated through a cost function that measures potential head-on encounters. This ``crossing cost'', which is defined as the product of the numbers of agents traversing an edge in opposite directions, quantifies the risk of congestion and delay in decentralized execution.
  Our contributions are both game-theoretic and algorithmic. We model the setting as a congestion game with a non-standard cost function, prove the existence of pure Nash equilibria, and analyze the dynamics leading to them. Equilibria can be found in polynomial time under mild conditions, while the general case is PLS-complete. From an optimization perspective, minimizing the total crossing cost is NP-hard, as the problem generalizes Steiner Orientation. To address this hardness barrier, we design a suite of parameterized algorithms for minimizing crossing cost, with parameters including the number of arcs, edges, agents, and structural graph measures. These yield XP or FPT results depending on the parameter, offering algorithmic strategies for structurally restricted instances. Our framework provides a new theoretical foundation for decentralized multi-agent routing, bridging equilibrium analysis and parameterized complexity to support scalable and risk-aware coordination.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03455v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Inference on Networks under Misspecified Exposure Mappings: A Partial Identification Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03459</link><description>arXiv:2602.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating treatment effects in networks is challenging, as each potential outcome depends on the treatments of all other nodes in the network. To overcome this difficulty, existing methods typically impose an exposure mapping that compresses the treatment assignments in the network into a low-dimensional summary. However, if this mapping is misspecified, standard estimators for direct and spillover effects can be severely biased. We propose a novel partial identification framework for causal inference on networks to assess the robustness of treatment effects under misspecifications of the exposure mapping. Specifically, we derive sharp upper and lower bounds on direct and spillover effects under such misspecifications. As such, our framework presents a novel application of causal sensitivity analysis to exposure mappings. We instantiate our framework for three canonical exposure settings widely used in practice: (i) weighted means of the neighborhood treatments, (ii) threshold-based exposure mappings, and (iii) truncated neighborhood interference in the presence of higher-order spillovers. Furthermore, we develop orthogonal estimators for these bounds and prove that the resulting bound estimates are valid, sharp, and efficient. Our experiments show the bounds remain informative and provide reliable conclusions under misspecification of exposure mappings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03459v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Soft-Radial Projection for Constrained End-to-End Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03461</link><description>arXiv:2602.03461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating hard constraints into deep learning is essential for safety-critical systems. Yet existing constructive layers that project predictions onto constraint boundaries face a fundamental bottleneck: gradient saturation. By collapsing exterior points onto lower-dimensional surfaces, standard orthogonal projections induce rank-deficient Jacobians, which nullify gradients orthogonal to active constraints and hinder optimization. We introduce Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable reparameterization layer that circumvents this issue through a radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set. This construction guarantees strict feasibility while preserving a full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere, thereby preventing the optimization stalls typical of boundary-based methods. We theoretically prove that the architecture retains the universal approximation property and empirically show improved convergence behavior and solution quality over state-of-the-art optimization- and projection-based baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03461v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAL-Bench: Benchmarking for Application-Level Functional Correctness and Non-Functional Quality Attributes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03462</link><description>arXiv:2602.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code generation has advanced rapidly with code-focused large language models (LLMs), especially on snippet-level tasks. However, application-level generation requires producing a runnable multi-file repository with correct structure, dependencies, and end-to-end executability, and real-world software must satisfy both functional correctness and non-functional quality (e.g., maintainability, security). Existing benchmarks provide a limited execution-based assessment of these requirements at the application level. We ask: Can current LLMs generate application-level repositories that meet both functional and non-functional criteria? We propose RAL-Bench, a benchmark and evaluation framework for application-level code generation. For each task, we distill a concise natural-language requirement from a high-quality reference project, build black-box system tests covering functional and non-functional attributes, and keep only tests that pass on the reference repository to ensure a sound oracle and an end-to-end executable suite. Functional correctness is measured by system-test pass rate. Non-functional quality is measured along five ISO/IEC 25010-inspired dimensions and aggregated with an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-derived weight vector, with per-dimension diagnostics and baseline-normalized scoring using reference measurements. Across 16 LLMs evaluated zero-shot with greedy decoding, functional correctness is the dominant bottleneck: no model exceeds a 45% functional pass rate under our requirement-driven, reference-validated tests. We release RAL-Bench at https://github.com/Wwstarry/RAL-Bench. .</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03462v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Dual Role of Abstracting over the Irrelevant in Symbolic Explanations: Cognitive Effort vs. Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03467</link><description>arXiv:2602.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explanations are central to human cognition, yet AI systems often produce outputs that are difficult to understand. While symbolic AI offers a transparent foundation for interpretability, raw logical traces often impose a high extraneous cognitive load. We investigate how formal abstractions, specifically removal and clustering, impact human reasoning performance and cognitive effort. Utilizing Answer Set Programming (ASP) as a formal framework, we define a notion of irrelevant details to be abstracted over to obtain simplified explanations. Our cognitive experiments, in which participants classified stimuli across domains with explanations derived from an answer set program, show that clustering details significantly improve participants' understanding, while removal of details significantly reduce cognitive effort, supporting the hypothesis that abstraction enhances human-centered symbolic explanations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03467v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IntentRL: Training Proactive User-intent Agents for Open-ended Deep Research via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03468</link><description>arXiv:2602.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents extend Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge by autonomously retrieving and synthesizing evidence from large web corpora into long-form reports, enabling a long-horizon agentic paradigm. However, unlike real-time conversational assistants, DR is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating an autonomy-interaction dilemma: high autonomy on ambiguous user queries often leads to prolonged execution with unsatisfactory outcomes. To address this, we propose IntentRL, a framework that trains proactive agents to clarify latent user intents before starting long-horizon research. To overcome the scarcity of open-ended research data, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands a few seed samples into high-quality dialogue turns via a shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph. We further adopt a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: Stage I applies RL on offline dialogues to efficiently learn general user-interaction behavior, while Stage II uses the trained agent and a user simulator for online rollouts to strengthen adaptation to diverse user feedback. Extensive experiments show that IntentRL significantly improves both intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming the built-in clarify modules of closed-source DR agents and proactive LLM baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03468v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reading Between the Code Lines: On the Use of Self-Admitted Technical Debt for Security Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03470</link><description>arXiv:2602.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static Analysis Tools (SATs) are central to security engineering activities, as they enable early identification of code weaknesses without requiring execution. However, their effectiveness is often limited by high false-positive rates and incomplete coverage of vulnerability classes. At the same time, developers frequently document security-related shortcuts and compromises as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in software artifacts, such as code comments. While prior work has recognized SATD as a rich source of security information, it remains unclear whether -and in what ways- it is utilized during SAT-aided security analysis. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the extent to which security-related SATD complements the output produced by SATs and helps bridge some of their well-known limitations. METHOD: We followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of (i) the analysis of a SATD-annotated vulnerability dataset using three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) an online survey with 72 security practitioners. RESULTS: The combined use of all SATs flagged 114 of the 135 security-related SATD instances, spanning 24 distinct Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. A manual mapping of the SATD comments revealed 33 unique CWE types, 6 of which correspond to categories that SATs commonly overlook or struggle to detect (e.g., race conditions). Survey responses further suggest that developers frequently pair SAT outputs with SATD insights to better understand the impact and root causes of security weaknesses and to identify suitable fixes. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show that such SATD-encoded information can be a meaningful complement to SAT-driven security analysis, while helping to overcome some of SATs' practical shortcomings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03470v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inlier-Centric Post-Training Quantization for Object Detection Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03472</link><description>arXiv:2602.03472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection is pivotal in computer vision, yet its immense computational demands make deployment slow and power-hungry, motivating quantization. However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples. Experiments on the COCO and nuScenes benchmarks show consistent reductions in quantization error for camera-based (2D and 3D) and LiDAR-based (3D) object detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03472v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Continual Learning with Bi-Level Routing Mixture-of-Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03473</link><description>arXiv:2602.03473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning, especially class-incremental learning (CIL), on the basis of a pre-trained model (PTM) has garnered substantial research interest in recent years. However, how to effectively learn both discriminative and comprehensive feature representations while maintaining stability and plasticity over very long task sequences remains an open problem. We propose CaRE, a scalable {C}ontinual Le{a}rner with efficient Bi-Level {R}outing Mixture-of-{E}xperts (BR-MoE). The core idea of BR-MoE is a bi-level routing mechanism: a router selection stage that dynamically activates relevant task-specific routers, followed by an expert routing phase that dynamically activates and aggregates experts, aiming to inject discriminative and comprehensive representations into every intermediate network layer. On the other hand, we introduce a challenging evaluation protocol for comprehensively assessing CIL methods across very long task sequences spanning hundreds of tasks. Extensive experiments show that CaRE demonstrates leading performance across a variety of datasets and task settings, including commonly used CIL datasets with classical CIL settings (e.g., 5-20 tasks). To the best of our knowledge, CaRE is the first continual learner that scales to very long task sequences (ranging from 100 to over 300 non-overlapping tasks), while outperforming all baselines by a large margin on such task sequences. Code will be publicly released at https://github.com/LMMMEng/CaRE.git.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03473v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recursive Energy Efficient Agreement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03474</link><description>arXiv:2602.03474v1 Announce Type: new

Recently, Meir, Mirault, Peleg and Robinson introduced the notion of \emph{Energy Efficient Agreement}, where the goal is to solve Agreement while minimizing the number of round a party participates in, thereby reducing the energy cost per participant. We show a recursive Agreement algorithm that has $O(\log f)$ active rounds per participant, where $f&lt;n$ represents the maximum number of crash faults in the system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03474v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TactDeform: Finger Pad Deformation Inspired Spatial Tactile Feedback for Virtual Geometry Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03476</link><description>arXiv:2602.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial tactile feedback can enhance the realism of geometry exploration in virtual reality applications. Current vibrotactile approaches often face challenges with the spatial and temporal resolution needed to render different 3D geometries. Inspired by the natural deformation of finger pads when exploring 3D objects and surfaces, we propose TactDeform, a parametric approach to render spatio-temporal tactile patterns using a finger-worn electro-tactile interface. The system dynamically renders electro-tactile patterns based on both interaction contexts (approaching, contact, and sliding) and geometric contexts (geometric features and textures), emulating deformations that occur during real-world touch exploration. Results from a user study \rr{(N=24)} show that the proposed approach enabled high texture discrimination and geometric feature identification compared to a baseline. Informed by results from a free 3D-geometry exploration phase, we provide insights that can inform future tactile interface designs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03476v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ScDiVa: Masked Discrete Diffusion for Joint Modeling of Single-Cell Identity and Expression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03477</link><description>arXiv:2602.03477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq profiles are high-dimensional, sparse, and unordered, causing autoregressive generation to impose an artificial ordering bias and suffer from error accumulation. To address this, we propose scDiVa, a masked discrete diffusion foundation model that aligns generation with the dropout-like corruption process by defining a continuous-time forward masking mechanism in token space. ScDiVa features a bidirectional denoiser that jointly models discrete gene identities and continuous values, utilizing entropy-normalized serialization and a latent anchor token to maximize information efficiency and preserve global cell identity. The model is trained via depth-invariant time sampling and a dual denoising objective to simulate varying sparsity levels while ensuring precise recovery of both identity and magnitude. Pre-trained on 59 million cells, scDiVa achieves strong transfer performance across major benchmarks, including batch integration, cell type annotation, and perturbation response prediction. These results suggest that masked discrete diffusion serves as a biologically coherent and effective alternative to autoregression.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03477v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Routing Collapses: On the Degenerate Convergence of LLM Routers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03478</link><description>arXiv:2602.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM routing aims to achieve a favorable quality--cost trade-off by dynamically assigning easy queries to smaller models and harder queries to stronger ones. However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse. On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17\% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EquiRouter.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03478v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Preferences for Idiomatic Language are Acquired Slowly -- and Forgotten Quickly: A Case Study on Swedish</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03484</link><description>arXiv:2602.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate how language models develop preferences for \textit{idiomatic} as compared to \textit{linguistically acceptable} Swedish, both during pretraining and when adapting a model from English to Swedish. To do so, we train models on Swedish from scratch and by fine-tuning English-pretrained models, probing their preferences at various checkpoints using minimal pairs that differ in linguistic acceptability or idiomaticity. For linguistic acceptability, we adapt existing benchmarks into a minimal-pair format. To assess idiomaticity, we introduce two novel datasets: one contrasting conventionalized idioms with plausible variants, and another contrasting idiomatic Swedish with Translationese. Our findings suggest that idiomatic competence emerges more slowly than other linguistic abilities, including grammatical and lexical correctness. While longer training yields diminishing returns for most tasks, idiom-related performance continues to improve, particularly in the largest model tested (8B). However, instruction tuning on data machine-translated from English -- the common approach for languages with little or no native instruction data -- causes models to rapidly lose their preference for idiomatic language.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03484v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Verification Dilemma: Experience-Driven Suppression of Overused Checking in LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03485</link><description>arXiv:2602.03485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by generating long reasoning traces with reflection. Through a large-scale empirical analysis, we find that a substantial fraction of reflective steps consist of self-verification (recheck) that repeatedly confirm intermediate results. These rechecks occur frequently across models and benchmarks, yet the vast majority are confirmatory rather than corrective, rarely identifying errors and altering reasoning outcomes. This reveals a mismatch between how often self-verification is activated and how often it is actually useful. Motivated by this, we propose a novel, experience-driven test-time framework that reduces the overused verification. Our method detects the activation of recheck behavior, consults an offline experience pool of past verification outcomes, and estimates whether a recheck is likely unnecessary via efficient retrieval. When historical experience suggests unnecessary, a suppression signal redirects the model to proceed. Across multiple model and benchmarks, our approach reduces token usage up to 20.3% while maintaining the accuracy, and in some datasets even yields accuracy improvements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03485v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepDFA: Injecting Temporal Logic in Deep Learning for Sequential Subsymbolic Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03486</link><description>arXiv:2602.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating logical knowledge into deep neural network training is still a hard challenge, especially for sequential or temporally extended domains involving subsymbolic observations. To address this problem, we propose DeepDFA, a neurosymbolic framework that integrates high-level temporal logic - expressed as Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) or Moore Machines - into neural architectures. DeepDFA models temporal rules as continuous, differentiable layers, enabling symbolic knowledge injection into subsymbolic domains. We demonstrate how DeepDFA can be used in two key settings: (i) static image sequence classification, and (ii) policy learning in interactive non-Markovian environments. Across extensive experiments, DeepDFA outperforms traditional deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers) and novel neuro-symbolic systems, achieving state-of-the-art results in temporal knowledge integration. These results highlight the potential of DeepDFA to bridge subsymbolic learning and symbolic reasoning in sequential tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03486v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Detecting and Explaining Malware Family Evolution Using Rule-Based Drift Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03489</link><description>arXiv:2602.03489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware detection and classification into families are critical tasks in cybersecurity, complicated by the continual evolution of malware to evade detection. This evolution introduces concept drift, in which the statistical properties of malware features change over time, reducing the effectiveness of static machine learning models. Understanding and explaining this drift is essential for maintaining robust and trustworthy malware detectors. In this paper, we propose an interpretable approach to concept drift detection. Our method uses a rule-based classifier to generate human-readable descriptions of both original and evolved malware samples belonging to the same malware family. By comparing the resulting rule sets using a similarity function, we can detect and quantify concept drift. Crucially, this comparison also identifies the specific features and feature values that have changed, providing clear explanations of how malware has evolved to bypass detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only accurately detects drift but also provides actionable insights into the behavior of evolving malware families, supporting both detection and threat analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03489v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Minimal Task Reveals Emergent Path Integration and Object-Location Binding in a Predictive Sequence Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03490</link><description>arXiv:2602.03490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive cognition requires structured internal models representing objects and their relations. Predictive neural networks are often proposed to form such "world models", yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One hypothesis is that action-conditioned sequential prediction suffices for learning such world models. In this work, we investigate this possibility in a minimal in-silico setting. Sequentially sampling tokens from 2D continuous token scenes, a recurrent neural network is trained to predict the upcoming token from current input and a saccade-like displacement. On novel scenes, prediction accuracy improves across the sequence, indicating in-context learning. Decoding analyses reveal path integration and dynamic binding of token identity to position. Interventional analyses show that new bindings can be learned late in sequence and that out-of-distribution bindings can be learned. Together, these results demonstrate how structured representations that rely on flexible binding emerge to support prediction, offering a mechanistic account of sequential world modeling relevant to cognitive science.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03490v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoupling Skeleton and Flesh: Efficient Multimodal Table Reasoning with Disentangled Alignment and Structure-aware Guidance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03491</link><description>arXiv:2602.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning over table images remains challenging for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to complex layouts and tightly coupled structure-content information. Existing solutions often depend on expensive supervised training, reinforcement learning, or external tools, limiting efficiency and scalability. This work addresses a key question: how to adapt LVLMs to table reasoning with minimal annotation and no external tools? Specifically, we first introduce DiSCo, a Disentangled Structure-Content alignment framework that explicitly separates structural abstraction from semantic grounding during multimodal alignment, efficiently adapting LVLMs to tables structures. Building on DiSCo, we further present Table-GLS, a Global-to-Local Structure-guided reasoning framework that performs table reasoning via structured exploration and evidence-grounded inference. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework efficiently enhances LVLM's table understanding and reasoning capabilities, particularly generalizing to unseen table structures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03491v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Least but not Last: Fine-tuning Intermediate Principal Components for Better Performance-Forgetting Trade-Offs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03493</link><description>arXiv:2602.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods have emerged as crucial techniques for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks under computational and memory constraints. However, they face a fundamental challenge in balancing task-specific performance gains against catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge, where existing methods provide inconsistent recommendations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance-forgetting trade-offs inherent in low-rank adaptation using principal components as initialization. Our investigation reveals that fine-tuning intermediate components leads to better balance and show more robustness to high learning rates than first (PiSSA) and last (MiLoRA) components in existing work. Building on these findings, we provide a practical approach for initialization of LoRA that offers superior trade-offs. We demonstrate in a thorough empirical study on a variety of computer vision and NLP tasks that our approach improves accuracy and reduces forgetting, also in continual learning scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03493v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DALI: A Workload-Aware Offloading Framework for Efficient MoE Inference on Local PCs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03495</link><description>arXiv:2602.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures significantly enhance the capacity of LLMs without proportional increases in computation, but at the cost of a vast parameter size. Offloading MoE expert parameters to host memory and leveraging both CPU and GPU computation has recently emerged as a promising direction to support such models on resourceconstrained local PC platforms. While promising, we notice that existing approaches mismatch the dynamic nature of expert workloads, which leads to three fundamental inefficiencies: (1) Static expert assignment causes severe CPUGPU load imbalance, underutilizing CPU and GPU resources; (2) Existing prefetching techniques fail to accurately predict high-workload experts, leading to costly inaccurate prefetches; (3) GPU cache policies neglect workload dynamics, resulting in poor hit rates and limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose DALI, a workloaDAware offLoadIng framework for efficient MoE inference on local PCs. To fully utilize hardware resources, DALI first dynamically assigns experts to CPU or GPU by modeling assignment as a 0-1 integer optimization problem and solving it efficiently using a Greedy Assignment strategy at runtime. To improve prefetching accuracy, we develop a Residual-Based Prefetching method leveraging inter-layer residual information to accurately predict high-workload experts. Additionally, we introduce a Workload-Aware Cache Replacement policy that exploits temporal correlation in expert activations to improve GPU cache efficiency. By evaluating across various MoE models and settings, DALI achieves significant speedups in the both prefill and decoding phases over the state-of-the-art offloading frameworks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03495v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lookahead Path Likelihood Optimization for Diffusion LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03496</link><description>arXiv:2602.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) support arbitrary-order generation, yet their inference performance critically depends on the unmasking order. Existing strategies rely on heuristics that greedily optimize local confidence, offering limited guidance for identifying unmasking paths that are globally consistent and accurate. To bridge this gap, we introduce path log-likelihood (Path LL), a trajectory-conditioned objective that strongly correlates with downstream accuracy and enables principled selection of unmasking paths. To optimize Path LL at inference time, we propose POKE, an efficient value estimator that predicts the expected future Path LL of a partial decoding trajectory. We then integrate this lookahead signal into POKE-SMC, a Sequential Monte Carlo-based search framework for dynamically identifying optimal unmasking paths. Extensive experiments across 6 reasoning tasks show that POKE-SMC consistently improves accuracy, achieving 2%--3% average gains over strong decoding-time scaling baselines at comparable inference overhead on LLaDA models and advancing the accuracy--compute Pareto frontier.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03496v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03501</link><description>arXiv:2602.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reparameterization Policy Gradient (RPG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for model-based reinforcement learning, enabling high sample efficiency by backpropagating gradients through differentiable dynamics. However, prior RPG approaches have been predominantly restricted to Gaussian policies, limiting their performance and failing to leverage recent advances in generative models. In this work, we identify that flow policies, which generate actions via differentiable ODE integration, naturally align with the RPG framework, a connection not established in prior work. However, naively exploiting this synergy proves ineffective, often suffering from training instability and a lack of exploration. We propose Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO). RFO computes policy gradients by backpropagating jointly through the flow generation process and system dynamics, unlocking high sample efficiency without requiring intractable log-likelihood calculations. RFO includes two tailored regularization terms for stability and exploration. We also propose a variant of RFO with action chunking. Extensive experiments on diverse locomotion and manipulation tasks, involving both rigid and soft bodies with state or visual inputs, demonstrate the effectiveness of RFO. Notably, on a challenging locomotion task controlling a soft-body quadruped, RFO achieves almost $2\times$ the reward of the state-of-the-art baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03501v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative Decompression: Optimal Lossy Decoding Against Distribution Mismatch</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03505</link><description>arXiv:2602.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses optimal decoding strategies in lossy compression where the assumed distribution for compressor design mismatches the actual (true) distribution of the source. This problem has immediate relevance in standardized communication systems where the decoder acquires side information or priors about the true distribution that are unavailable to the fixed encoder. We formally define the mismatched quantization problem, demonstrating that the optimal reconstruction rule, termed generative decompression, aligns with classical Bayesian estimation by taking the conditional expectation under the true distribution given the quantization indices and adapting it to fixed-encoder constraints. This strategy effectively performs a generative Bayesian correction on the decoder side, strictly outperforming the conventional centroid rule. We extend this framework to transmission over noisy channels, deriving a robust soft-decoding rule that quantifies the inefficiency of standard modular source--channel separation architectures under mismatch. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to task-oriented decoding, showing that the optimal strategy shifts from conditional mean estimation to maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. Experimental results on Gaussian sources and deep-learning-based semantic classification demonstrate that generative decompression closes a vast majority of the performance gap to the ideal joint-optimization benchmark, enabling adaptive, high-fidelity reconstruction without modifying the encoder.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03505v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explaining the Explainer: Understanding the Inner Workings of Transformer-based Symbolic Regression Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03506</link><description>arXiv:2602.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following their success across many domains, transformers have also proven effective for symbolic regression (SR); however, the internal mechanisms underlying their generation of mathematical operators remain largely unexplored. Although mechanistic interpretability has successfully identified circuits in language and vision models, it has not yet been applied to SR. In this article, we introduce PATCHES, an evolutionary circuit discovery algorithm that identifies compact and correct circuits for SR. Using PATCHES, we isolate 28 circuits, providing the first circuit-level characterisation of an SR transformer. We validate these findings through a robust causal evaluation framework based on key notions such as faithfulness, completeness, and minimality. Our analysis shows that mean patching with performance-based evaluation most reliably isolates functionally correct circuits. In contrast, we demonstrate that direct logit attribution and probing classifiers primarily capture correlational features rather than causal ones, limiting their utility for circuit discovery. Overall, these results establish SR as a high-potential application domain for mechanistic interpretability and propose a principled methodology for circuit discovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03506v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Reason Faithfully through Step-Level Faithfulness Maximization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03507</link><description>arXiv:2602.03507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has markedly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, most RLVR pipelines rely on sparse outcome-based rewards, providing little supervision over intermediate steps and thus encouraging over-confidence and spurious reasoning, which in turn increases hallucinations. To address this, we propose FaithRL, a general reinforcement learning framework that directly optimizes reasoning faithfulness. We formalize a faithfulness-maximization objective and theoretically show that optimizing it mitigates over-confidence. To instantiate this objective, we introduce a geometric reward design and a faithfulness-aware advantage modulation mechanism that assigns step-level credit by penalizing unsupported steps while preserving valid partial derivations. Across diverse backbones and benchmarks, FaithRL consistently reduces hallucination rates while maintaining (and often improving) answer correctness. Further analysis confirms that FaithRL increases step-wise reasoning faithfulness and generalizes robustly.

Abstract: Recent DiT-based text-to-image models increasingly adopt LLMs as text encoders, yet text conditioning remains largely static and often utilizes only a single LLM layer, despite pronounced semantic hierarchy across LLM layers and non-stationary denoising dynamics over both diffusion time and network depth. To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion model's generative capability, we introduce a unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text-image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train-inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03510v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CMR: Contractive Mapping Embeddings for Robust Humanoid Locomotion on Unstructured Terrains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03511</link><description>arXiv:2602.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust disturbance rejection remains a longstanding challenge in humanoid locomotion, particularly on unstructured terrains where sensing is unreliable and model mismatch is pronounced. While perception information, such as height map, enhances terrain awareness, sensor noise and sim-to-real gaps can destabilize policies in practice. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis that bounds the return gap under observation noise, when the induced latent dynamics are contractive. Furthermore, we present Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework that maps high-dimensional, disturbance-prone observations into a latent space, where local perturbations are attenuated over time. Specifically, this approach couples contrastive representation learning with Lipschitz regularization to preserve task-relevant geometry while explicitly controlling sensitivity. Notably, the formulation can be incorporated into modern deep reinforcement learning pipelines as an auxiliary loss term with minimal additional technical effort required. Further, our extensive humanoid experiments show that CMR potently outperforms other locomotion algorithms under increased noise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03511v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Function-Space Stability Boundary for Generalization in Interpolating Learning Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03514</link><description>arXiv:2602.03514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern learning systems often interpolate training data while still generalizing well, yet it remains unclear when algorithmic stability explains this behavior. We model training as a function-space trajectory and measure sensitivity to single-sample perturbations along this trajectory.
  We propose a contractive propagation condition and a stability certificate obtained by unrolling the resulting recursion. A small certificate implies stability-based generalization, while we also prove that there exist interpolating regimes with small risk where such contractive sensitivity cannot hold, showing that stability is not a universal explanation.
  Experiments confirm that certificate growth predicts generalization differences across optimizers, step sizes, and dataset perturbations. The framework therefore identifies regimes where stability explains generalization and where alternative mechanisms must account for success.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03514v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Staleness in Asynchronous Pipeline Parallelism via Basis Rotation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03515</link><description>arXiv:2602.03515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03515v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Not All Negative Samples Are Equal: LLMs Learn Better from Plausible Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03516</link><description>arXiv:2602.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from negative samples holds great promise for improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capability, yet existing methods treat all incorrect responses as equally informative, overlooking the crucial role of sample quality. To address this, we propose Plausible Negative Samples (PNS), a method that synthesizes high-quality negative samples exhibiting expected format and structural coherence while ultimately yielding incorrect answers. PNS trains a dedicated model via reverse reinforcement learning (RL) guided by a composite reward combining format compliance, accuracy inversion, reward model assessment, and chain-of-thought evaluation, generating responses nearly indistinguishable from correct solutions. We further validate PNS as a plug-and-play data source for preference optimization across three backbone models on seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Results demonstrate that PNS consistently outperforms other negative sample synthesis methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.03% over RL-trained models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03516v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rank-Learner: Orthogonal Ranking of Treatment Effects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03517</link><description>arXiv:2602.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many decision-making problems require ranking individuals by their treatment effects rather than estimating the exact effect magnitudes. Examples include prioritizing patients for preventive care interventions, or ranking customers by the expected incremental impact of an advertisement. Surprisingly, while causal effect estimation has received substantial attention in the literature, the problem of directly learning rankings of treatment effects has largely remained unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Rank-Learner, a novel two-stage learner that directly learns the ranking of treatment effects from observational data. We first show that naive approaches based on precise treatment effect estimation solve a harder problem than necessary for ranking, while our Rank-Learner optimizes a pairwise learning objective that recovers the true treatment effect ordering, without explicit CATE estimation. We further show that our Rank-Learner is Neyman-orthogonal and thus comes with strong theoretical guarantees, including robustness to estimation errors in the nuisance functions. In addition, our Rank-Learner is model-agnostic, and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments where Rank-Learner consistently outperforms standard CATE estimators and non-orthogonal ranking methods. Overall, we provide practitioners with a new, orthogonal two-stage learner for ranking individuals by their treatment effects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03517v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Live or Lie: Action-Aware Capsule Multiple Instance Learning for Risk Assessment in Live Streaming Platforms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03520</link><description>arXiv:2602.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Live streaming has become a cornerstone of today's internet, enabling massive real-time social interactions. However, it faces severe risks arising from sparse, coordinated malicious behaviors among multiple participants, which are often concealed within normal activities and challenging to detect timely and accurately. In this work, we provide a pioneering study on risk assessment in live streaming rooms, characterized by weak supervision where only room-level labels are available. We formulate the task as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, treating each room as a bag and defining structured user-timeslot capsules as instances. These capsules represent subsequences of user actions within specific time windows, encapsulating localized behavioral patterns. Based on this formulation, we propose AC-MIL, an Action-aware Capsule MIL framework that models both individual behaviors and group-level coordination patterns. AC-MIL captures multi-granular semantics and behavioral cues through a serial and parallel architecture that jointly encodes temporal dynamics and cross-user dependencies. These signals are integrated for robust room-level risk prediction, while also offering interpretable evidence at the behavior segment level. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets from Douyin demonstrate that AC-MIL significantly outperforms MIL and sequential baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in room-level risk assessment for live streaming. Moreover, AC-MIL provides capsule-level interpretability, enabling identification of risky behavior segments as actionable evidence for intervention.

Abstract: The last mile of the distribution grid is crucial for a successful energy transition, as more low-carbon technology like photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, and electric vehicle chargers connect to the low-voltage grid. Despite considerable challenges in operation and planning, researchers often lack access to suitable low-voltage grid data. To address this, we present the FeederBW dataset with data recorded by the German distribution system operator Netze BW. It offers real-world energy data from 200 low-voltage feeders over two years (2023-2025) with weather information and detailed metadata, including changes in low-carbon technology installations. The dataset includes feeder-specific details such as the number of housing units, installed power of low-carbon technology, and aggregated industrial energy data. Furthermore, high photovoltaic feed-in and one-minute temporal resolution makes the dataset unique. FeederBW supports various applications, including machine learning for load forecasting, conducting non-intrusive load monitoring, generating synthetic data, and analyzing the interplay between weather, feeder measurements, and metadata. The dataset reveals insightful patterns and clearly reflects the growing impact of low-carbon technology on low-voltage grids.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03521v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] D3PIA: A Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model for Piano Accompaniment Generation From Lead sheet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03523</link><description>arXiv:2602.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating piano accompaniments in the symbolic music domain is a challenging task that requires producing a complete piece of piano music from given melody and chord constraints, such as those provided by a lead sheet. In this paper, we propose a discrete diffusion-based piano accompaniment generation model, D3PIA, leveraging local alignment between lead sheet and accompaniment in piano-roll representation. D3PIA incorporates Neighborhood Attention (NA) to both encode the lead sheet and condition it for predicting note states in the piano accompaniment. This design enhances local contextual modeling by efficiently attending to nearby melody and chord conditions. We evaluate our model using the POP909 dataset, a widely used benchmark for piano accompaniment generation. Objective evaluation results demonstrate that D3PIA preserves chord conditions more faithfully compared to continuous diffusion-based and Transformer-based baselines. Furthermore, a subjective listening test indicates that D3PIA generates more musically coherent accompaniments than the comparison models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03523v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ZOR filters: fast and smaller than fuse filters</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03525</link><description>arXiv:2602.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic membership filters support fast approximate membership queries with a controlled false-positive probability $\varepsilon$ and are widely used across storage, analytics, networking, and bioinformatics \cite{chang2008bigtable,dayan2018optimalbloom,broder2004network,harris2020improved,marchet2023scalable,chikhi2025logan,hernandez2025reindeer2}. In the static setting, state-of-the-art designs such as XOR and fuse filters achieve low overhead and very fast queries, but their peeling-based construction succeeds only with high probability, which complicates deterministic builds \cite{graf2020xor,graf2022binary,ulrich2023taxor}.
  We introduce \emph{ZOR filters}, a deterministic continuation of XOR/fuse filters that guarantees construction termination while preserving the same XOR-based query mechanism. ZOR replaces restart-on-failure with deterministic peeling that abandons a small fraction of keys, and restores false-positive-only semantics by storing the remainder in a compact auxiliary structure. In our experiments, the abandoned fraction drops below $1\%$ for moderate arity (e.g., $N\ge 5$), so the auxiliary handles a negligible fraction of keys. As a result, ZOR filters can achieve overhead within $1\%$ of the information-theoretic lower bound $\log_2(1/\varepsilon)$ while retaining fuse-like query performance; the additional cost is concentrated on negative queries due to the auxiliary check. Our current prototype builds several-fold slower than highly optimized fuse builders because it maintains explicit incidence information during deterministic peeling; closing this optimisation gap is an engineering target.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03525v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WARP Logic Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03527</link><description>arXiv:2602.03527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and efficient AI inference is increasingly important, and recent models that directly learn low-level logic operations have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, existing logic neural networks incur high training costs, introduce redundancy or rely on approximate gradients, which limits scalability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WAlsh Relaxation for Probabilistic (WARP) logic neural networks -- a novel gradient-based framework that efficiently learns combinations of hardware-native logic blocks. We show that WARP yields the most parameter-efficient representation for exactly learning Boolean functions and that several prior approaches arise as restricted special cases. Training is improved by introducing learnable thresholding and residual initialization, while we bridge the gap between relaxed training and discrete logic inference through stochastic smoothing. Experiments demonstrate faster convergence than state-of-the-art baselines, while scaling effectively to deeper architectures and logic functions with higher input arity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Morphe: High-Fidelity Generative Video Streaming with Vision Foundation Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03529</link><description>arXiv:2602.03529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video streaming is a fundamental Internet service, while the quality still cannot be guaranteed especially in poor network conditions such as bandwidth-constrained and remote areas. Existing works mainly work towards two directions: traditional pixel-codec streaming nearly approaches its limit and is hard to step further in compression; the emerging neural-enhanced or generative streaming usually fall short in latency and visual fidelity, hindering their practical deployment. Inspired by the recent success of vision foundation model (VFM), we strive to harness the powerful video understanding and processing capacities of VFM to achieve generalization, high fidelity and loss resilience for real-time video streaming with even higher compression rate. We present the first revolutionized paradigm that enables VFM-based end-to-end generative video streaming towards this goal. Specifically, Morphe employs joint training of visual tokenizers and variable-resolution spatiotemporal optimization under simulated network constraints. Additionally, a robust streaming system is constructed that leverages intelligent packet dropping to resist real-world network perturbations. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that Morphe achieves comparable visual quality while saving 62.5\% bandwidth compared to H.265, and accomplishes real-time, loss-resilient video delivery in challenging network environments, representing a milestone in VFM-enabled multimedia streaming solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03529v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpretable Logical Anomaly Classification via Constraint Decomposition and Instruction Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03530</link><description>arXiv:2602.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logical anomalies are violations of predefined constraints on object quantity, spatial layout, and compositional relationships in industrial images. While prior work largely treats anomaly detection as a binary decision, such formulations cannot indicate which logical rule is broken and therefore offer limited value for quality assurance. We introduce Logical Anomaly Classification (LAC), a task that unifies anomaly detection and fine-grained violation classification in a single inference step. To tackle LAC, we propose LogiCls, a vision-language framework that decomposes complex logical constraints into a sequence of verifiable subqueries. We further present a data-centric instruction synthesis pipeline that generates chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision for these subqueries, coupling precise grounding annotations with diverse image-text augmentations to adapt vision language models (VLMs) to logic-sensitive reasoning. Training is stabilized by a difficulty-aware resampling strategy that emphasizes challenging subqueries and long tail constraint types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogiCls delivers robust, interpretable, and accurate industrial logical anomaly classification, providing both the predicted violation categories and their evidence trails.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03530v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Representation Learning in Masked Autoencoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03531</link><description>arXiv:2602.03531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) achieve impressive performance in image classification tasks, yet the internal representations they learn remain less understood. This work started as an attempt to understand the strong downstream classification performance of MAE. In this process we discover that representations learned with the pretraining and fine-tuning, are quite robust - demonstrating a good classification performance in the presence of degradations, such as blur and occlusions. Through layer-wise analysis of token embeddings, we show that pretrained MAE progressively constructs its latent space in a class-aware manner across network depth: embeddings from different classes lie in subspaces that become increasingly separable. We further observe that MAE exhibits early and persistent global attention across encoder layers, in contrast to standard Vision Transformers (ViTs). To quantify feature robustness, we introduce two sensitivity indicators: directional alignment between clean and perturbed embeddings, and head-wise retention of active features under degradations. These studies help establish the robust classification performance of MAEs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03531v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PnP-U3D: Plug-and-Play 3D Framework Bridging Autoregression and Diffusion for Unified Understanding and Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03533</link><description>arXiv:2602.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of large multimodal models has inspired efforts toward unified frameworks that couple understanding and generation. While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation. A lightweight transformer bridges the feature space of large language models and the conditional space of 3D diffusion models, enabling effective cross-modal information exchange while preserving the priors learned by standalone models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D understanding and generation benchmarks, while also excelling in 3D editing tasks. These results highlight the potential of unified AR+diffusion models as a promising direction for building more general-purpose 3D intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03533v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparse Training of Neural Networks based on Multilevel Mirror Descent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03535</link><description>arXiv:2602.03535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic sparse training algorithm based on linearized Bregman iterations / mirror descent that exploits the naturally incurred sparsity by alternating between periods of static and dynamic sparsity pattern updates. The key idea is to combine sparsity-inducing Bregman iterations with adaptive freezing of the network structure to enable efficient exploration of the sparse parameter space while maintaining sparsity. We provide convergence guaranties by embedding our method in a multilevel optimization framework. Furthermore, we empirically show that our algorithm can produce highly sparse and accurate models on standard benchmarks. We also show that the theoretical number of FLOPs compared to SGD training can be reduced from 38% for standard Bregman iterations to 6% for our method while maintaining test accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MatGPTQ: Accurate and Efficient Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03537</link><description>arXiv:2602.03537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant) is a recent quantization approach showing that a single integer-quantized model can be served across multiple precisions, by slicing the most significant bits (MSB) at inference time. This enables a single checkpoint to cover a wide range of memory and latency budgets, but renders quantization much more challenging. In particular, the initial MatQuant relies on expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) variants, rather than fast one-shot post training quantization (PTQ), and lacks open-source and kernel support. We address all of these limitations by introducing Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization (MatGPTQ), a new PTQ pipeline that produces a single parent model jointly optimized for multiple target precisions in one-shot, based on a small calibration set. MatGPTQ casts Matryoshka quantization as a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation, resulting in an algorithm that produces a multi-bit-width, "sliceable" model in a single pass. We also incorporate a new budget-aware search for heterogeneous per-layer bit-witdhs and provide efficient kernels that implement slicing and mixed-precision execution. Across standard LLMs and benchmarks, MatGPTQ preserves high-bit accuracy while substantially improving performance at low-bit-witdh settings. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for Matryoshka-style post-training quantization and make single-checkpoint, multi-precision deployment open and practical.

Abstract: While Dynamic Gaussian Splatting enables high-fidelity 4D reconstruction, its deployment is severely hindered by a fundamental dilemma: unconstrained densification leads to excessive memory consumption incompatible with edge devices, whereas heuristic pruning fails to achieve optimal rendering quality under preset Gaussian budgets. In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error &lt; 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDGS delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits, achieving over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03538v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Group Selection as a Safeguard Against AI Substitution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03541</link><description>arXiv:2602.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliance on generative AI can reduce cultural variance and diversity, especially in creative work. This reduction in variance has already led to problems in model performance, including model collapse and hallucination. In this paper, we examine the long-term consequences of AI use for human cultural evolution and the conditions under which widespread AI use may lead to "cultural collapse", a process in which reliance on AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation and slows cumulative cultural evolution. Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong. Overall, our findings shed light on the long-term, population-level effects of AI adoption and inform policy and organizational strategies to mitigate these risks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03541v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can Large Language Models Generalize Procedures Across Representations?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03542</link><description>arXiv:2602.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained and tested extensively on symbolic representations such as code and graphs, yet real-world user tasks are often specified in natural language. To what extent can LLMs generalize across these representations? Here, we approach this question by studying isomorphic tasks involving procedures represented in code, graphs, and natural language (e.g., scheduling steps in planning). We find that training LLMs with popular post-training methods on graphs or code data alone does not reliably generalize to corresponding natural language tasks, while training solely on natural language can lead to inefficient performance gains. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage data curriculum that first trains on symbolic, then natural language data. The curriculum substantially improves model performance across model families and tasks. Remarkably, a 1.5B Qwen model trained by our method can closely match zero-shot GPT-4o in naturalistic planning. Finally, our analysis suggests that successful cross-representation generalization can be interpreted as a form of generative analogy, which our curriculum effectively encourages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03542v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sequential Linear Contracts on Matroids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03543</link><description>arXiv:2602.03543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study sequential contracts under matroid constraints. In the sequential setting, an agent can take actions one by one. After each action, the agent observes the stochastic value of the action and then decides which action to take next, if any. At the end, the agent decides what subset of taken actions to use for the principal's reward; and the principal receives the total value of this subset as a reward. Taking each action induces a certain cost for the agent. Thus, to motivate the agent to take actions the principal is expected to offer an appropriate contract. A contract describes the payment from the principal to the agent as a function of the principal's reward obtained through the agent's actions. In this work, we concentrate on studying linear contracts, i.e.\ the contracts where the principal transfers a fraction of their total reward to the agent. We assume that the total principal's reward is calculated based on a subset of actions that forms an independent set in a given matroid. We establish a relationship between the problem of finding an optimal linear contract (or computing the corresponding principal's utility) and the so called matroid (un)reliability problem. Generally, the above problems turn out to be equivalent subject to adding parallel copies of elements to the given matroid.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03543v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Investigating the Influence of Spatial Ability in Augmented Reality-assisted Robot Programming</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03544</link><description>arXiv:2602.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) offers promising opportunities to enhance learning, but its mechanisms and effects are not yet fully understood. As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience. In the AR condition, these relationships were not observable, suggesting that AR mitigated the disadvantage typically experienced by learners with lower spatial abilities. These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics. Future research should further explore this compensatory role of AR to guide the design of personalized learning environments that address diverse learner needs and reduce barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Persona Generators: Generating Diverse Synthetic Personas at Scale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03545</link><description>arXiv:2602.03545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating AI systems that interact with humans requires understanding their behavior across diverse user populations, but collecting representative human data is often expensive or infeasible, particularly for novel technologies or hypothetical future scenarios. Recent work in Generative Agent-Based Modeling has shown that large language models can simulate human-like synthetic personas with high fidelity, accurately reproducing the beliefs and behaviors of specific individuals. However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes. We demonstrate that evolved generators substantially outperform existing baselines across six diversity metrics on held-out contexts, producing populations that span rare trait combinations difficult to achieve in standard LLM outputs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03545v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03546</link><description>arXiv:2602.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03546v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AffordanceGrasp-R1:Leveraging Reasoning-Based Affordance Segmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Grasping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03547</link><description>arXiv:2602.03547v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in open-domain dialogues. However, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in service dialogues, as they rely on noisy, low-quality human conversation data. This limitation arises from data scarcity and the difficulty of simulating authentic, goal-oriented user behaviors. To address these issues, we propose SEAD (Self-Evolving Agent for Service Dialogue), a framework that enables agents to learn effective strategies without large-scale human annotations. SEAD decouples user modeling into two components: a Profile Controller that generates diverse user states to manage training curriculum, and a User Role-play Model that focuses on realistic role-playing. This design ensures the environment provides adaptive training scenarios rather than acting as an unfair adversary. Experiments demonstrate that SEAD significantly outperforms Open-source Foundation Models and Closed-source Commercial Models, improving task completion rate by 17.6% and dialogue efficiency by 11.1%.

Abstract: Respiratory rate (RR) is a key vital sign for clinical assessment and mental well-being, yet it is rarely monitored in everyday life due to the lack of unobtrusive sensing technologies. In-ear audio sensing is promising due to its high social acceptance and the amplification of physiological sounds caused by the occlusion effect; however, existing approaches often fail under real-world noise or rely on computationally expensive models. We present EarResp-ANS, the first system enabling fully on-device, real-time RR estimation on commercial earphones. The system employs LMS-based adaptive noise suppression (ANS) to attenuate ambient noise while preserving respiration-related acoustic components, without requiring neural networks or audio streaming, thereby explicitly addressing the energy and privacy constraints of wearable devices. We evaluate EarResp-ANS in a study with 18 participants under realistic acoustic conditions, including music, cafeteria noise, and white noise up to 80 dB SPL. EarResp-ANS achieves robust performance with a global MAE of 0.84 CPM , reduced to 0.47 CPM via automatic outlier rejection, while operating with less than 2% processor load directly on the earphone.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03549v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Formal Evidence Generation for Assurance Cases for Robotic Software Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03550</link><description>arXiv:2602.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotics and Autonomous Systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, so that demonstrating their safety is essential. Assurance Cases (ACs) provide structured arguments supported by evidence, but generating and maintaining this evidence is labour-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to keep consistent as systems evolve. We present a model-based approach to systematically generating AC evidence by embedding formal verification into the assurance workflow. The approach addresses three challenges: systematically deriving formal assertions from natural language requirements using templates, orchestrating multiple formal verification tools to handle diverse property types, and integrating formal evidence production into the workflow. Leveraging RoboChart, a domain-specific modelling language with formal semantics, we combine model checking and theorem proving in our approach. Structured requirements are automatically transformed into formal assertions using predefined templates, and verification results are automatically integrated as evidence. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03550v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Assessing the Impact of Typological Features on Multilingual Machine Translation in the Age of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03551</link><description>arXiv:2602.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite major advances in multilingual modeling, large quality disparities persist across languages. Besides the obvious impact of uneven training resources, typological properties have also been proposed to determine the intrinsic difficulty of modeling a language. The existing evidence, however, is mostly based on small monolingual language models or bilingual translation models trained from scratch. We expand on this line of work by analyzing two large pre-trained multilingual translation models, NLLB-200 and Tower+, which are state-of-the-art representatives of encoder-decoder and decoder-only machine translation, respectively. Based on a broad set of languages, we find that target language typology drives translation quality of both models, even after controlling for more trivial factors, such as data resourcedness and writing script. Additionally, languages with certain typological properties benefit more from a wider search of the output space, suggesting that such languages could profit from alternative decoding strategies beyond the standard left-to-right beam search. To facilitate further research in this area, we release a set of fine-grained typological properties for 212 languages of the FLORES+ MT evaluation benchmark.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03551v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Single Answer Is Not Enough: Rethinking Single-Step Retrosynthesis Benchmarks for LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03554</link><description>arXiv:2602.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress has expanded the use of large language models (LLMs) in drug discovery, including synthesis planning. However, objective evaluation of retrosynthesis performance remains limited. Existing benchmarks and metrics typically rely on published synthetic procedures and Top-K accuracy based on single ground-truth, which does not capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis planning. We propose a new benchmarking framework for single-step retrosynthesis that evaluates both general-purpose and chemistry-specialized LLMs using ChemCensor, a novel metric for chemical plausibility. By emphasizing plausibility over exact match, this approach better aligns with human synthesis planning practices. We also introduce CREED, a novel dataset comprising millions of ChemCensor-validated reaction records for LLM training, and use it to train a model that improves over the LLM baselines under this benchmark.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03554v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cut to the Mix: Simple Data Augmentation Outperforms Elaborate Ones in Limited Organ Segmentation Datasets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03555</link><description>arXiv:2602.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a widely applied clinical routine and automated organ segmentation tools dramatically improve the pipeline of the radiologists. Recently, deep learning (DL) based segmentation models have shown the capacity to accomplish such a task. However, the training of the segmentation networks requires large amount of data with manual annotations, which is a major concern due to the data scarcity from clinic. Working with limited data is still common for researches on novel imaging modalities. To enhance the effectiveness of DL models trained with limited data, data augmentation (DA) is a crucial regularization technique. Traditional DA (TDA) strategies focus on basic intra-image operations, i.e. generating images with different orientations and intensity distributions. In contrast, the interimage and object-level DA operations are able to create new images from separate individuals. However, such DA strategies are not well explored on the task of multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we investigated four possible inter-image DA strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug and AnatoMix, on two organ segmentation datasets. The result shows that CutMix, CarveMix and AnatoMix can improve the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0 and 1.9, compared with the state-of-the-art nnUNet without DA strategies. These results can be further improved by adding TDA strategies. It is revealed in our experiments that Cut-Mix is a robust but simple DA strategy to drive up the segmentation performance for multi-organ segmentation, even when CutMix produces intuitively 'wrong' images. Our implementation is publicly available for future benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03555v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Flaky Tests in a Large Industrial Database Management System: An Empirical Study of Fixed Issue Reports for SAP HANA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03556</link><description>arXiv:2602.03556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flaky tests yield different results when executed multiple times for the same version of the source code. Thus, they provide an ambiguous signal about the quality of the code and interfere with the automated assessment of code changes. While a variety of factors can cause test flakiness, approaches to fix flaky tests are typically tailored to address specific causes. However, the prevalent root causes of flaky tests can vary depending on the programming language, application domain, or size of the software project. Since manually labeling flaky tests is time-consuming and tedious, this work proposes an LLMs-as-annotators approach that leverages intra- and inter-model consistency to label issue reports related to fixed flakiness issues with the relevant root cause category. This allows us to gain an overview of prevalent flakiness categories in the issue reports. We evaluated our labeling approach in the context of SAP HANA, a large industrial database management system. Our results suggest that SAP HANA's tests most commonly suffer from issues related to concurrency (23%, 130 of 559 analyzed issue reports). Moreover, our results suggest that different test types face different flakiness challenges. Therefore, we encourage future research on flakiness mitigation to consider evaluating the generalizability of proposed approaches across different test types.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03556v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Test-Driven Code Generation from Functions to Classes: An Empirical Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03557</link><description>arXiv:2602.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-driven development (TDD) has been adopted to improve Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation by using tests as executable specifications. However, existing TDD-style code generation studies are largely limited to function-level tasks, leaving class-level synthesis where multiple methods interact through shared state and call dependencies underexplored. In this paper, we scale test-driven code generation from functions to classes via an iterative TDD framework. Our approach first analyzes intra-class method dependencies to derive a feasible generation schedule, and then incrementally implements each method under method-level public tests with reflection-style execution feedback and bounded repair iterations. To support test-driven generation and rigorous class-level evaluation, we construct ClassEval-TDD, a cleaned and standardized variant of ClassEval with consistent specifications, deterministic test environments, and complete method-level public tests. We conduct an empirical study across eight LLMs and compare against the strongest direct-generation baseline (the best of holistic, incremental, and compositional strategies). Our class-level TDD framework consistently improves class-level correctness by 12 to 26 absolute points and achieves up to 71% fully correct classes, while requiring only a small number of repairs on average. These results demonstrate that test-driven generation can effectively scale beyond isolated functions and substantially improve class-level code generation reliability.

Abstract: Generative text-to-image models are advancing at an unprecedented pace, continuously shifting the perceptual quality ceiling and rendering previously collected labels unreliable for newer generations. To address this, we present ELIQ, a Label-free Framework for Quality Assessment of Evolving AI-generated Images. Specifically, ELIQ focuses on visual quality and prompt-image alignment, automatically constructs positive and aspect-specific negative pairs to cover both conventional distortions and AIGC-specific distortion modes, enabling transferable supervision without human annotations. Building on these pairs, ELIQ adapts a pre-trained multimodal model into a quality-aware critic via instruction tuning and predicts two-dimensional quality using lightweight gated fusion and a Quality Query Transformer. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ELIQ consistently outperforms existing label-free methods, generalizes from AI-generated content (AIGC) to user-generated content (UGC) scenarios without modification, and paves the way for scalable and label-free quality assessment under continuously evolving generative models. The code will be released upon publication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03558v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HySparse: A Hybrid Sparse Attention Architecture with Oracle Token Selection and KV Cache Sharing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03560</link><description>arXiv:2602.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces Hybrid Sparse Attention (HySparse), a new architecture that interleaves each full attention layer with several sparse attention layers. While conceptually simple, HySparse strategically derives each sparse layer's token selection and KV caches directly from the preceding full attention layer. This architecture resolves two fundamental limitations of prior sparse attention methods. First, conventional approaches typically rely on additional proxies to predict token importance, introducing extra complexity and potentially suboptimal performance. In contrast, HySparse uses the full attention layer as a precise oracle to identify important tokens. Second, existing sparse attention designs often reduce computation without saving KV cache. HySparse enables sparse attention layers to reuse the full attention KV cache, thereby reducing both computation and memory. We evaluate HySparse on both 7B dense and 80B MoE models. Across all settings, HySparse consistently outperforms both full attention and hybrid SWA baselines. Notably, in the 80B MoE model with 49 total layers, only 5 layers employ full attention, yet HySparse achieves substantial performance gains while reducing KV cache storage by nearly 10x.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03560v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ACL: Aligned Contrastive Learning Improves BERT and Multi-exit BERT Fine-tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03563</link><description>arXiv:2602.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its success in self-supervised learning, contrastive learning is less studied in the supervised setting. In this work, we first use a set of pilot experiments to show that in the supervised setting, the cross-entropy loss objective (CE) and the contrastive learning objective often conflict with each other, thus hindering the applications of CL in supervised settings. To resolve this problem, we introduce a novel \underline{A}ligned \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{L}earning (ACL) framework. First, ACL-Embed regards label embeddings as extra augmented samples with different labels and employs contrastive learning to align the label embeddings with its samples' representations. Second, to facilitate the optimization of ACL-Embed objective combined with the CE loss, we propose ACL-Grad, which will discard the ACL-Embed term if the two objectives are in conflict. To further enhance the performances of intermediate exits of multi-exit BERT, we further propose cross-layer ACL (ACL-CL), which is to ask the teacher exit to guide the optimization of student shallow exits. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark results in the following takeaways: (a) ACL-BRT outperforms or performs comparably with CE and CE+SCL on the GLUE tasks; (b) ACL, especially CL-ACL, significantly surpasses the baseline methods on the fine-tuning of multi-exit BERT, thus providing better quality-speed tradeoffs for low-latency applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03563v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoGenCast: A Coupled Autoregressive-Flow Generative Framework for Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03564</link><description>arXiv:2602.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting can be viewed as a generative problem that requires both semantic understanding over contextual conditions and stochastic modeling of continuous temporal dynamics. Existing approaches typically rely on either autoregressive large language models (LLMs) for semantic context modeling or diffusion-like models for continuous probabilistic generation. However, neither method alone can adequately model both aspects simultaneously. In this work, we propose CoGenCast, a hybrid generative framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism for effective time series forecasting. Specifically, we reconfigure pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting encoder-decoder backbone by modifying only the attention topology, enabling bidirectional context encoding and causal representation generation. Building on this, a flow-matching mechanism is further integrated to model temporal evolution, capturing continuous stochastic dynamics conditioned on the autoregressively generated representation. Notably, CoGenCast naturally supports multimodal forecasting and cross-domain unified training. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that CoGenCast consistently outperforms previous compared baselines.

Abstract: Model checking is a powerful technique for software verification. However, the approach notably suffers from the infamous state space explosion problem. To tackle this, in this paper, we introduce a novel symbolic method for encoding Petri net markings. It is based on the use of generalised intervals on vectors, as opposed to existing methods based on vectors of intervals such as Interval Decision Diagrams. We develop a formalisation of these intervals, show that they possess homomorphic operations for model checking CTL on Petri nets, and define a canonical form that provides good performance characteristics. Our structure facilitates the symbolic evaluation of CTL formulas in the realm of global model checking, which aims to identify every state that satisfies a formula. Tests on examples of the model checking contest (MCC 2022) show that our approach yields promising results. To achieve this, we implement efficient computations based on saturation and clustering principles derived from other symbolic model checking techniques.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03565v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Riemannian Neural Optimal Transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03566</link><description>arXiv:2602.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational optimal transport (OT) offers a principled framework for generative modeling. Neural OT methods, which use neural networks to learn an OT map (or potential) from data in an amortized way, can be evaluated out of sample after training, but existing approaches are tailored to Euclidean geometry. Extending neural OT to high-dimensional Riemannian manifolds remains an open challenge. In this paper, we prove that any method for OT on manifolds that produces discrete approximations of transport maps necessarily suffers from the curse of dimensionality: achieving a fixed accuracy requires a number of parameters that grows exponentially with the manifold dimension. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce Riemannian Neural OT (RNOT) maps, which are continuous neural-network parameterizations of OT maps on manifolds that avoid discretization and incorporate geometric structure by construction. Under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that RNOT maps approximate Riemannian OT maps with sub-exponential complexity in the dimension. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved scalability and competitive performance relative to discretization-based baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03566v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EVE: Efficient Verification of Data Erasure through Customized Perturbation in Approximate Unlearning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03567</link><description>arXiv:2602.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying whether the machine unlearning process has been properly executed is critical but remains underexplored. Some existing approaches propose unlearning verification methods based on backdooring techniques. However, these methods typically require participation in the model's initial training phase to backdoor the model for later verification, which is inefficient and impractical. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification of erasure method (EVE) for verifying machine unlearning without requiring involvement in the model's initial training process. The core idea is to perturb the unlearning data to ensure the model prediction of the specified samples will change before and after unlearning with perturbed data. The unlearning users can leverage the observation of the changes as a verification signal. Specifically, the perturbations are designed with two key objectives: ensuring the unlearning effect and altering the unlearned model's prediction of target samples. We formalize the perturbation generation as an adversarial optimization problem, solving it by aligning the unlearning gradient with the gradient of boundary change for target samples. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that EVE can verify machine unlearning without involving the model's initial training process, unlike backdoor-based methods. Moreover, EVE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning verification methods, offering significant speedup in efficiency while enhancing verification accuracy. The source code of EVE is released at \uline{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EVE-C143}, providing a novel tool for verification of machine unlearning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03567v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EHRWorld: A Patient-Centric Medical World Model for Long-Horizon Clinical Trajectories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03569</link><description>arXiv:2602.03569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World models offer a principled framework for simulating future states under interventions, but realizing such models in complex, high-stakes domains like medicine remains challenging. Recent large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on static medical reasoning tasks, raising the question of whether they can function as dynamic medical world models capable of simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time. In this work, we show that LLMs only incorporating medical knowledge struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical simulation. To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency, highlighting the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03569v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring for Audio-Visual Joint Representation: Resolving Information Allocation Ambiguity for Robust Cross-Modal Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03570</link><description>arXiv:2602.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual joint representation learning under Cross-Modal Generalization (CMG) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source modality to an unlabeled target modality through a unified discrete representation space. Existing symmetric frameworks often suffer from information allocation ambiguity, where the absence of structural inductive bias leads to semantic-specific leakage across modalities. We propose Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA), which enforces directional information allocation by designating a structured semantic anchor within a shared hierarchy. In our instantiation, we exploit the hierarchical discrete representations induced by audio Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to guide video feature distillation into a shared semantic space. To ensure representational purity, we replace fragile mutual information estimators with a GRL-based adversarial decoupler that explicitly suppresses semantic leakage in modality-specific branches, and introduce Local Sliding Alignment (LSA) to encourage fine-grained temporal alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on AVE and AVVP benchmarks demonstrate that AHA consistently outperforms symmetric baselines in cross-modal transfer. Additional analyses on talking-face disentanglement experiment further validate that the learned representations exhibit improved semantic consistency and disentanglement, indicating the broader applicability of the proposed framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03570v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Use Graph When It Needs: Efficiently and Adaptively Integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03578</link><description>arXiv:2602.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external corpora, its effectiveness is limited by fragmented information in unstructured domain documents. Graph-augmented RAG (GraphRAG) emerged to enhance contextual reasoning through structured knowledge graphs, yet paradoxically underperforms vanilla RAG in real-world scenarios, exhibiting significant accuracy drops and prohibitive latency despite gains on complex queries. We identify the rigid application of GraphRAG to all queries, regardless of complexity, as the root cause. To resolve this, we propose an efficient and adaptive GraphRAG framework called EA-GraphRAG that dynamically integrates RAG and GraphRAG paradigms through syntax-aware complexity analysis. Our approach introduces: (i) a syntactic feature constructor that parses each query and extracts a set of structural features; (ii) a lightweight complexity scorer that maps these features to a continuous complexity score; and (iii) a score-driven routing policy that selects dense RAG for low-score queries, invokes graph-based retrieval for high-score queries, and applies complexity-aware reciprocal rank fusion to handle borderline cases. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark, consisting of two single-hop and two multi-hop QA benchmarks, demonstrate that our EA-GraphRAG significantly improves accuracy, reduces latency, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling mixed scenarios involving both simple and complex queries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03578v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Don't believe everything you read: Understanding and Measuring MCP Behavior under Misleading Tool Descriptions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03580</link><description>arXiv:2602.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables large language models to invoke external tools through natural-language descriptions, forming the foundation of many AI agent applications. However, MCP does not enforce consistency between documented tool behavior and actual code execution, even though MCP Servers often run with broad system privileges. This gap introduces a largely unexplored security risk. We study how mismatches between externally presented tool descriptions and underlying implementations systematically shape the mental models and decision-making behavior of intelligent agents. Specifically, we present the first large-scale study of description-code inconsistency in the MCP ecosystem. We design an automated static analysis framework and apply it to 10,240 real-world MCP Servers across 36 categories. Our results show that while most servers are highly consistent, approximately 13% exhibit substantial mismatches that can enable undocumented privileged operations, hidden state mutations, or unauthorized financial actions. We further observe systematic differences across application categories, popularity levels, and MCP marketplaces. Our findings demonstrate that description-code inconsistency is a concrete and prevalent attack surface in MCP-based AI agents, and motivate the need for systematic auditing and stronger transparency guarantees in future agent ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03580v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimization and Generation in Aerodynamics Inverse Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03582</link><description>arXiv:2602.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design with physics-based objectives is challenging because it couples high-dimensional geometry with expensive simulations, as exemplified by aerodynamic shape optimization for drag reduction. We revisit inverse design through two canonical solutions, the optimal design point and the optimal design distribution, and relate them to optimization and guided generation. Building on this view, we propose a new training loss for cost predictors and a density-gradient optimization method that improves objectives while preserving plausible shapes. We further unify existing training-free guided generation methods. To address their inability to approximate conditional covariance in high dimensions, we develop a time- and memory-efficient algorithm for approximate covariance estimation. Experiments on a controlled 2D study and high-fidelity 3D aerodynamic benchmarks (car and aircraft), validated by OpenFOAM simulations and miniature wind-tunnel tests with 3D-printed prototypes, demonstrate consistent gains in both optimization and guided generation. Additional offline RL results further support the generality of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03582v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] $V_0$: A Generalist Value Model for Any Policy at State Zero</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03584</link><description>arXiv:2602.03584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods rely on a baseline to measure the relative advantage of an action, ensuring the model reinforces behaviors that outperform its current average capability. In the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Actor-Critic methods (e.g., PPO), this baseline is typically estimated by a Value Model (Critic) often as large as the policy model itself. However, as the policy continuously evolves, the value model requires expensive, synchronous incremental training to accurately track the shifting capabilities of the policy. To avoid this overhead, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) eliminates the coupled value model by using the average reward of a group of rollouts as the baseline; yet, this approach necessitates extensive sampling to maintain estimation stability. In this paper, we propose $V_0$, a Generalist Value Model capable of estimating the expected performance of any model on unseen prompts without requiring parameter updates. We reframe value estimation by treating the policy's dynamic capability as an explicit context input; specifically, we leverage a history of instruction-performance pairs to dynamically profile the model, departing from the traditional paradigm that relies on parameter fitting to perceive capability shifts. Focusing on value estimation at State Zero (i.e., the initial prompt, hence $V_0$), our model serves as a critical resource scheduler. During GRPO training, $V_0$ predicts success rates prior to rollout, allowing for efficient sampling budget allocation; during deployment, it functions as a router, dispatching instructions to the most cost-effective and suitable model. Empirical results demonstrate that $V_0$ significantly outperforms heuristic budget allocation and achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between performance and cost in LLM routing tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03584v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Inference for the Effect of Code Coverage on Bug Introduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03585</link><description>arXiv:2602.03585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Code coverage is widely used as a software quality assurance measure. However, its effect, and specifically the advisable dose, are disputed in both the research and engineering communities. Prior work reports only correlational associations, leaving results vulnerable to confounding factors. Objective: We aim to quantify the causal effect of code coverage (exposure) on bug introduction (outcome) in the context of mature JavaScript and TypeScript open source projects, addressing both the overall effect and its variance across coverage levels. Method: We construct a causal directed acyclic graph to identify confounders within the software engineering process, modeling key variables from the source code, issue- and review systems, and continuous integration. Using generalized propensity score adjustment, we will apply doubly robust regression-based causal inference for continuous exposure to a novel dataset of bug-introducing and non-bug-introducing changes. We estimate the average treatment effect and dose-response relationship to examine potential non-linear patterns (e.g., thresholds or diminishing returns) within the projects of our dataset.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03585v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] APEX: Probing Neural Networks via Activation Perturbation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03586</link><description>arXiv:2602.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work on probing neural networks primarily relies on input-space analysis or parameter perturbation, both of which face fundamental limitations in accessing structural information encoded in intermediate representations. We introduce Activation Perturbation for EXploration (APEX), an inference-time probing paradigm that perturbs hidden activations while keeping both inputs and model parameters fixed. We theoretically show that activation perturbation induces a principled transition from sample-dependent to model-dependent behavior by suppressing input-specific signals and amplifying representation-level structure, and further establish that input perturbation corresponds to a constrained special case of this framework. Through representative case studies, we demonstrate the practical advantages of APEX. In the small-noise regime, APEX provides a lightweight and efficient measure of sample regularity that aligns with established metrics, while also distinguishing structured from randomly labeled models and revealing semantically coherent prediction transitions. In the large-noise regime, APEX exposes training-induced model-level biases, including a pronounced concentration of predictions on the target class in backdoored models. Overall, our results show that APEX offers an effective perspective for exploring, and understanding neural networks beyond what is accessible from input space alone.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03586v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CL-bench: A Benchmark for Context Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03587</link><description>arXiv:2602.03587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current language models (LMs) excel at reasoning over prompts using pre-trained knowledge. However, real-world tasks are far more complex and context-dependent: models must learn from task-specific context and leverage new knowledge beyond what is learned during pre-training to reason and resolve tasks. We term this capability context learning, a crucial ability that humans naturally possess but has been largely overlooked. To this end, we introduce CL-bench, a real-world benchmark consisting of 500 complex contexts, 1,899 tasks, and 31,607 verification rubrics, all crafted by experienced domain experts. Each task is designed such that the new content required to resolve it is contained within the corresponding context. Resolving tasks in CL-bench requires models to learn from the context, ranging from new domain-specific knowledge, rule systems, and complex procedures to laws derived from empirical data, all of which are absent from pre-training. This goes far beyond long-context tasks that primarily test retrieval or reading comprehension, and in-context learning tasks, where models learn simple task patterns via instructions and demonstrations. Our evaluations of ten frontier LMs find that models solve only 17.2% of tasks on average. Even the best-performing model, GPT-5.1, solves only 23.7%, revealing that LMs have yet to achieve effective context learning, which poses a critical bottleneck for tackling real-world, complex context-dependent tasks. CL-bench represents a step towards building LMs with this fundamental capability, making them more intelligent and advancing their deployment in real-world scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03587v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Algorithms for Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problems over Control-flow Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03588</link><description>arXiv:2602.03588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) over control-flow graphs (CFGs) of programs. PCSP serves as a generalization of the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In the CSP framework, we define a set of variables, a set of constraints, and a finite domain $D$ that encompasses all possible values for each variable. The objective is to assign a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In the graph variant of CSP, an underlying graph is considered and we have one variable corresponding to each vertex of the graph and one or several constraints corresponding to each edge. In PCSPs, we allow for certain constraints to be violated at a specified cost, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the total cost. Numerous classical compiler optimization tasks can be framed as PCSPs over control-flow graphs. Examples include Register Allocation, Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE), and Optimal Placement of Bank Selection Instructions. On the other hand, it is well-known that control-flow graphs of structured programs are sparse and decomposable in a variety of ways. In this work, we rely on the Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decompositions as introduced by~\cite{RegisterAllocation}. Our main contribution is a general algorithm for PCSPs over SPL graphs with a time complexity of \(O(|G| \cdot |D|^6)\), where \(|G|\) represents the size of the control-flow graph. Note that for any fixed domain $D,$ this yields a linear-time solution. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization and unification of previous SPL-based approaches for register allocation and LOSPRE. In addition, we provide experimental results over another classical PCSP task, i.e. Optimal Bank Selection, achieving runtimes four times better than the previous state of the art.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03588v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SlowFocus: Enhancing Fine-grained Temporal Understanding in Video LLM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03589</link><description>arXiv:2602.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text understanding, which has paved the way for their expansion into video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to analyze video data. However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simultaneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information (i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism across both existing public video understanding benchmarks and our proposed FineAction-CGR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-Resolution Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection: GBU-UCOD Dataset and Topology-Aware and Frequency-Decoupled Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03591</link><description>arXiv:2602.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) is a challenging task due to the extreme visual similarity between targets and backgrounds across varying marine depths. Existing methods often struggle with topological fragmentation of slender creatures in the deep sea and the subtle feature extraction of transparent organisms. In this paper, we propose DeepTopo-Net, a novel framework that integrates topology-aware modeling with frequency-decoupled perception. To address physical degradation, we design the Water-Conditioned Adaptive Perceptor (WCAP), which employs Riemannian metric tensors to dynamically deform convolutional sampling fields. Furthermore, the Abyssal-Topology Refinement Module (ATRM) is developed to maintain the structural connectivity of spindly targets through skeletal priors. Specifically, we first introduce GBU-UCOD, the first high-resolution (2K) benchmark tailored for marine vertical zonation, filling the data gap for hadal and abyssal zones. Extensive experiments on MAS3K, RMAS, and our proposed GBU-UCOD datasets demonstrate that DeepTopo-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in preserving the morphological integrity of complex underwater patterns.

Abstract: Measuring developer productivity is a topic that has attracted attention from both academic research and industrial practice. In the age of AI coding assistants, it has become even more important for both academia and industry to understand how to measure their impact on developer productivity, and to reconsider whether earlier measures and frameworks still apply. This study analyzes the validity of different approaches to evaluating the productivity impacts of AI coding assistants by leveraging mixed-method research. At BNY Mellon, we conduct a survey with 2989 developer responses and 11 in-depth interviews. Our findings demonstrate that a multifaceted approach is needed to measure AI productivity impacts: survey results expose conflicting perspectives on AI tool usefulness, while interviews elicit six distinct factors that capture both short-term and long-term dimensions of productivity. In contrast to prior work, our factors highlight the importance of long-term metrics like technical expertise and ownership of work. We hope this work encourages future research to incorporate a broader range of human-centered factors, and supports industry in adopting more holistic approaches to evaluating developer productivity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03593v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TIPS Over Tricks: Simple Prompts for Effective Zero-shot Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03594</link><description>arXiv:2602.03594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection identifies departures from expected behavior in safety-critical settings. When target-domain normal data are unavailable, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) leverages vision-language models (VLMs). However, CLIP's coarse image-text alignment limits both localization and detection due to (i) spatial misalignment and (ii) weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies; prior work compensates with complex auxiliary modules yet largely overlooks the choice of backbone. We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos based on textual queries. Current methods mainly rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, this paradigm suffers from heavy data dependence and limited scalability against the rapid evolution of MLLMs. Although recent zero-shot approaches offer a flexible alternative, their performance remains significantly behind SFT-based methods, due to the straightforward workflow designs. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Refer-Agent}, a collaborative multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection mechanisms. This system decomposes RVOS into step-by-step reasoning process. During reasoning, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine frame selection strategy to ensure the frame diversity and textual relevance, along with a Dynamic Focus Layout that adaptively adjusts the agent's visual focus. Furthermore, we propose a Chain-of-Reflection mechanism, which employs a Questioner-Responder pair to generate a self-reflection chain, enabling the system to verify intermediate results and generates feedback for next-round reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate that Refer-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including both SFT-based models and zero-shot approaches. Moreover, Refer-Agent is flexible and enables fast integration of new MLLMs without any additional fine-tuning costs. Code will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03595v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAGE-5GC: Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating Anomaly Detection in the 5G Core Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03596</link><description>arXiv:2602.03596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning-based anomaly detection systems are increasingly being adopted in 5G Core networks to monitor complex, high-volume traffic. However, most existing approaches are evaluated under strong assumptions that rarely hold in operational environments, notably the availability of independent and identically distributed (IID) data and the absence of adaptive attackers.In this work, we study the problem of detecting 5G attacks \textit{in the wild}, focusing on realistic deployment settings. We propose a set of Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating anomaly detectors in 5G Core Network (SAGE-5GC), driven by domain knowledge and consideration of potential adversarial threats. Using a realistic 5G Core dataset, we first train several anomaly detectors and assess their baseline performance against standard 5GC control-plane cyberattacks targeting PFCP-based network services.We then extend the evaluation to adversarial settings, where an attacker tries to manipulate the observable features of the network traffic to evade detection, under the constraint that the intended functionality of the malicious traffic is preserved. Starting from a selected set of controllable features, we analyze model sensitivity and adversarial robustness through randomized perturbations. Finally, we introduce a practical optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms that operates exclusively on attacker-controllable features and does not require prior knowledge of the underlying detection model. Our experimental results show that adversarially crafted attacks can substantially degrade detection performance, underscoring the need for robust, security-aware evaluation methodologies for anomaly detection in 5G networks deployed in the wild.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03596v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Lightweight Library for Energy-Based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03604</link><description>arXiv:2602.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present EB-JEPA, an open-source library for learning representations and world models using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs). JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices demands communication systems that are both spectrally efficient and energy frugal. Backscatter communication (BackCom) is an attractive low-power paradigm, but its spectral efficiency declines in dense deployments. This paper presents an uplink BackCom design that integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and maximizes system energy efficiency (EE). In a bistatic network where multiple backscatter nodes (BNs) harvest RF energy and alternate between sleep and active modes, we formulate a fractional program with coupled time, power, and reflection variables and develop a Dinkelbach-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with closed-form updates. Analysis reveals two operating modes depending on power availability, circuit demands and propagation conditions. Simulations show the proposed design adapts the time allocation, achieving up to 8% higher EE than fixed-power and 68% than no-sleep baselines, and delivering up to 127% EE gains over orthogonal multiple access (OMA).

LLM-based search, or generative engines, provides direct product recommendations to users, rather than traditional online search results that require users to explore options themselves. However, these recommendations are strongly influenced by the initial retrieval order of LLMs, which disadvantages small businesses and independent creators by limiting their visibility.
  In this work, we propose CORE, an optimization method that \textbf{C}ontrols \textbf{O}utput \textbf{R}ankings in g\textbf{E}nerative Engines for LLM-based search. Since the LLM's interactions with the search engine are black-box, CORE targets the content returned by search engines as the primary means of influencing output rankings. Specifically, CORE optimizes retrieved content by appending strategically designed optimization content to steer the ranking of outputs. We introduce three types of optimization content: string-based, reasoning-based, and review-based, demonstrating their effectiveness in shaping output rankings. To evaluate CORE in realistic settings, we introduce ProductBench, a large-scale benchmark with 15 product categories and 200 products per category, where each product is associated with its top-10 recommendations collected from Amazon's search interface.
  Extensive experiments on four LLMs with search capabilities (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, Claude-4, and Grok-3) demonstrate that CORE achieves an average Promotion Success Rate of \textbf{91.4\% @Top-5}, \textbf{86.6\% @Top-3}, and \textbf{80.3\% @Top-1}, across 15 product categories, outperforming existing ranking manipulation methods while preserving the fluency of optimized content.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03608v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explanations Leak: Membership Inference with Differential Privacy and Active Learning Defense</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03611</link><description>arXiv:2602.03611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) are increasingly integrated into Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems to improve transparency; however, ML models deployed via APIs are already vulnerable to privacy attacks such as membership inference and model extraction, and the impact of explanations on this threat landscape remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we focus on the problem of how CFs expand the attack surface of MLaaS by strengthening membership inference attacks (MIAs), and on the need to design defense mechanisms that mitigate this emerging risk without undermining utility and explainability. First, we systematically analyze how exposing CFs through query-based APIs enables more effective shadow-based MIAs. Second, we propose a defense framework that integrates Differential Privacy (DP) with Active Learning (AL) to jointly reduce memorization and limit effective training data exposure. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation to characterize the three-way trade-off between privacy leakage, predictive performance, and explanation quality. Our findings highlight the need to carefully balance transparency, utility, and privacy in the responsible deployment of explainable MLaaS systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03611v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantization-Aware Regularizers for Deep Neural Networks Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03614</link><description>arXiv:2602.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks reached state-of-the-art performance across numerous domains, but this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large and over-parameterized models, posing serious challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. As a result, model compression has become essential, and -- among compression techniques -- weight quantization is largely used and particularly effective, yet it typically introduces a non-negligible accuracy drop. However, it is usually applied to already trained models, without influencing how the parameter space is explored during the learning phase. In contrast, we introduce per-layer regularization terms that drive weights to naturally form clusters during training, integrating quantization awareness directly into the optimization process. This reduces the accuracy loss typically associated with quantization methods while preserving their compression potential. Furthermore, in our framework quantization representatives become network parameters, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to embed quantization parameters directly into the backpropagation procedure. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with AlexNet and VGG16 models confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03614v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KTV: Keyframes and Key Tokens Selection for Efficient Training-Free Video LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03615</link><description>arXiv:2602.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training-free video understanding leverages the strong image comprehension capabilities of pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) by treating a video as a sequence of static frames, thus obviating the need for costly video-specific training. However, this paradigm often suffers from severe visual redundancy and high computational overhead, especially when processing long videos. Crucially, existing keyframe selection strategies, especially those based on CLIP similarity, are prone to biases and may inadvertently overlook critical frames, resulting in suboptimal video comprehension. To address these significant challenges, we propose \textbf{KTV}, a novel two-stage framework for efficient and effective training-free video understanding. In the first stage, KTV performs question-agnostic keyframe selection by clustering frame-level visual features, yielding a compact, diverse, and representative subset of frames that mitigates temporal redundancy. In the second stage, KTV applies key visual token selection, pruning redundant or less informative tokens from each selected keyframe based on token importance and redundancy, which significantly reduces the number of tokens fed into the LLM. Extensive experiments on the Multiple-Choice VideoQA task demonstrate that KTV outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines while using significantly fewer visual tokens, \emph{e.g.}, only 504 visual tokens for a 60-min video with 10800 frames, achieving $44.8\%$ accuracy on the MLVU-Test benchmark. In particular, KTV also exceeds several training-based approaches on certain benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03615v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Query-Specific Rubrics from Human Preferences for DeepResearch Report Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03619</link><description>arXiv:2602.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, training and evaluating DeepResearch-generated reports remain challenging due to the lack of verifiable reward signals. Accordingly, rubric-based evaluation has become a common practice. However, existing approaches either rely on coarse, pre-defined rubrics that lack sufficient granularity, or depend on manually constructed query-specific rubrics that are costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation. To better handle long-horizon reasoning, we further introduce a Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow for report generation. We empirically show that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and better human-aligned supervision than existing rubric design strategies. Moreover, when integrated into the MaMs training framework, DeepResearch systems equipped with our rubric generators consistently outperform all open-source baselines on the DeepResearch Bench and achieve performance comparable to that of leading closed-source models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03619v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quasi-multimodal-based pathophysiological feature learning for retinal disease diagnosis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03622</link><description>arXiv:2602.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retinal diseases spanning a broad spectrum can be effectively identified and diagnosed using complementary signals from multimodal data. However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks. The proposed learning system is thoroughly interpreted through visualizations in both image and feature spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in the tasks of multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy:0.842, Kappa: 0.861). This work not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of retinal disease screening but also offers a scalable framework for data augmentation across various medical imaging modalities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03622v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-supervised Physics-Informed Manipulation of Deformable Linear Objects with Non-negligible Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03623</link><description>arXiv:2602.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects by presenting SPiD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework that couples an accurate deformable object model with an augmented self-supervised training strategy. On the modeling side, we extend a mass-spring model to more accurately capture object dynamics while remaining lightweight enough for high-throughput rollouts during self-supervised learning. On the learning side, we train a neural controller using a task-oriented cost, enabling end-to-end optimization through interaction with the differentiable object model. In addition, we propose a self-supervised DAgger variant that detects distribution shift during deployment and performs offline self-correction to further enhance robustness without expert supervision. We evaluate our method primarily on the rope stabilization task, where a robot must bring a swinging rope to rest as quickly and smoothly as possible. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves fast and smooth rope stabilization, generalizing across unseen initial states, rope lengths, masses, non-uniform mass distributions, and external disturbances. Additionally, we develop an affordable markerless rope perception method and demonstrate that our controller maintains performance with noisy and low-frequency state updates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the framework by extending it to the rope trajectory tracking task. Overall, SPiD offers a data-efficient, robust, and physically grounded framework for dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects, featuring strong sim-to-real generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03623v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Objective Optimization for Synthetic-to-Real Style Transfer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03625</link><description>arXiv:2602.03625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks require large amounts of pixel-level annotated data, which are costly to obtain for real-world images. Computer graphics engines can generate synthetic images alongside their ground-truth annotations. However, models trained on such images can perform poorly on real images due to the domain gap between real and synthetic images. Style transfer methods can reduce this difference by applying a realistic style to synthetic images. Choosing effective data transformations and their sequence is difficult due to the large combinatorial search space of style transfer operators. Using multi-objective genetic algorithms, we optimize pipelines to balance structural coherence and style similarity to target domains. We study the use of paired-image metrics on individual image samples during evolution to enable rapid pipeline evaluation, as opposed to standard distributional metrics that require the generation of many images. After optimization, we evaluate the resulting Pareto front using distributional metrics and segmentation performance. We apply this approach to standard datasets in synthetic-to-real domain adaptation: from the video game GTA5 to real image datasets Cityscapes and ACDC, focusing on adverse conditions. Results demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can propose diverse augmentation pipelines adapted to different objectives. The contribution of this work is the formulation of style transfer as a sequencing problem suitable for evolutionary optimization and the study of efficient metrics that enable feasible search in this space.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have demonstrated impressive accuracy and generalization in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they still face significant limitations, such as high sampling costs and insufficient physical consistency, stemming from their many-step iterative sampling mechanism and lack of explicit physics constraints. To address these issues, we propose Phys-Instruct, a novel physics-guided distillation framework which not only (1) compresses a pre-trained diffusion PDE solver into a few-step generator via matching generator and prior diffusion distributions to enable rapid sampling, but also (2) enhances the physics consistency by explicitly injecting PDE knowledge through a PDE distillation guidance. Physic-Instruct is built upon a solid theoretical foundation, leading to a practical physics-constrained training objective that admits tractable gradients. Across five PDE benchmarks, Phys-Instruct achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference while reducing PDE error by more than 8 times compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines. Moreover, the resulting unconditional student model functions as a compact prior, enabling efficient and physically consistent inference for various downstream conditional tasks. Our results indicate that Phys-Instruct is a novel, effective, and efficient framework for ultra-fast PDE solving powered by deep generative models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03627v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can LLMs Do Rocket Science?

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation and general reasoning, yet their capacity for autonomous multi-stage planning in high-dimensional, physically constrained environments remains an open research question. This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an "LLM-as-a-Judge" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops. We conclude that, while current LLMs often demonstrate sufficient knowledge and intelligence to tackle space science tasks, they remain limited by an implementation barrier, functioning as powerful domain facilitators rather than fully autonomous engineers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03630v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CALM: A Self-Adaptive Orchestration Approach for QoS-Aware Routing in Small Language Model based Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03632</link><description>arXiv:2602.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-enabled systems are subjected to various types of runtime uncertainties, ranging from dynamic workloads, resource requirements, model drift, etc. These uncertainties have a big impact on the overall Quality of Service (QoS). This is particularly true in the case of Language Model (LM) enabled systems where the autoregressive nature of token generation introduces variability in latency, energy usage and response quality. These systems, powered by LLMs, are either resource-intensive (if run on-prem) or raise privacy/cost concerns (if leveraged using APIs). While deploying a Small Language Model (SLM) can be resource-efficient, it often falls short in addressing the diversity and scale of real-world requirements. To this, we argue that, rather than relying on any one SLM, leveraging a coordinated fleet of SLMs, each with specialized strengths can enable systems to dynamically adapt to shifting contexts and workload patterns. However, realizing the full potential of such an approach demands intelligent orchestration and continuous adaptation. To this end, we introduce CALM , a self-adaptive orchestration mechanism based on MAPE-K. Our approach continuously monitors user queries, analyzes the QoS metrics of the SLMs, identifies the optimal SLM to be used, routes the query to the identified SLM and further to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency, leverages caching and scheduling to decide the SLMs to be kept in memory. Our evaluation shows that CALM reduces latency by approximately 40% and energy consumption by 50%, while preserving domain-specific task performance when compared to single-LLM baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03632v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BIRDTurk: Adaptation of the BIRD Text-to-SQL Dataset to Turkish</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03633</link><description>arXiv:2602.03633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems have achieved strong performance on English benchmarks, yet their behavior in morphologically rich, low-resource languages remains largely unexplored. We introduce BIRDTurk, the first Turkish adaptation of the BIRD benchmark, constructed through a controlled translation pipeline that adapts schema identifiers to Turkish while strictly preserving the logical structure and execution semantics of SQL queries and databases. Translation quality is validated on a sample size determined by the Central Limit Theorem to ensure 95% confidence, achieving 98.15% accuracy on human-evaluated samples. Using BIRDTurk, we evaluate inference-based prompting, agentic multi-stage reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. Our results reveal that Turkish introduces consistent performance degradation, driven by both structural linguistic divergence and underrepresentation in LLM pretraining, while agentic reasoning demonstrates stronger cross-lingual robustness. Supervised fine-tuning remains challenging for standard multilingual baselines but scales effectively with modern instruction-tuned models. BIRDTurk provides a controlled testbed for cross-lingual Text-to-SQL evaluation under realistic database conditions. We release the training and development splits to support future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03633v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPWOOD: Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03634</link><description>arXiv:2602.03634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A consistent trend throughout the research of oriented object detection has been the pursuit of maintaining comparable performance with fewer and weaker annotations. This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions. (3) We propose a unique sparse partitioning approach, ensuring equal treatment for each category. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and DIOR datasets show that our framework achieves a significant performance gain over traditional oriented object detection methods mentioned above, offering a highly cost-effective solution.

Abstract: Entropy regularization is a standard technique in reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration, yet it yields negligible effects or even degrades performance in Large Language Models (LLMs). We attribute this failure to the cumulative tail risk inherent to LLMs with massive vocabularies and long generation horizons. In such environments, standard global entropy maximization indiscriminately dilutes probability mass into the vast tail of invalid tokens rather than focusing on plausible candidates, thereby disrupting coherent reasoning. To address this, we propose Trust Region Entropy (TRE), a method that encourages exploration strictly within the model's trust region. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning (MATH), combinatorial search (Countdown), and preference alignment (HH) tasks demonstrate that TRE consistently outperforms vanilla PPO, standard entropy regularization, and other exploration baselines.

Abstract: Sampling-based controllers, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) methods, offer substantial flexibility but often suffer from high variance and low sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid variance-reduced MPPI framework that integrates a prior model into the sampling process. Our key insight is to decompose the objective function into a known approximate model and a residual term. Since the residual captures only the discrepancy between the model and the objective, it typically exhibits a smaller magnitude and lower variance than the original objective. Although this principle applies to general modeling choices, we demonstrate that adopting a quadratic approximation enables the derivation of a closed-form, model-guided prior that effectively concentrates samples in informative regions. Crucially, the framework is agnostic to the source of geometric information, allowing the quadratic model to be constructed from exact derivatives, structural approximations (e.g., Gauss- or Quasi-Newton), or gradient-free randomized smoothing. We validate the approach on standard optimization benchmarks, a nonlinear, underactuated cart-pole control task, and a contact-rich manipulation problem with non-smooth dynamics. Across these domains, we achieve faster convergence and superior performance in low-sample regimes compared to standard MPPI. These results suggest that the method can make sample-based control strategies more practical in scenarios where obtaining samples is expensive or limited.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03639v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tutorial on Reasoning for IR &amp; IR for Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03640</link><description>arXiv:2602.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information retrieval has long focused on ranking documents by semantic relatedness. Yet many real-world information needs demand more: enforcement of logical constraints, multi-step inference, and synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence. Addressing these requirements is, at its core, a problem of reasoning. Across AI communities, researchers are developing diverse solutions for the problem of reasoning, from inference-time strategies and post-training of LLMs, to neuro-symbolic systems, Bayesian and probabilistic frameworks, geometric representations, and energy-based models. These efforts target the same problem: to move beyond pattern-matching systems toward structured, verifiable inference. However, they remain scattered across disciplines, making it difficult for IR researchers to identify the most relevant ideas and opportunities. To help navigate the fragmented landscape of research in reasoning, this tutorial first articulates a working definition of reasoning within the context of information retrieval and derives from it a unified analytical framework. The framework maps existing approaches along axes that reflect the core components of the definition. By providing a comprehensive overview of recent approaches and mapping current methods onto the defined axes, we expose their trade-offs and complementarities, highlight where IR can benefit from cross-disciplinary advances, and illustrate how retrieval process itself can play a central role in broader reasoning systems. The tutorial will equip participants with both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for enhancing reasoning-capable IR systems, while situating IR as a domain that both benefits and contributes to the broader development of reasoning methodologies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03640v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CTTVAE: Latent Space Structuring for Conditional Tabular Data Generation on Imbalanced Datasets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03641</link><description>arXiv:2602.03641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating synthetic tabular data under severe class imbalance is essential for domains where rare but high-impact events drive decision-making. However, most generative models either overlook minority groups or fail to produce samples that are useful for downstream learning. We introduce CTTVAE, a Conditional Transformer-based Tabular Variational Autoencoder equipped with two complementary mechanisms: (i) a class-aware triplet margin loss that restructures the latent space for sharper intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, and (ii) a training-by-sampling strategy that adaptively increases exposure to underrepresented groups. Together, these components form CTTVAE+TBS, a framework that consistently yields more representative and utility-aligned samples without destabilizing training. Across six real-world benchmarks, CTTVAE+TBS achieves the strongest downstream utility on minority classes, often surpassing models trained on the original imbalanced data while maintaining competitive fidelity and bridging the gap for privacy for interpolation-based sampling methods and deep generative methods. Ablation studies further confirm that both latent structuring and targeted sampling contribute to these gains. By explicitly prioritizing downstream performance in rare categories, CTTVAE+TBS provides a robust and interpretable solution for conditional tabular data generation, with direct applicability to industries such as healthcare, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance where even small gains in minority cases can be critical.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03641v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Probabilistic Model-Checking Framework for Cognitive Assessment and Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03643</link><description>arXiv:2602.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serious games have proven to be effective tools for screening cognitive impairments and supporting diagnosis in patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. They also offer cognitive training benefits. According to the DSM-5 classification, cognitive disorders are categorized as Mild Neurocognitive Disorders (mild NCDs) and Major Neurocognitive Disorders (Major NCDs). In this study, we focus on three patient groups: healthy, mild NCD, and Major NCD. We employ Discrete Time Markov Chains to model the behavior exhibited by each group while interacting with serious games. By applying model-checking techniques, we can identify discrepancies between expected and actual gameplay behavior. The primary contribution of this work is a novel theoretical framework designed to assess how a practitioner's confidence level in diagnosing a patient's Alzheimer's stage evolves with each game session (diagnosis support). Additionally, we propose an experimental protocol where the difficulty of subsequent game sessions is dynamically adjusted based on the patient's observed behavior in previous sessions (training support).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03643v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for History-Aware Dense Retriever in RAG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03645</link><description>arXiv:2602.03645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to produce evidence-based responses, and its performance hinges on the matching between the retriever and LLMs. Retriever optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning LLMs. However, existing solutions suffer from objective mismatch between retriever optimization and the goal of RAG pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to address this limitation, yet applying RL to retriever optimization introduces two fundamental challenges: 1) the deterministic retrieval is incompatible with RL formulations, and 2) state aliasing arises from query-only retrieval in multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, we replace deterministic retrieval with stochastic sampling and formulate RAG as a Markov decision process, making retriever optimizable by RL. Further, we incorporate retrieval history into the state at each retrieval step to mitigate state aliasing. Extensive experiments across diverse RAG pipelines, datasets, and retriever scales demonstrate consistent improvements of our approach in RAG performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03645v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Search-R2: Enhancing Search-Integrated Reasoning via Actor-Refiner Collaboration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03647</link><description>arXiv:2602.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search-integrated reasoning enables language agents to transcend static parametric knowledge by actively querying external sources. However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03647v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can Developers rely on LLMs for Secure IaC Development?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03648</link><description>arXiv:2602.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the capabilities of GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash for secure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) development. For security smell detection, on the Stack Overflow dataset, which primarily contains small, simplified code snippets, the models detected at least 71% of security smells when prompted to analyze code from a security perspective (general prompt). With a guided prompt (adding clear, step-by-step instructions), this increased to 78%.In GitHub repositories, which contain complete, real-world project scripts, a general prompt was less effective, leaving more than half of the smells undetected. However, with the guided prompt, the models uncovered at least 67% of the smells. For secure code generation, we prompted LLMs with 89 vulnerable synthetic scenarios and observed that only 7% of the generated scripts were secure. Adding an explicit instruction to generate secure code increased GPT secure output rate to 17%, while Gemini changed little (8%). These results highlight the need for further research to improve LLMs' capabilities in assisting developers with secure IaC development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03648v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAGTurk: Best Practices for Retrieval Augmented Generation in Turkish</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03652</link><description>arXiv:2602.03652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM factuality, yet design guidance remains English-centric, limiting insights for morphologically rich languages like Turkish. We address this by constructing a comprehensive Turkish RAG dataset derived from Turkish Wikipedia and CulturaX, comprising question-answer pairs and relevant passage chunks. We benchmark seven stages of the RAG pipeline, from query transformation and reranking to answer refinement, without task-specific fine-tuning. Our results show that complex methods like HyDE maximize accuracy (85%) that is considerably higher than the baseline (78.70%). Also a Pareto-optimal configuration using Cross-encoder Reranking and Context Augmentation achieves comparable performance (84.60%) with much lower cost. We further demonstrate that over-stacking generative modules can degrade performance by distorting morphological cues, whereas simple query clarification with robust reranking offers an effective solution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03652v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sequential Group Composition: A Window into the Mechanics of Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03655</link><description>arXiv:2602.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do neural networks trained over sequences acquire the ability to perform structured operations, such as arithmetic, geometric, and algorithmic computation? To gain insight into this question, we introduce the sequential group composition task. In this task, networks receive a sequence of elements from a finite group encoded in a real vector space and must predict their cumulative product. The task can be order-sensitive and requires a nonlinear architecture to be learned. Our analysis isolates the roles of the group structure, encoding statistics, and sequence length in shaping learning. We prove that two-layer networks learn this task one irreducible representation of the group at a time in an order determined by the Fourier statistics of the encoding. These networks can perfectly learn the task, but doing so requires a hidden width exponential in the sequence length $k$. In contrast, we show how deeper models exploit the associativity of the task to dramatically improve this scaling: recurrent neural networks compose elements sequentially in $k$ steps, while multilayer networks compose adjacent pairs in parallel in $\log k$ layers. Overall, the sequential group composition task offers a tractable window into the mechanics of deep learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03655v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RIPPLE: Lifecycle-aware Embedding of Service Function Chains in Multi-access Edge Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03662</link><description>arXiv:2602.03662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Multi-access Edge Computing networks, services can be deployed on nearby edge clouds (EC) as service function chains (SFCs) to meet strict quality of service (QoS) requirements. As users move, frequent SFC reconfigurations are required, but these are non-trivial: SFCs can serve users only when all required virtual network functions (VNFs) are available, and VNFs undergo time-consuming lifecycle operations before becoming operational. We show that ignoring lifecycle dynamics oversimplifies deployment, jeopardizes QoS, and must be avoided in practical SFC management. To address this, forecasts of user connectivity can be leveraged to proactively deploy VNFs and reconfigure SFCs. But forecasts are inherently imperfect, requiring lifecycle and connectivity uncertainty to be jointly considered. We present RIPPLE, a lifecycle-aware SFC embedding approach to deploy VNFs at the right time and location, reducing service interruptions. We show that RIPPLE closes the gap with solutions that unrealistically assume instantaneous lifecycle, even under realistic lifecycle constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03662v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Conversational Inertia in Multi-Turn Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03664</link><description>arXiv:2602.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models excel as few-shot learners when provided with appropriate demonstrations, yet this strength becomes problematic in multiturn agent scenarios, where LLMs erroneously mimic their own previous responses as few-shot examples. Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario validate that our framework reduces conversational inertia and achieves performance improvements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03664v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MM-SCALE: Grounded Multimodal Moral Reasoning via Scalar Judgment and Listwise Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03665</link><description>arXiv:2602.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) continue to struggle to make morally salient judgments in multimodal and socially ambiguous contexts. Prior works typically rely on binary or pairwise supervision, which often fail to capture the continuous and pluralistic nature of human moral reasoning. We present MM-SCALE (Multimodal Moral Scale), a large-scale dataset for aligning VLMs with human moral preferences through 5-point scalar ratings and explicit modality grounding. Each image-scenario pair is annotated with moral acceptability scores and grounded reasoning labels by humans using an interface we tailored for data collection, enabling listwise preference optimization over ranked scenario sets. By moving from discrete to scalar supervision, our framework provides richer alignment signals and finer calibration of multimodal moral reasoning. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned on MM-SCALE achieve higher ranking fidelity and more stable safety calibration than those trained with binary signals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03665v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reference-Free EM Validation Flow for Detecting Triggered Hardware Trojans</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03666</link><description>arXiv:2602.03666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware Trojans (HTs) threaten the trust and reliability of integrated circuits (ICs), particularly when triggered HTs remain dormant during standard testing and activate only under rare conditions. Existing electromagnetic (EM) side-channel-based detection techniques often rely on golden references or labeled data, which are infeasible in modern distributed manufacturing. This paper introduces a reference-free, design-agnostic framework for detecting triggered HTs directly from post-silicon EM emissions. The proposed flow converts each EM trace into a time-frequency scalogram using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), extracts discriminative features through a convolutional neural network (CNN), reduces dimensionality with principal component analysis (PCA), and applies Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Modeling (BGMM) for unsupervised probabilistic clustering. The framework quantifies detection confidence using posterior-based metrics (alpha_{post}, beta_{post}), Bayesian information criterion (Delta BIC), and Mahalanobis cluster separation (D), enabling interpretable anomaly decisions without golden data. Experimental validation on AES-128 designs embedded with four different HTs demonstrates high separability between HT-free and HT-activated conditions and robustness to PCA variance thresholds. The results highlight the method's scalability, statistical interpretability, and potential for extension to runtime and in-field HT monitoring in trusted microelectronics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03666v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MVP-LAM: Learning Action-Centric Latent Action via Cross-Viewpoint Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03668</link><description>arXiv:2602.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning \emph{latent actions} from diverse human videos enables scaling robot learning beyond embodiment-specific robot datasets, and these latent actions have recently been used as pseudo-action labels for vision-language-action (VLA) model pretraining. To make VLA pretraining effective, latent actions should contain information about the underlying agent's actions despite the absence of ground-truth labels. We propose \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew\textbf{P}oint \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}ction \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MVP-LAM}), which learns discrete latent actions that are highly informative about ground-truth actions from time-synchronized multi-view videos. MVP-LAM trains latent actions with a \emph{cross-viewpoint reconstruction} objective, so that a latent action inferred from one view must explain the future in another view, reducing reliance on viewpoint-specific cues. On Bridge V2, MVP-LAM produces more action-centric latent actions, achieving higher mutual information with ground-truth actions and improved action prediction, including under out-of-distribution evaluation. Finally, pretraining VLAs with MVP-LAM latent actions improves downstream manipulation performance on the SIMPLER and LIBERO-Long benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03668v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Sequential Neural Network with Spatial-Temporal Attention and Linear LSTM for Robust Lane Detection Using Multi-Frame Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03669</link><description>arXiv:2602.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane detection is a crucial perception task for all levels of automated vehicles (AVs) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, particularly in mixed-traffic environments where AVs must interact with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and challenging traffic scenarios. Current methods lack versatility in delivering accurate, robust, and real-time compatible lane detection, especially vision-based methods often neglect critical regions of the image and their spatial-temporal (ST) salience, leading to poor performance in difficult circumstances such as serious occlusion and dazzle lighting. This study introduces a novel sequential neural network model with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on key features of lane lines and exploit salient ST correlations among continuous image frames. The proposed model, built on a standard encoder-decoder structure and common neural network backbones, is trained and evaluated on three large-scale open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength and robustness of the proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various testing scenarios. Furthermore, with the ST attention mechanism, the developed sequential neural network models exhibit fewer parameters and reduced Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to baseline sequential models, highlighting their computational efficiency.

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a physics-inspired learning algorithm that uses stationary states of a dynamical system both for inference and learning. In its original formulation it is limited to conservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ to dynamics which derive from an energy function. Given their importance in applications, it is important to extend EP to nonconservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to generalize EP to such systems failed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Here we propose a framework that extends EP to arbitrary nonconservative systems, including feedforward networks. We keep the key property of equilibrium propagation, namely the use of stationary states both for inference and learning. However, we modify the dynamics in the learning phase by a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of the interaction so as to obtain the exact gradient of the cost function. This algorithm can also be derived using a variational formulation that generates the learning dynamics through an energy function defined over an augmented state space. Numerical experiments using the MNIST database show that this algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03670v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Referring Industrial Anomaly Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03673</link><description>arXiv:2602.03673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is vital for manufacturing, yet traditional methods face significant challenges: unsupervised approaches yield rough localizations requiring manual thresholds, while supervised methods overfit due to scarce, imbalanced data. Both suffer from the "One Anomaly Class, One Model" limitation. To address this, we propose Referring Industrial Anomaly Segmentation (RIAS), a paradigm leveraging language to guide detection. RIAS generates precise masks from text descriptions without manual thresholds and uses universal prompts to detect diverse anomalies with a single model. We introduce the MVTec-Ref dataset to support this, designed with diverse referring expressions and focusing on anomaly patterns, notably with 95% small anomalies. We also propose the Dual Query Token with Mask Group Transformer (DQFormer) benchmark, enhanced by Language-Gated Multi-Level Aggregation (LMA) to improve multi-scale segmentation. Unlike traditional methods using redundant queries, DQFormer employs only "Anomaly" and "Background" tokens for efficient visual-textual integration. Experiments demonstrate RIAS's effectiveness in advancing IAD toward open-set capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-robot teams must coordinate to operate effectively. When a team operates in an uncoordinated manner, and agents choose actions that are only individually optimal, the team's outcome can suffer. However, in many domains, coordination requires costly communication. We explore the value of coordination in a broad class of differentiable motion-planning problems. In particular, we model coordinated behavior as a spectrum: at one extreme, agents jointly optimize a common team objective, and at the other, agents make unilaterally optimal decisions given their individual decision variables, i.e., they operate at Nash equilibria. We then demonstrate that reasoning about coordination in differentiable motion-planning problems reduces to reasoning about the second-order properties of agents' objectives, and we provide algorithms that use this second-order reasoning to determine at which times a team of agents should coordinate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03674v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Instruction Anchors: Dissecting the Causal Dynamics of Modality Arbitration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03677</link><description>arXiv:2602.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modality following serves as the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to selectively utilize multimodal contexts based on user instructions. It is fundamental to ensuring safety and reliability in real-world deployments. However, the underlying mechanisms governing this decision-making process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate its working mechanism through an information flow lens. Our findings reveal that instruction tokens function as structural anchors for modality arbitration: Shallow attention layers perform non-selective information transfer, routing multimodal cues to these anchors as a latent buffer; Modality competition is resolved within deep attention layers guided by the instruction intent, while MLP layers exhibit semantic inertia, acting as an adversarial force. Furthermore, we identify a sparse set of specialized attention heads that drive this arbitration. Causal interventions demonstrate that manipulating a mere $5\%$ of these critical heads can decrease the modality-following ratio by $60\%$ through blocking, or increase it by $60\%$ through targeted amplification of failed samples. Our work provides a substantial step toward model transparency and offers a principled framework for the orchestration of multimodal information in MLLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03677v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ContraLog: Log File Anomaly Detection with Contrastive Learning and Masked Language Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03678</link><description>arXiv:2602.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Log files record computational events that reflect system state and behavior, making them a primary source of operational insights in modern computer systems. Automated anomaly detection on logs is therefore critical, yet most established methods rely on log parsers that collapse messages into discrete templates, discarding variable values and semantic content. We propose ContraLog, a parser-free and self-supervised method that reframes log anomaly detection as predicting continuous message embeddings rather than discrete template IDs. ContraLog combines a message encoder that produces rich embeddings for individual log messages with a sequence encoder to model temporal dependencies within sequences. The model is trained with a combination of masked language modeling and contrastive learning to predict masked message embeddings based on the surrounding context. Experiments on the HDFS, BGL, and Thunderbird benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate effectiveness on complex datasets with diverse log messages. Additionally, we find that message embeddings generated by ContraLog carry meaningful information and are predictive of anomalies even without sequence context. These results highlight embedding-level prediction as an approach for log anomaly detection, with potential applicability to other event sequences.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03678v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Attention Search Linear: Towards Adaptive Token-Level Hybrid Attention Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03681</link><description>arXiv:2602.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of softmax transformers has become a bottleneck in long-context scenarios. In contrast, linear attention model families provide a promising direction towards a more efficient sequential model. These linear attention models compress past KV values into a single hidden state, thereby efficiently reducing complexity during both training and inference. However, their expressivity remains limited by the size of their hidden state. Previous work proposed interleaving softmax and linear attention layers to reduce computational complexity while preserving expressivity. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these models remains bottlenecked by their softmax attention layers. In this paper, we propose Neural Attention Search Linear (NAtS-L), a framework that applies both linear attention and softmax attention operations within the same layer on different tokens. NAtS-L automatically determines whether a token can be handled by a linear attention model, i.e., tokens that have only short-term impact and can be encoded into fixed-size hidden states, or require softmax attention, i.e., tokens that contain information related to long-term retrieval and need to be preserved for future queries. By searching for optimal Gated DeltaNet and softmax attention combinations across tokens, we show that NAtS-L provides a strong yet efficient token-level hybrid architecture.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03681v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Universal One-third Time Scaling in Learning Peaked Distributions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03685</link><description>arXiv:2602.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, partly because the loss exhibits slow power-law convergence whose origin remains debatable. Through systematic analysis of toy models and empirical evaluation of LLMs, we show that this behavior can arise intrinsically from the use of softmax and cross-entropy. When learning peaked probability distributions, e.g., next-token distributions, these components yield power-law vanishing losses and gradients, creating a fundamental optimization bottleneck. This ultimately leads to power-law time scaling of the loss with a universal exponent of $1/3$. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for observed neural scaling and suggest new directions for improving LLM training efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03685v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QuAIL: Quality-Aware Inertial Learning for Robust Training under Data Corruption</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03686</link><description>arXiv:2602.03686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular machine learning systems are frequently trained on data affected by non-uniform corruption, including noisy measurements, missing entries, and feature-specific biases. In practice, these defects are often documented only through column-level reliability indicators rather than instance-wise quality annotations, limiting the applicability of many robustness and cleaning techniques. We present QuAIL, a quality-informed training mechanism that incorporates feature reliability priors directly into the learning process. QuAIL augments existing models with a learnable feature-modulation layer whose updates are selectively constrained by a quality-dependent proximal regularizer, thereby inducing controlled adaptation across features of varying trustworthiness. This stabilizes optimization under structured corruption without explicit data repair or sample-level reweighting. Empirical evaluation across 50 classification and regression datasets demonstrates that QuAIL consistently improves average performance over neural baselines under both random and value-dependent corruption, with especially robust behavior in low-data and systematically biased settings. These results suggest that incorporating feature reliability information directly into optimization dynamics is a practical and effective approach for resilient tabular learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03686v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Investment in Multi-Agent Models of Public Transportation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03687</link><description>arXiv:2602.03687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two stylized, multi-agent models aimed at investing a limited, indivisible resource in public transportation. In the first model, we face the decision of which potential stops to open along a (e.g., bus) path, given agents' travel demands. While it is known that utilitarian optimal solutions can be identified in polynomial time, we find that computing approximately optimal solutions with respect to egalitarian welfare is NP-complete. This is surprising as we operate on the simple topology of a line graph.
  In the second model, agents navigate a more complex network modeled by a weighted graph where edge weights represent distances. We face the decision of improving travel time along a fixed number of edges. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm that combines Dijkstra's algorithm with a dynamical program to find the optimal decision for one or two agents. By contrast, if the number of agents is variable, we find \np-completeness and inapproximability results for utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Moreover, we demonstrate implications of our results for a related model of railway network design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03687v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TodyComm: Task-Oriented Dynamic Communication for Multi-Round LLM-based Multi-Agent System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03688</link><description>arXiv:2602.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-round LLM-based multi-agent systems rely on effective communication structures to support collaboration across rounds. However, most existing methods employ a fixed communication topology during inference, which falls short in many realistic applications where the agents' roles may change \textit{across rounds} due to dynamic adversary, task progression, or time-varying constraints such as communication bandwidth.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain brittle under realistic retrieval noise, even when the required evidence appears in the top-K results. A key reason is that retrievers and rerankers optimize solely for relevance, often selecting either trivial, answer-revealing passages or evidence that lacks the critical information required to answer the question, without considering whether the evidence is suitable for the generator. We propose BAR-RAG, which reframes the reranker as a boundary-aware evidence selector that targets the generator's Goldilocks Zone -- evidence that is neither trivially easy nor fundamentally unanswerable for the generator, but is challenging yet sufficient for inference and thus provides the strongest learning signal. BAR-RAG trains the selector with reinforcement learning using generator feedback, and adopts a two-stage pipeline that fine-tunes the generator under the induced evidence distribution to mitigate the distribution mismatch between training and inference. Experiments on knowledge-intensive question answering benchmarks show that BAR-RAG consistently improves end-to-end performance under noisy retrieval, achieving an average gain of 10.3 percent over strong RAG and reranking baselines while substantially improving robustness.

Abstract: We consider small-data, large-scale decision problems in which a firm must make many operational decisions simultaneously (e.g., across a large product portfolio) while observing only a few, potentially noisy, data points per instance. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we propose a pretrain-then-finetune approach built on a designed Transformer model to address this challenge. The model is first pretrained on large-scale, domain-informed synthetic data that encode managerial knowledge and structural features of the decision environment, and is then fine-tuned on real observations. This new pipeline offers two complementary advantages: pretraining injects domain knowledge into the learning process and enables the training of high-capacity models using abundant synthetic data, while finetuning adapts the pretrained model to the operational environment and improves alignment with the true data-generating regime. While we have leveraged the Transformer's state-of-the-art representational capacity, particularly its attention mechanism, to efficiently extract cross-task structure, our approach is not an off-the-shelf application. Instead, it relies on problem-specific architectural design and a tailored training procedure to match the decision setting. Theoretically, we develop the first comprehensive error analysis regarding Transformer learning in relevant contexts, establishing nonasymptotic guarantees that validate the method's effectiveness. Critically, our analysis reveals how pretraining and fine-tuning jointly determine performance, with the dominant contribution governed by whichever is more favorable. In particular, finetuning exhibits an economies-of-scale effect, whereby transfer learning becomes increasingly effective as the number of instances grows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03690v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Input-to-State Safe Backstepping: Robust Safety-Critical Control with Unmatched Uncertainties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03691</link><description>arXiv:2602.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guaranteeing safety in the presence of unmatched disturbances -- uncertainties that cannot be directly canceled by the control input -- remains a key challenge in nonlinear control. This paper presents a constructive approach to safety-critical control of nonlinear systems with unmatched disturbances. We first present a generalization of the input-to-state safety (ISSf) framework for systems with these uncertainties using the recently developed notion of an Optimal Decay CBF, which provides more flexibility for satisfying the associated Lyapunov-like conditions for safety. From there, we outline a procedure for constructing ISSf-CBFs for two relevant classes of systems with unmatched uncertainties: i) strict-feedback systems; ii) dual-relative-degree systems, which are similar to differentially flat systems. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations of an inverted pendulum and planar quadrotor.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03691v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bringing Reasoning to Generative Recommendation Through the Lens of Cascaded Ranking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03692</link><description>arXiv:2602.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) has become a promising end-to-end approach with high FLOPS utilization for resource-efficient recommendation. Despite the effectiveness, we show that current GR models suffer from a critical \textbf{bias amplification} issue, where token-level bias escalates as token generation progresses, ultimately limiting the recommendation diversity and hurting the user experience. By comparing against the key factor behind the success of traditional multi-stage pipelines, we reveal two limitations in GR that can amplify the bias: homogeneous reliance on the encoded history, and fixed computational budgets that prevent deeper user preference understanding.
  To combat the bias amplification issue, it is crucial for GR to 1) incorporate more heterogeneous information, and 2) allocate greater computational resources at each token generation step. To this end, we propose CARE, a simple yet effective cascaded reasoning framework for debiased GR. To incorporate heterogeneous information, we introduce a progressive history encoding mechanism, which progressively incorporates increasingly fine-grained history information as the generation process advances. To allocate more computations, we propose a query-anchored reasoning mechanism, which seeks to perform a deeper understanding of historical information through parallel reasoning steps. We instantiate CARE on three GR backbones. Empirical results on four datasets show the superiority of CARE in recommendation accuracy, diversity, efficiency, and promising scalability. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Linxyhaha/CARE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03692v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OCRTurk: A Comprehensive OCR Benchmark for Turkish</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03693</link><description>arXiv:2602.03693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document parsing is now widely used in applications, such as large-scale document digitization, retrieval-augmented generation, and domain-specific pipelines in healthcare and education. Benchmarking these models is crucial for assessing their reliability and practical robustness. Existing benchmarks mostly target high-resource languages and provide limited coverage for low-resource settings, such as Turkish. Moreover, existing studies on Turkish document parsing lack a standardized benchmark that reflects real-world scenarios and document diversity. To address this gap, we introduce OCRTurk, a Turkish document parsing benchmark covering multiple layout elements and document categories at three difficulty levels. OCRTurk consists of 180 Turkish documents drawn from academic articles, theses, slide decks, and non-academic articles. We evaluate seven OCR models on OCRTurk using element-wise metrics. Across difficulty levels, PaddleOCR achieves the strongest overall results, leading most element-wise metrics except figures and attaining high Normalized Edit Distance scores in easy, medium, and hard subsets. We also observe performance variation by document type. Models perform well on non-academic documents, while slideshows become the most challenging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agent Primitives: Reusable Latent Building Blocks for Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03695</link><description>arXiv:2602.03695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While existing multi-agent systems (MAS) can handle complex problems by enabling collaboration among multiple agents, they are often highly task-specific, relying on manually crafted agent roles and interaction prompts, which leads to increased architectural complexity and limited reusability across tasks. Moreover, most MAS communicate primarily through natural language, making them vulnerable to error accumulation and instability in long-context, multi-stage interactions within internal agent histories.
  In this work, we propose \textbf{Agent Primitives}, a set of reusable latent building blocks for LLM-based MAS. Inspired by neural network design, where complex models are built from reusable components, we observe that many existing MAS architectures can be decomposed into a small number of recurring internal computation patterns. Based on this observation, we instantiate three primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution. All primitives communicate internally via key-value (KV) cache, which improves both robustness and efficiency by mitigating information degradation across multi-stage interactions. To enable automatic system construction, an Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations, forming a primitive-based MAS.
  Experiments show that primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5\% over single-agent baselines, reduce token usage and inference latency by approximately 3$\times$-4$\times$ compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3$\times$-1.6$\times$ overhead relative to single-agent inference and providing more stable performance across model backbones.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03695v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Generalized Knowledge Editing with Multiple Updates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03696</link><description>arXiv:2602.03696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on internal knowledge to solve many downstream tasks, making it crucial to keep them up to date. Since full retraining is expensive, prior work has explored efficient alternatives such as model editing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, these approaches often break down in practice due to poor generalization across inputs, limited stability, and knowledge conflict. To address these limitations, we propose the CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) training framework, a parameter-efficient, holistic approach for knowledge editing with multiple updates. CoRSA tackles multiple challenges simultaneously: it improves generalization to different input forms and enhances stability across multiple updates by minimizing loss curvature, and resolves conflicts by maximizing the margin between new and prior knowledge. Across three widely used fact editing benchmarks, CoRSA achieves significant gains in generalization, outperforming baselines with average absolute improvements of 12.42% over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods. With multiple updates, it maintains high update efficacy while reducing catastrophic forgetting by 27.82% compared to LoRA. CoRSA also generalizes to the code domain, outperforming the strongest baseline by 5.48% Pass@5 in update efficacy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03696v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-Driven Graph Filters via Adaptive Spectral Shaping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03698</link><description>arXiv:2602.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Spectral Shaping, a data-driven framework for graph filtering that learns a reusable baseline spectral kernel and modulates it with a small set of Gaussian factors. The resulting multi-peak, multi-scale responses allocate energy to heterogeneous regions of the Laplacian spectrum while remaining interpretable via explicit centers and bandwidths. To scale, we implement filters with Chebyshev polynomial expansions, avoiding eigendecompositions. We further propose Transferable Adaptive Spectral Shaping (TASS): the baseline kernel is learned on source graphs and, on a target graph, kept fixed while only the shaping parameters are adapted, enabling few-shot transfer under matched compute. Across controlled synthetic benchmarks spanning graph families and signal regimes, Adaptive Spectral Shaping reduces reconstruction error relative to fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks, and TASS yields consistent positive transfer. The framework provides compact spectral modules that plug into graph signal processing pipelines and graph neural networks, combining scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03698v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Formal Analysis of Capacity Scaling Algorithms for Minimum-Cost Flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03701</link><description>arXiv:2602.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present formalisations of the correctness of executable algorithms to solve minimum-cost flow problems in Isabelle/HOL. Two of the algorithms are based on the technique of scaling, most notably Orlin's algorithm, which has the fastest known running time for solving the problem of minimum-cost flow. We also include a formalisation of the worst-case running time argument for Orlin's algorithm. Our verified implementation of this algorithm, which is derived by the technique of stepwise refinement, is fully executable and was integrated into a reusable formal library on graph algorithms. Because the problems for which Orlin's algorithm works are restricted, we also verified an executable reduction from the general minimum-cost flow problem. We believe we are the first to formally consider the problem of minimum-cost flows and, more generally, any scaling algorithms. Our work has also led to a number of mathematical insights and improvements to proofs as well as theorem statements, compared to all existing expositions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03701v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Anytime Pretraining: Horizon-Free Learning-Rate Schedules with Weight Averaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03702</link><description>arXiv:2602.03702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly trained in continual or open-ended settings, where the total training horizon is not known in advance. Despite this, most existing pretraining recipes are not anytime: they rely on horizon-dependent learning rate schedules and extensive tuning under a fixed compute budget. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the existence of anytime learning schedules for overparameterized linear regression, and we highlight the central role of weight averaging - also known as model merging - in achieving the minimax convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent. We show that these anytime schedules polynomially decay with time, with the decay rate determined by the source and capacity conditions of the problem. Empirically, we evaluate 150M and 300M parameter language models trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and $1/\sqrt{t}$ schedules with weight averaging against a well-tuned cosine schedule. Across the full training range, the anytime schedules achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay. Taken together, our results suggest that weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large language model pretraining.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03702v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cognitively Diverse Multiple-Choice Question Generation: A Hybrid Multi-Agent Framework with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03704</link><description>arXiv:2602.03704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made automated multiple-choice question (MCQ) generation increasingly feasible; however, reliably producing items that satisfy controlled cognitive demands remains a challenge. To address this gap, we introduce ReQUESTA, a hybrid, multi-agent framework for generating cognitively diverse MCQs that systematically target text-based, inferential, and main idea comprehension. ReQUESTA decomposes MCQ authoring into specialized subtasks and coordinates LLM-powered agents with rule-based components to support planning, controlled generation, iterative evaluation, and post-processing. We evaluated the framework in a large-scale reading comprehension study using academic expository texts, comparing ReQUESTA-generated MCQs with those produced by a single-pass GPT-5 zero-shot baseline. Psychometric analyses of learner responses assessed item difficulty and discrimination, while expert raters evaluated question quality across multiple dimensions, including topic relevance and distractor quality. Results showed that ReQUESTA-generated items were consistently more challenging, more discriminative, and more strongly aligned with overall reading comprehension performance. Expert evaluations further indicated stronger alignment with central concepts and superior distractor linguistic consistency and semantic plausibility, particularly for inferential questions. These findings demonstrate that hybrid, agentic orchestration can systematically improve the reliability and controllability of LLM-based generation, highlighting workflow design as a key lever for structured artifact generation beyond single-pass prompting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03704v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OmniRAG-Agent: Agentic Omnimodal Reasoning for Low-Resource Long Audio-Video Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03707</link><description>arXiv:2602.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon omnimodal question answering answers questions by reasoning over text, images, audio, and video. Despite recent progress on OmniLLMs, low-resource long audio-video QA still suffers from costly dense encoding, weak fine-grained retrieval, limited proactive planning, and no clear end-to-end optimization.To address these issues, we propose OmniRAG-Agent, an agentic omnimodal QA method for budgeted long audio-video reasoning. It builds an image-audio retrieval-augmented generation module that lets an OmniLLM fetch short, relevant frames and audio snippets from external banks. Moreover, it uses an agent loop that plans, calls tools across turns, and merges retrieved evidence to answer complex queries. Furthermore, we apply group relative policy optimization to jointly improve tool use and answer quality over time. Experiments on OmniVideoBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni show that OmniRAG-Agent consistently outperforms prior methods under low-resource settings and achieves strong results, with ablations validating each component.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03707v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Tokens: Semantic-Aware Speculative Decoding for Efficient Inference by Probing Internal States</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03708</link><description>arXiv:2602.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many tasks but suffer from high inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. The issue is exacerbated in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which generate lengthy chains of thought. While speculative decoding accelerates inference by drafting and verifying multiple tokens in parallel, existing methods operate at the token level and ignore semantic equivalence (i.e., different token sequences expressing the same meaning), leading to inefficient rejections. We propose SemanticSpec, a semantic-aware speculative decoding framework that verifies entire semantic sequences instead of tokens. SemanticSpec introduces a semantic probability estimation mechanism that probes the model's internal hidden states to assess the likelihood of generating sequences with specific meanings.Experiments on four benchmarks show that SemanticSpec achieves up to 2.7x speedup on DeepSeekR1-32B and 2.1x on QwQ-32B, consistently outperforming token-level and sequence-level baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03708v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] No Shortcuts to Culture: Indonesian Multi-hop Question Answering for Complex Cultural Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03709</link><description>arXiv:2602.03709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding culture requires reasoning across context, tradition, and implicit social knowledge, far beyond recalling isolated facts. Yet most culturally focused question answering (QA) benchmarks rely on single-hop questions, which may allow models to exploit shallow cues rather than demonstrate genuine cultural reasoning. In this work, we introduce ID-MoCQA, the first large-scale multi-hop QA dataset for assessing the cultural understanding of large language models (LLMs), grounded in Indonesian traditions and available in both English and Indonesian. We present a new framework that systematically transforms single-hop cultural questions into multi-hop reasoning chains spanning six clue types (e.g., commonsense, temporal, geographical). Our multi-stage validation pipeline, combining expert review and LLM-as-a-judge filtering, ensures high-quality question-answer pairs. Our evaluation across state-of-the-art models reveals substantial gaps in cultural reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring nuanced inference. ID-MoCQA provides a challenging and essential benchmark for advancing the cultural competency of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03709v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SWE-Refactor: A Repository-Level Benchmark for Real-World LLM-Based Code Refactoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03712</link><description>arXiv:2602.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently attracted wide interest for tackling software engineering tasks. In contrast to code generation, refactoring demands precise, semantics-preserving edits that improve program structure, which also makes automated evaluation challenging. However, existing refactoring benchmarks commonly suffer from three shortcomings: limited coverage of refactoring scenarios, the inclusion of instances that mix refactoring with unrelated changes, and insufficient repository-level context for realistic assessment. To mitigate these issues, we introduce SWE-Refactor, a new benchmark for LLM-based code refactoring. SWE-Refactor comprises 1,099 developer-written, behavior-preserving refactorings mined from 18 Java projects, including 922 atomic and 177 compound instances. Each instance is validated via compilation, test execution, and automated refactoring detection tools to ensure correctness. We evaluate nine widely used LLMs on SWE-Refactor, covering models such as GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and CodeLLaMa, to provide representative reference results. Our results show that complex and compound refactorings remain the primary source of failures; notably, an OpenAI Codex agent achieves only 39.4% success on compound instances. We release SWE-Refactor and all evaluation results to facilitate future research on LLM-based code refactoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03712v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Generative Recommendation for Fusing Semantic and Collaborative Signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03713</link><description>arXiv:2602.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems rank relevant items by modeling a user's interaction history and computing the inner product between the resulting user representation and stored item embeddings. To avoid the significant memory overhead of storing large item sets, the generative recommendation paradigm instead models each item as a series of discrete semantic codes. Here, the next item is predicted by an autoregressive model that generates the code sequence corresponding to the predicted item. However, despite promising ranking capabilities on small datasets, these methods have yet to surpass traditional sequential recommenders on large item sets, limiting their adoption in the very scenarios they were designed to address. To resolve this, we propose MSCGRec, a Multimodal Semantic and Collaborative Generative Recommender. MSCGRec incorporates multiple semantic modalities and introduces a novel self-supervised quantization learning approach for images based on the DINO framework. Additionally, MSCGRec fuses collaborative and semantic signals by extracting collaborative features from sequential recommenders and treating them as a separate modality. Finally, we propose constrained sequence learning that restricts the large output space during training to the set of permissible tokens. We empirically demonstrate on three large real-world datasets that MSCGRec outperforms both sequential and generative recommendation baselines and provide an extensive ablation study to validate the impact of each component.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03713v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training Multi-Turn Search Agent via Contrastive Dynamic Branch Sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03719</link><description>arXiv:2602.03719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning has enabled large language models to perform complex multi-turn planning and tool use. However, learning in long-horizon settings remains challenging due to sparse, trajectory-level outcome rewards. While prior tree-based methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often suffer from high variance and computational inefficiency. Through empirical analysis of search agents, We identify a common pattern: performance diverges mainly due to decisions near the tail. Motivated by this observation, we propose Branching Relative Policy Optimization (BranPO), a value-free method that provides step-level contrastive supervision without dense rewards. BranPO truncates trajectories near the tail and resamples alternative continuations to construct contrastive suffixes over shared prefixes, reducing credit ambiguity in long-horizon rollouts. To further boost efficiency and stabilize training, we introduce difficulty-aware branch sampling to adapt branching frequency across tasks, and redundant step masking to suppress uninformative actions. Extensive experiments on various question answering benchmarks demonstrate that BranPO consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significant accuracy gains on long-horizon tasks without increasing the overall training budget.

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized probability densities is a central challenge in computational science. Boltzmann generators are generative models that enable independent sampling from the Boltzmann distribution of physical systems at a given temperature. However, their practical success depends on data-efficient training, as both simulation data and target energy evaluations are costly. To this end, we propose off-policy log-dispersion regularization (LDR), a novel regularization framework that builds on a generalization of the log-variance objective. We apply LDR in the off-policy setting in combination with standard data-based training objectives, without requiring additional on-policy samples. LDR acts as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape by leveraging additional information in the form of target energy labels. The proposed regularization framework is broadly applicable, supporting unbiased or biased simulation datasets as well as purely variational training without access to target samples. Across all benchmarks, LDR improves both final performance and data efficiency, with sample efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03729v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CUBO: Self-Contained Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Consumer Laptops 10 GB Corpora, 16 GB RAM, Single-Device Deployment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03731</link><description>arXiv:2602.03731v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The Multiplicative Weights Exponential Mechanism (MWEM) is a fundamental iterative framework for private data analysis, with broad applications such as answering $m$ linear queries, or privately solving systems of $m$ linear constraints. However, a critical bottleneck hindering its scalability is the $\Theta(m)$ time complexity required to execute the exponential mechanism in each iteration. We introduce a modification to the MWEM framework that improves the per-iteration runtime dependency to $\Theta(\sqrt{m})$ in expectation. This is done via a lazy sampling approach to the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism, which we implement efficiently using Gumbel noise and a $k$-Nearest Neighbor data structure. This allows for the rapid selection of the approximate score in the exponential mechanism without an exhaustive linear scan. We apply our accelerated framework to the problems of private linear query release and solving Linear Programs (LPs) under neighboring constraint conditions and low-sensitivity assumptions. Experimental evaluation confirms that our method provides a substantial runtime improvement over classic MWEM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03732v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RegionReasoner: Region-Grounded Multi-Round Visual Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03733</link><description>arXiv:2602.03733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models have achieved remarkable progress in visual reasoning, yet most existing systems rely on single-step or text-only reasoning, limiting their ability to iteratively refine understanding across multiple visual contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a new multi-round visual reasoning benchmark with training and test sets spanning both detection and segmentation tasks, enabling systematic evaluation under iterative reasoning scenarios. We further propose RegionReasoner, a reinforcement learning framework that enforces grounded reasoning by requiring each reasoning trace to explicitly cite the corresponding reference bounding boxes, while maintaining semantic coherence via a global-local consistency reward. This reward extracts key objects and nouns from both global scene captions and region-level captions, aligning them with the reasoning trace to ensure consistency across reasoning steps. RegionReasoner is optimized with structured rewards combining grounding fidelity and global-local semantic alignment.

Abstract: Monitoring bottom-hole variables in petroleum wells is essential for production optimization, safety, and emissions reduction. Permanent Downhole Gauges (PDGs) provide real-time pressure data but face reliability and cost issues. We propose a machine learning-based soft sensor to estimate flowing Bottom-Hole Pressure (BHP) using wellhead and topside measurements. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is introduced and compared with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Ridge Regression. We also pioneer Transfer Learning for adapting models across operational environments. Tested on real offshore datasets from Brazil's Pre-salt basin, the methodology achieved Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) consistently below 2\%, outperforming benchmarks. This work offers a cost-effective, accurate alternative to physical sensors, with broad applicability across diverse reservoir and flow conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03737v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Edge-Optimized Vision-Language Models for Underground Infrastructure Assessment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03742</link><description>arXiv:2602.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous inspection of underground infrastructure, such as sewer and culvert systems, is critical to public safety and urban sustainability. Although robotic platforms equipped with visual sensors can efficiently detect structural deficiencies, the automated generation of human-readable summaries from these detections remains a significant challenge, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline for end-to-end summarization of underground deficiencies, combining our lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployed on an edge computing platform. The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. We deploy and evaluate our complete pipeline on a mobile robotic platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world inspection scenarios. Our results show the potential of edge-deployable integrated AI systems to bridge the gap between automated defect detection and actionable insights for infrastructure maintenance, paving the way for more scalable and autonomous inspection solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03742v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Occlusion-Free Conformal Lensing for Spatiotemporal Visualization in 3D Urban Analytics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03743</link><description>arXiv:2602.03743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The visualization of temporal data on urban buildings, such as shadows, noise, and solar potential, plays a critical role in the analysis of dynamic urban phenomena. However, in dense and geographically constrained 3D urban environments, visual representations of time-varying building data often suffer from occlusion and visual clutter. To address these two challenges, we introduce an immersive lens visualization that integrates a view-dependent cutaway de-occlusion technique and a temporal display derived from a conformal mapping algorithm. The mapping process first partitions irregular building footprints into smaller, sufficiently regular subregions that serve as structural primitives. These subregions are then seamlessly recombined to form a conformal, layered layout for our temporal lens visualization. The view-responsive cutaway is inspired by traditional architectural illustrations, preserving the overall layout of the building and its surroundings to maintain users' sense of spatial orientation. This lens design enables the occlusion-free embedding of shape-adaptive temporal displays across building facades on demand, supporting rapid time-space association for the discovery, access and interpretation of spatiotemporal urban patterns. Guided by domain and design goals, we outline the rationale behind the lens visual and interaction design choices, such as the encoding of time progression and temporal values in the conforming lens image. A user study compares our approach against conventional juxtaposition and x-ray spatiotemporal designs. Results validate the usage and utility of our lens, showing that it improves task accuracy and completion time, reduces navigation effort, and increases user confidence. From these findings, we distill design recommendations and promising directions for future research on spatially-embedded lenses in 3D visualization and urban analytics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03743v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LIVE: Long-horizon Interactive Video World Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03747</link><description>arXiv:2602.03747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive video world models predict future visual observations conditioned on actions. While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation. Moreover, we provide an unified view that encompasses different approaches and introduce progressive training curriculum to stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate that LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-shot large vision-language model prompting for automated bone identification in paleoradiology x-ray archives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03750</link><description>arXiv:2602.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paleoradiology, the use of modern imaging technologies to study archaeological and anthropological remains, offers new windows on millennial scale patterns of human health. Unfortunately, the radiographs collected during field campaigns are heterogeneous: bones are disarticulated, positioning is ad hoc, and laterality markers are often absent. Additionally, factors such as age at death, age of bone, sex, and imaging equipment introduce high variability. Thus, content navigation, such as identifying a subset of images with a specific projection view, can be time consuming and difficult, making efficient triaging a bottleneck for expert analysis. We report a zero shot prompting strategy that leverages a state of the art Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) to automatically identify the main bone, projection view, and laterality in such images. Our pipeline converts raw DICOM files to bone windowed PNGs, submits them to the LVLM with a carefully engineered prompt, and receives structured JSON outputs, which are extracted and formatted onto a spreadsheet in preparation for validation. On a random sample of 100 images reviewed by an expert board certified paleoradiologist, the system achieved 92% main bone accuracy, 80% projection view accuracy, and 100% laterality accuracy, with low or medium confidence flags for ambiguous cases. These results suggest that LVLMs can substantially accelerate code word development for large paleoradiology datasets, allowing for efficient content navigation in future anthropology workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03750v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Test-Time Conditioning with Representation-Aligned Visual Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03753</link><description>arXiv:2602.03753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While representation alignment with self-supervised models has been shown to improve diffusion model training, its potential for enhancing inference-time conditioning remains largely unexplored. We introduce Representation-Aligned Guidance (REPA-G), a framework that leverages these aligned representations, with rich semantic properties, to enable test-time conditioning from features in generation. By optimizing a similarity objective (the potential) at inference, we steer the denoising process toward a conditioned representation extracted from a pre-trained feature extractor. Our method provides versatile control at multiple scales, ranging from fine-grained texture matching via single patches to broad semantic guidance using global image feature tokens. We further extend this to multi-concept composition, allowing for the faithful combination of distinct concepts. REPA-G operates entirely at inference time, offering a flexible and precise alternative to often ambiguous text prompts or coarse class labels. We theoretically justify how this guidance enables sampling from the potential-induced tilted distribution. Quantitative results on ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality, diverse generations.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) libraries like TensorFlow and Pytorch simplify machine learning (ML) model development but are prone to bugs due to their complex design. Bug-finding techniques exist, but without precise API specifications, they produce many false alarms. Existing methods to mine API specifications lack accuracy. We explore using ML classifiers to determine input validity. We hypothesize that tensor shapes are a precise abstraction to encode concrete inputs and capture relationships of the data. Shape abstraction severely reduces problem dimensionality, which is important to facilitate ML training. Labeled data are obtained by observing runtime outcomes on a sample of inputs and classifiers are trained on sets of labeled inputs to capture API constraints. Our evaluation, conducted over 183 APIs from TensorFlow and Pytorch, shows that the classifiers generalize well on unseen data with over 91% accuracy. Integrating these classifiers into the pipeline of ACETest, a SoTA bug-finding technique, improves its pass rate from ~29% to ~61%. Our findings suggest that ML-enhanced input classification is an important aid to scale DL library testing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03755v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Timing-Based Attacks in Real-Time Cyber-Physical Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03757</link><description>arXiv:2602.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time cyber-physical systems depend on deterministic task execution to guarantee safety and correctness. Unfortunately, this determinism can unintentionally expose timing information that enables adversaries to infer task execution patterns and carry out timing-based attacks targeting safety-critical control tasks. While prior defenses aim to obscure schedules through randomization or isolation, they typically neglect the implications of such modifications on closed-loop control behavior and real-time feasibility. This work studies the problem of securing real-time control workloads against timing inference attacks while explicitly accounting for both schedulability constraints and control performance requirements. We present a scheduling-based mitigation approach that introduces bounded timing perturbations to control task executions in a structured manner, reducing adversarial opportunities without violating real-time guarantees. The framework jointly considers worst-case execution behavior and the impact of execution delays on control performance, enabling the system to operate within predefined safety and performance limits. Through experimental evaluation on representative task sets and control scenarios, the proposed approach demonstrates that exposure to timing-based attacks can be significantly reduced while preserving predictable execution and acceptable control quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03757v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAWDet-7: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Object Detection and Description on Quantized RAW Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03760</link><description>arXiv:2602.03760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most vision models are trained on RGB images processed through ISP pipelines optimized for human perception, which can discard sensor-level information useful for machine reasoning. RAW images preserve unprocessed scene data, enabling models to leverage richer cues for both object detection and object description, capturing fine-grained details, spatial relationships, and contextual information often lost in processed images. To support research in this domain, we introduce RAWDet-7, a large-scale dataset of ~25k training and 7.6k test RAW images collected across diverse cameras, lighting conditions, and environments, densely annotated for seven object categories following MS-COCO and LVIS conventions. In addition, we provide object-level descriptions derived from the corresponding high-resolution sRGB images, facilitating the study of object-level information preservation under RAW image processing and low-bit quantization. The dataset allows evaluation under simulated 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit quantization, reflecting realistic sensor constraints, and provides a benchmark for studying detection performance, description quality &amp; detail, and generalization in low-bit RAW image processing.

Abstract: Human vision is foveated, with variable resolution peaking at the center of a large field of view; this reflects an efficient trade-off for active sensing, allowing eye-movements to bring different parts of the world into focus with other parts of the world in context. In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) models now often outperform traditional physics-based models on common metrics while requiring orders-of-magnitude less computing resources and time. Open-access AIWP models thus hold promise as transformational tools for helping low- and middle-income populations make decisions in the face of high-impact weather shocks. Yet, current approaches to evaluating AIWP models focus mainly on aggregated meteorological metrics without considering local stakeholders' needs in decision-oriented, operational frameworks. Here, we introduce such a framework that connects meteorology, AI, and social sciences. As an example, we apply it to the 150-year-old problem of Indian monsoon forecasting, focusing on benefits to rain-fed agriculture, which is highly susceptible to climate change. AIWP models skillfully predict an agriculturally relevant onset index at regional scales weeks in advance when evaluated out-of-sample using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. This framework informed a government-led effort in 2025 to send 38 million Indian farmers AI-based monsoon onset forecasts, which captured an unusual weeks-long pause in monsoon progression. This decision-oriented benchmarking framework provides a key component of a blueprint for harnessing the power of AIWP models to help large vulnerable populations adapt to weather shocks in the face of climate variability and change.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03767v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning with Latent Tokens in Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03769</link><description>arXiv:2602.03769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently become competitive with autoregressive models for language modeling, even outperforming them on reasoning tasks requiring planning and global coherence, but they require more computation at inference time. We trace this trade-off to a key mechanism: diffusion models are trained to jointly predict a distribution over all unknown tokens, including those that will not actually be decoded in the current step. Ablating this joint prediction yields faster inference but degrades performance, revealing that accurate prediction at the decoded position relies on joint reasoning about the distribution of undecoded tokens. We interpret these as latent tokens and introduce a method for modulating their number, demonstrating empirically that this enables a smooth tradeoff between inference speed and sample quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that latent tokens can be introduced into autoregressive models through an auxiliary multi-token prediction objective, yielding substantial improvements on the same reasoning tasks where they have traditionally struggled. Our results suggest that latent tokens, while arising naturally in diffusion, represent a general mechanism for improving performance on tasks requiring global coherence or lookahead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03769v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniGeM: Unifying Data Mixing and Selection via Geometric Exploration and Mining</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03772</link><description>arXiv:2602.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly limited by data quality.

We introduce \textbf{UniGeM}, a framework that unifies mixing and selection by treating data curation as a \textit{manifold approximation} problem without training proxy models or relying on external reference datasets. UniGeM operates hierarchically: \textbf{Macro-Exploration} learns mixing weights with stability-based clustering; \textbf{Micro-Mining} filters high-quality instances by their geometric distribution to ensure logical consistency. Validated by training 8B and 16B MoE models on 100B tokens, UniGeM achieves \textbf{2.0$\times$ data efficiency} over a random baseline and further improves overall performance compared to SOTA methods in reasoning-heavy evaluations and multilingual generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03772v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning Cache: Continual Improvement Over Long Horizons via Short-Horizon RL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03773</link><description>arXiv:2602.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) that can continually improve beyond their training budgets are able to solve increasingly difficult problems by adapting at test time, a property we refer to as extrapolation. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) operates over fixed problem distributions and training budgets, which limits extrapolation amidst distribution shift at test time. To address this, we introduce RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. RC exploits an asymmetry between the response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations. Models trained to use RC can extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than those seen during training. Empirically, training a 4B model with RC using a 16k-token training budget improves performance on HMMT 2025 from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m tokens at test time, outperforming both comparably sized models and many larger reasoning LLMs. Finally, we also show that models trained with RC can more effectively leverage existing scaffolds to further scale test-time performance, due to the improved summary-conditioned generation abilities learned through training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03773v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Empirical Study of Collective Behaviors and Social Dynamics in Large Language Model Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03775</link><description>arXiv:2602.03775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate our social, cultural, and political interactions. While they can simulate some aspects of human behavior and decision-making, it is still underexplored whether repeated interactions with other agents amplify their biases or lead to exclusionary behaviors. To this end, we study Chirper.ai-an LLM-driven social media platform-analyzing 7M posts and interactions among 32K LLM agents over a year. We start with homophily and social influence among LLMs, learning that similar to humans', their social networks exhibit these fundamental phenomena. Next, we study the toxic language of LLMs, its linguistic features, and their interaction patterns, finding that LLMs show different structural patterns in toxic posting than humans. After studying the ideological leaning in LLMs posts, and the polarization in their community, we focus on how to prevent their potential harmful activities. We present a simple yet effective method, called Chain of Social Thought (CoST), that reminds LLM agents to avoid harmful posting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03775v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Separate Compilation to Sound Language Composition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03777</link><description>arXiv:2602.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of programming languages involves complex theoretical and practical challenges, particularly when addressing modularity and reusability through language extensions. While language workbenches aim to enable modular development under the constraints of the language extension problem, one critical constraint -- separate compilation -- is often relaxed due to its complexity. However, this relaxation undermines artifact reusability and integration with common dependency systems. A key difficulty under separate compilation arises from managing attribute grammars, as extensions may introduce new attributes that invalidate previously generated abstract syntax tree structures. Existing approaches, such as the use of dynamic maps in the Neverlang workbench, favor flexibility at the cost of compile-time correctness, leading to potential runtime errors due to undefined attributes. This work addresses this issue by introducing nlgcheck, a theoretically sound static analysis tool based on data-flow analysis for the Neverlang language workbench. nlgcheck detects potential runtime errors -- such as undefined attribute accesses -- at compile time, preserving separate compilation while maintaining strong static correctness guarantees. Experimental evaluation using mutation testing on Neverlang-based projects demonstrates that nlgcheck effectively enhances robustness without sacrificing modularity or flexibility and with a level of performance that does not impede its adoption in daily development activities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03777v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reward Redistribution for CVaR MDPs using a Bellman Operator on L-infinity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03778</link><description>arXiv:2602.03778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tail-end risk measures such as static conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are used in safety-critical applications to prevent rare, yet catastrophic events. Unlike risk-neutral objectives, the static CVaR of the return depends on entire trajectories without admitting a recursive Bellman decomposition in the underlying Markov decision process. A classical resolution relies on state augmentation with a continuous variable. However, unless restricted to a specialized class of admissible value functions, this formulation induces sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of the static CVaR objective based on augmentation. Our alternative approach leads to a Bellman operator with: (1) dense per-step rewards; (2) contracting properties on the full space of bounded value functions. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms that rely on discretized augmented states. We further provide convergence guarantees and approximation error bounds due to discretization. Empirical results demonstrate that our algorithms successfully learn CVaR-sensitive policies and achieve effective performance-safety trade-offs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03778v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Scene Graph Backed Approach to Open Set Semantic Mapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03781</link><description>arXiv:2602.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Open Set Semantic Mapping and 3D Semantic Scene Graphs (3DSSGs) are established paradigms in robotic perception, deploying them effectively to support high-level reasoning in large-scale, real-world environments remains a significant challenge. Most existing approaches decouple perception from representation, treating the scene graph as a derivative layer generated post hoc. This limits both consistency and scalability. In contrast, we propose a mapping architecture where the 3DSSG serves as the foundational backend, acting as the primary knowledge representation for the entire mapping process.
  Our approach leverages prior work on incremental scene graph prediction to infer and update the graph structure in real-time as the environment is explored. This ensures that the map remains topologically consistent and computationally efficient, even during extended operations in large-scale settings. By maintaining an explicit, spatially grounded representation that supports both flat and hierarchical topologies, we bridge the gap between sub-symbolic raw sensor data and high-level symbolic reasoning. Consequently, this provides a stable, verifiable structure that knowledge-driven frameworks, ranging from knowledge graphs and ontologies to Large Language Models (LLMs), can directly exploit, enabling agents to operate with enhanced interpretability, trustworthiness, and alignment to human concepts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03781v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QVLA: Not All Channels Are Equal in Vision-Language-Action Model's Quantization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03782</link><description>arXiv:2602.03782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represents a significant leap for embodied intelligence, yet their immense computational demands critically hinder deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware. Code will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03782v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Estimation of Kernel Surrogate Models for Task Attribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03783</link><description>arXiv:2602.03783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI agents such as large language models are trained on diverse tasks -- translation, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and text prediction -- simultaneously. A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines. When used for downstream task selection, kernel surrogate models yield a $40\%$ improvement in demonstration selection for in-context learning and multi-objective reinforcement learning benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03783v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context Compression via Explicit Information Transmission</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03784</link><description>arXiv:2602.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context inference with Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly due to quadratic attention and growing key-value caches, motivating context compression. In this work, we study soft context compression, where a long context is condensed into a small set of continuous representations. Existing methods typically re-purpose the LLM itself as a trainable compressor, relying on layer-by-layer self-attention to iteratively aggregate information. We argue that this paradigm suffers from two structural limitations: (i) progressive representation overwriting across layers (ii) uncoordinated allocation of compression capacity across tokens. We propose ComprExIT (Context Compression via Explicit Information Transmission), a lightweight framework that formulates soft compression into a new paradigm: explicit information transmission over frozen LLM hidden states. This decouples compression from the model's internal self-attention dynamics. ComprExIT performs (i) depth-wise transmission to selectively transmit multi-layer information into token anchors, mitigating progressive overwriting, and (ii) width-wise transmission to aggregate anchors into a small number of slots via a globally optimized transmission plan, ensuring coordinated allocation of information. Across six question-answering benchmarks, ComprExIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art context compression methods while introducing only ~1% additional parameters, demonstrating that explicit and coordinated information transmission enables more effective and robust long-context compression.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03784v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inference-time Unlearning Using Conformal Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03787</link><description>arXiv:2602.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning is the process of efficiently removing specific information from a trained machine learning model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning methods, which often provide provable guarantees, typically involve retraining a subset of model parameters based on a forget set. While these approaches show promise in certain scenarios, their underlying assumptions are often challenged in real-world applications -- particularly when applied to generative models. Furthermore, updating parameters using these unlearning procedures often degrades the general-purpose capabilities the model acquired during pre-training. Motivated by these shortcomings, this paper considers the paradigm of inference time unlearning -- wherein, the generative model is equipped with an (approximately correct) verifier that judges whether the model's response satisfies appropriate unlearning guarantees. This paper introduces a framework that iteratively refines the quality of the generated responses using feedback from the verifier without updating the model parameters. The proposed framework leverages conformal prediction to reduce computational overhead and provide distribution-free unlearning guarantees. This paper's approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, reducing unlearning error by up to 93% across challenging unlearning benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03787v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Should I use Synthetic Data for That?

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modelling have led many to see synthetic data as the go-to solution for a range of problems around data access, scarcity, and under-representation. In this paper, we study three prominent use cases: (1) Sharing synthetic data as a proxy for proprietary datasets to enable statistical analyses while protecting privacy, (2) Augmenting machine learning training sets with synthetic data to improve model performance, and (3) Augmenting datasets with synthetic data to reduce variance in statistical estimation. For each use case, we formalise the problem setting and study, through formal analysis and case studies, under which conditions synthetic data can achieve its intended objectives. We identify fundamental and practical limits that constrain when synthetic data can serve as an effective solution for a particular problem. Our analysis reveals that due to these limits many existing or envisioned use cases of synthetic data are a poor problem fit. Our formalisations and classification of synthetic data use cases enable decision makers to assess whether synthetic data is a suitable approach for their specific data availability problem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03791v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BridgeV2W: Bridging Video Generation Models to Embodied World Models via Embodiment Masks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03793</link><description>arXiv:2602.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied world models have emerged as a promising paradigm in robotics, most of which leverage large-scale Internet videos or pretrained video generation models to enrich visual and motion priors. However, they still face key challenges: a misalignment between coordinate-space actions and pixel-space videos, sensitivity to camera viewpoint, and non-unified architectures across embodiments. To this end, we present BridgeV2W, which converts coordinate-space actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks rendered from the URDF and camera parameters. These masks are then injected into a pretrained video generation model via a ControlNet-style pathway, which aligns the action control signals with predicted videos, adds view-specific conditioning to accommodate camera viewpoints, and yields a unified world model architecture across embodiments. To mitigate overfitting to static backgrounds, BridgeV2W further introduces a flow-based motion loss that focuses on learning dynamic and task-relevant regions. Experiments on single-arm (DROID) and dual-arm (AgiBot-G1) datasets, covering diverse and challenging conditions with unseen viewpoints and scenes, show that BridgeV2W improves video generation quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the potential of BridgeV2W on downstream real-world tasks, including policy evaluation and goal-conditioned planning.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex tasks that are difficult for individual LLMs. A natural strategy is to scale performance by increasing the number of agents; however, we find that such scaling exhibits strong diminishing returns in homogeneous settings, while introducing heterogeneity (e.g., different models, prompts, or tools) continues to yield substantial gains. This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents. Our results provide principled guidelines for building efficient and robust MAS through diversity-aware design.

Abstract: Existing methods for human motion control in video generation typically rely on either 2D poses or explicit 3D parametric models (e.g., SMPL) as control signals. However, 2D poses rigidly bind motion to the driving viewpoint, precluding novel-view synthesis. Explicit 3D models, though structurally informative, suffer from inherent inaccuracies (e.g., depth ambiguity and inaccurate dynamics) which, when used as a strong constraint, override the powerful intrinsic 3D awareness of large-scale video generators. In this work, we revisit motion control from a 3D-aware perspective, advocating for an implicit, view-agnostic motion representation that naturally aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on externally reconstructed constraints. We introduce 3DiMo, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens, injected semantically via cross-attention. To foster 3D awareness, we train with view-rich supervision (i.e., single-view, multi-view, and moving-camera videos), forcing motion consistency across diverse viewpoints. Additionally, we use auxiliary geometric supervision that leverages SMPL only for early initialization and is annealed to zero, enabling the model to transition from external 3D guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding from the data and the generator's priors. Experiments confirm that 3DiMo faithfully reproduces driving motions with flexible, text-driven camera control, significantly surpassing existing methods in both motion fidelity and visual quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03796v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Manifold Random Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03797</link><description>arXiv:2602.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new paradigm for creating random features to approximate bi-variate functions (in particular, kernels) defined on general manifolds. This new mechanism of Manifold Random Features (MRFs) leverages discretization of the manifold and the recently introduced technique of Graph Random Features (GRFs) to learn continuous fields on manifolds. Those fields are used to find continuous approximation mechanisms that otherwise, in general scenarios, cannot be derived analytically. MRFs provide positive and bounded features, a key property for accurate, low-variance approximation. We show deep asymptotic connection between GRFs, defined on discrete graph objects, and continuous random features used for regular kernels. As a by-product of our method, we re-discover recently introduced mechanism of Gaussian kernel approximation applied in particular to improve linear-attention Transformers, considering simple random walks on graphs and by-passing original complex mathematical computations. We complement our algorithm with a rigorous theoretical analysis and verify in thorough experimental studies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03797v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FullStack-Agent: Enhancing Agentic Full-Stack Web Coding via Development-Oriented Testing and Repository Back-Translation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03798</link><description>arXiv:2602.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assisting non-expert users to develop complex interactive websites has become a popular task for LLM-powered code agents. However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Designing provably safe control is a core problem in trustworthy autonomy. However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03799v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prediction of Critical Heat Flux in Rod Bundles Using Tube-Based Hybrid Machine Learning Models in CTF</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03805</link><description>arXiv:2602.03805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of critical heat flux (CHF) using machine learning (ML) approaches has become a highly active research activity in recent years, the goal of which is to build models more accurate than current conventional approaches such as empirical correlations or lookup tables (LUTs). Previous work developed and deployed tube-based pure and hybrid ML models in the CTF subchannel code, however, full-scale reactor core simulations require the use of rod bundle geometries. Unlike isolated subchannels, rod bundles experience complex thermal hydraulic phenomena such as channel crossflow, spacer grid losses, and effects from unheated conductors. This study investigates the generalization of ML-based CHF prediction models in rod bundles after being trained on tube-based CHF data. A purely data-driven DNN and two hybrid bias-correction models were implemented in the CTF subchannel code and used to predict CHF location and magnitude in the Combustion Engineering 5-by-5 bundle CHF test series. The W-3 correlation, Bowring correlation, and Groeneveld LUT were used as baseline comparators. On average, all three ML-based approaches produced magnitude and location predictions more accurate than the baseline models, with the hybrid LUT model exhibiting the most favorable performance metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03805v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging Online and Offline RL: Contextual Bandit Learning for Multi-Turn Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03806</link><description>arXiv:2602.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation.

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification in graph neural networks (GNNs) happens when some labels are much more common than others, which causes the model to learn unfairly and perform badly on the less common classes. To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed) similar to how humans learn. The model begins by engaging with structurally simpler features, defined as (1) local neighbourhood patterns (1-hop), (2) low-degree node attributes, and (3) class-separable node pairs identified via initial graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks (GCN and GAT) embeddings. This foundation enables stable early learning despite label skew. The Enact stage then addresses complicated aspects: (1) connections that require multiple steps, (2) edges that connect different types of nodes, and (3) nodes at the edges of minority classes by using adjustable attention weights. Finally, Embed consolidates these features via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting. We evaluate CL3AN-GNN on eight Open Graph Benchmark datasets spanning social, biological, and citation networks. Experiments show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over recent state-of-the-art methods. The model's step-by-step method works well with different types of graph datasets, showing quicker results than training everything at once, better performance on new, imbalanced graphs, and clear explanations of each step using gradient stability and attention correlation learning curves. This work provides both a theoretically grounded framework for curriculum learning in GNNs and practical evidence of its effectiveness against imbalances, validated through metrics, convergence speeds, and generalisation tests.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03808v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Progressive Checkerboards for Autoregressive Multiscale Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03811</link><description>arXiv:2602.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in autoregressive image generation is to efficiently sample independent locations in parallel, while still modeling mutual dependencies with serial conditioning. Some recent works have addressed this by conditioning between scales in a multiscale pyramid. Others have looked at parallelizing samples in a single image using regular partitions or randomized orders. In this work we examine a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. Our ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step. This enables effective conditioning both between and within scales. Intriguingly, we find evidence that in our balanced setting, a wide range of scale-up factors lead to similar results, so long as the total number of serial steps is constant. On class-conditional ImageNet, our method achieves competitive performance compared to recent state-of-the-art autoregressive systems with like model capacity, using fewer sampling steps.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03811v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Antidistillation Fingerprinting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03812</link><description>arXiv:2602.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model distillation enables efficient emulation of frontier large language models (LLMs), creating a need for robust mechanisms to detect when a third-party student model has trained on a teacher model's outputs. However, existing fingerprinting techniques that could be used to detect such distillation rely on heuristic perturbations that impose a steep trade-off between generation quality and fingerprinting strength, often requiring significant degradation of utility to ensure the fingerprint is effectively internalized by the student. We introduce antidistillation fingerprinting (ADFP), a principled approach that aligns the fingerprinting objective with the student's learning dynamics. Building upon the gradient-based framework of antidistillation sampling, ADFP utilizes a proxy model to identify and sample tokens that directly maximize the expected detectability of the fingerprint in the student after fine-tuning, rather than relying on the incidental absorption of the un-targeted biases of a more naive watermark. Experiments on GSM8K and OASST1 benchmarks demonstrate that ADFP achieves a significant Pareto improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, yielding stronger detection confidence with minimal impact on utility, even when the student model's architecture is unknown.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03812v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conformal Thinking: Risk Control for Reasoning on a Compute Budget</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03814</link><description>arXiv:2602.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) enable test-time scaling, with dataset-level accuracy improving as the token budget increases, motivating adaptive reasoning -- spending tokens when they improve reliability and stopping early when additional computation is unlikely to help. However, setting the token budget, as well as the threshold for adaptive reasoning, is a practical challenge that entails a fundamental risk-accuracy trade-off. We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage). Given a target risk and a validation set, we use distribution-free risk control to optimally specify these stopping mechanisms. For scenarios with multiple budget controlling criteria, we incorporate an efficiency loss to select the most computationally efficient exiting mechanism. Empirical results across diverse reasoning tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk control approach, demonstrating computational efficiency gains from the lower threshold and ensemble stopping mechanisms while adhering to the user-specified risk target.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03814v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast-Slow Efficient Training for Multimodal Large Language Models via Visual Token Pruning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03815</link><description>arXiv:2602.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from severe training inefficiency issue, which is associated with their massive model sizes and visual token numbers. Existing efforts in efficient training focus on reducing model sizes or trainable parameters. Inspired by the success of Visual Token Pruning (VTP) in improving inference efficiency, we are exploring another substantial research direction for efficient training by reducing visual tokens. However, applying VTP at the training stage results in a training-inference mismatch: pruning-trained models perform poorly when inferring on non-pruned full visual token sequences. To close this gap, we propose DualSpeed, a fast-slow framework for efficient training of MLLMs. The fast-mode is the primary mode, which incorporates existing VTP methods as plugins to reduce visual tokens, along with a mode isolator to isolate the model's behaviors. The slow-mode is the auxiliary mode, where the model is trained on full visual sequences to retain training-inference consistency. To boost its training, it further leverages self-distillation to learn from the sufficiently trained fast-mode. Together, DualSpeed can achieve both training efficiency and non-degraded performance. Experiments show DualSpeed accelerates the training of LLaVA-1.5 by 2.1$\times$ and LLaVA-NeXT by 4.0$\times$, retaining over 99% performance.

Abstract: We propose SymPlex, a reinforcement learning framework for discovering analytical symbolic solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) without access to ground-truth expressions. SymPlex formulates symbolic PDE solving as tree-structured decision-making and optimizes candidate solutions using only the PDE and its boundary conditions. At its core is SymFormer, a structure-aware Transformer that models hierarchical symbolic dependencies via tree-relative self-attention and enforces syntactic validity through grammar-constrained autoregressive decoding, overcoming the limited expressivity of sequence-based generators. Unlike numerical and neural approaches that approximate solutions in discretized or implicit function spaces, SymPlex operates directly in symbolic expression space, enabling interpretable and human-readable solutions that naturally represent non-smooth behavior and explicit parametric dependence. Empirical results demonstrate exact recovery of non-smooth and parametric PDE solutions using deep learning-based symbolic methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03816v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Evidence Weighting for Audio-Spatiotemporal Fusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03817</link><description>arXiv:2602.03817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many machine learning systems have access to multiple sources of evidence for the same prediction target, yet these sources often differ in reliability and informativeness across inputs. In bioacoustic classification, species identity may be inferred both from the acoustic signal and from spatiotemporal context such as location and season; while Bayesian inference motivates multiplicative evidence combination, in practice we typically only have access to discriminative predictors rather than calibrated generative models. We introduce \textbf{F}usion under \textbf{IN}dependent \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{H}ypotheses (\textbf{FINCH}), an adaptive log-linear evidence fusion framework that integrates a pre-trained audio classifier with a structured spatiotemporal predictor. FINCH learns a per-sample gating function that estimates the reliability of contextual information from uncertainty and informativeness statistics. The resulting fusion family \emph{contains} the audio-only classifier as a special case and explicitly bounds the influence of contextual evidence, yielding a risk-contained hypothesis class with an interpretable audio-only fallback. Across benchmarks, FINCH consistently outperforms fixed-weight fusion and audio-only baselines, improving robustness and error trade-offs even when contextual information is weak in isolation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on CBI and competitive or improved performance on several subsets of BirdSet using a lightweight, interpretable, evidence-based approach.

Abstract: Openness and programmability in the O-RAN architecture enable closed-loop control of the Radio Access Network (RAN). Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven xApps, in the near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), can learn from network data, anticipate future conditions, and dynamically adapt radio configurations. However, their development and adoption are hindered by the complexity of low-level RAN control and monitoring message models exposed over the O-RAN E2 interface, limited interoperability across heterogeneous RAN software stacks, and the lack of developer-friendly frameworks. In this paper, we introduce xDevSM, a framework that significantly lowers the barrier to xApp development by unifying observability and control in O-RAN deployment. By exposing a rich set of Key Performance Measurements (KPMs) and enabling fine-grained radio resource management controls, xDevSM provides the essential foundation for practical AI-driven xApps. We validate xDevSM on real-world testbeds, leveraging Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) devices together with heterogeneous RAN hardware, including Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)-based Software-defined Radios (SDRs) and Foxconn radio units, and show its seamless interoperability across multiple open-source RAN software stacks. Furthermore, we discuss and evaluate the capabilities of our framework through three O-RAN-based scenarios of high interest: (i) KPM-based monitoring of network performance, (ii) slice-level Physical Resource Block (PRB) allocation control across multiple User Equipments (UEs) and slices, and (iii) mobility-aware handover control, showing that xDevSM can implement intelligent closed-loop applications, laying the groundwork for learning-based optimization in heterogeneous RAN deployments. xDevSM is open source and available as foundational tool for the research community.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03821v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] They Said Memes Were Harmless-We Found the Ones That Hurt: Decoding Jokes, Symbols, and Cultural References</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03822</link><description>arXiv:2602.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meme-based social abuse detection is challenging because harmful intent often relies on implicit cultural symbolism and subtle cross-modal incongruence. Prior approaches, from fusion-based methods to in-context learning with Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), have made progress but remain limited by three factors: i) cultural blindness (missing symbolic context), ii) boundary ambiguity (satire vs. abuse confusion), and iii) lack of interpretability (opaque model reasoning). We introduce CROSS-ALIGN+, a three-stage framework that systematically addresses these limitations: (1) Stage I mitigates cultural blindness by enriching multimodal representations with structured knowledge from ConceptNet, Wikidata, and Hatebase; (2) Stage II reduces boundary ambiguity through parameter-efficient LoRA adapters that sharpen decision boundaries; and (3) Stage III enhances interpretability by generating cascaded explanations. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks and eight LVLMs demonstrate that CROSS-ALIGN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 17% relative F1 improvement while providing interpretable justifications for each decision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Intervention Learning from Emergency Stop Interventions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03825</link><description>arXiv:2602.03825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human interventions are a common source of data in autonomous systems during testing. These interventions provide an important signal about where the current policy needs improvement, but are often noisy and incomplete. We define Robust Intervention Learning (RIL) as the problem of learning from intervention data while remaining robust to the quality and informativeness of the intervention signal. In the best case, interventions are precise and avoiding them is sufficient to solve the task, but in many realistic settings avoiding interventions is necessary but not sufficient for achieving good performance. We study robust intervention learning in the context of emergency stop interventions and propose Residual Intervention Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a residual fine-tuning algorithm that treats intervention feedback as an incomplete learning signal and explicitly combines it with a prior policy. By framing intervention learning as a fine-tuning problem, our approach leverages structure encoded in the prior policy to resolve ambiguity when intervention signals under-specify the task. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing conditions under which this formulation yields principled policy improvement, and identify regimes where intervention learning is expected to fail. Our experiments reveal that residual fine-tuning enables robust and consistent policy improvement across a range of intervention strategies and prior policy qualities, and highlight robust intervention learning as a promising direction for future work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03825v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Continuous Control of Editing Models via Adaptive-Origin Guidance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03826</link><description>arXiv:2602.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based editing models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic image and video manipulation. However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03826v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Perfect Network Resilience in Polynomial Time</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03827</link><description>arXiv:2602.03827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern communication networks support local fast rerouting mechanisms to quickly react to link failures: nodes store a set of conditional rerouting rules which define how to forward an incoming packet in case of incident link failures. The rerouting decisions at any node $v$ must rely solely on local information available at $v$: the link from which a packet arrived at $v$, the target of the packet, and the incident link failures at $v$. Ideally, such rerouting mechanisms provide perfect resilience: any packet is routed from its source to its target as long as the two are connected in the underlying graph after the link failures. Already in their seminal paper at ACM PODC '12, Feigenbaum, Godfrey, Panda, Schapira, Shenker, and Singla showed that perfect resilience cannot always be achieved. While the design of local rerouting algorithms has received much attention since then, we still lack a detailed understanding of when perfect resilience is achievable.
  This paper closes this gap and presents a complete characterization of when perfect resilience can be achieved. This characterization also allows us to design an $O(n)$-time algorithm to decide whether a given instance is perfectly resilient and an $O(nm)$-time algorithm to compute perfectly resilient rerouting rules whenever it is. Our algorithm is also attractive for the simple structure of the rerouting rules it uses, known as skipping in the literature: alternative links are chosen according to an ordered priority list (per in-port), where failed links are simply skipped. Intriguingly, our result also implies that in the context of perfect resilience, skipping rerouting rules are as powerful as more general rerouting rules. This partially answers a long-standing open question by Chiesa, Nikolaevskiy, Mitrovic, Gurtov, Madry, Schapira, and Shenker [IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 2017] in the affirmative.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AutoFigure: Generating and Refining Publication-Ready Scientific Illustrations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03828</link><description>arXiv:2602.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that AutoFigure consistently surpasses all baseline methods, producing publication-ready scientific illustrations. The code, dataset and huggingface space are released in https://github.com/ResearAI/AutoFigure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03828v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating Scientific Research with Gemini: Case Studies and Common Techniques</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03837</link><description>arXiv:2602.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for accelerating scientific research. While models are increasingly capable of assisting with routine tasks, their ability to contribute to novel, expert-level mathematical discovery is less understood. We present a collection of case studies demonstrating how researchers have successfully collaborated with advanced AI models, specifically Google's Gemini-based models (in particular Gemini Deep Think and its advanced variants), to solve open problems, refute conjectures, and generate new proofs across diverse areas in theoretical computer science, as well as other areas such as economics, optimization, and physics. Based on these experiences, we extract common techniques for effective human-AI collaboration in theoretical research, such as iterative refinement, problem decomposition, and cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer. While the majority of our results stem from this interactive, conversational methodology, we also highlight specific instances that push beyond standard chat interfaces. These include deploying the model as a rigorous adversarial reviewer to detect subtle flaws in existing proofs, and embedding it within a "neuro-symbolic" loop that autonomously writes and executes code to verify complex derivations. Together, these examples highlight the potential of AI not just as a tool for automation, but as a versatile, genuine partner in the creative process of scientific discovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03837v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PrevizWhiz: Combining Rough 3D Scenes and 2D Video to Guide Generative Video Previsualization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03838</link><description>arXiv:2602.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pre-production, filmmakers and 3D animation experts must rapidly prototype ideas to explore a film's possibilities before fullscale production, yet conventional approaches involve trade-offs in efficiency and expressiveness. Hand-drawn storyboards often lack spatial precision needed for complex cinematography, while 3D previsualization demands expertise and high-quality rigged assets. To address this gap, we present PrevizWhiz, a system that leverages rough 3D scenes in combination with generative image and video models to create stylized video previews. The workflow integrates frame-level image restyling with adjustable resemblance, time-based editing through motion paths or external video inputs, and refinement into high-fidelity video clips. A study with filmmakers demonstrates that our system lowers technical barriers for film-makers, accelerates creative iteration, and effectively bridges the communication gap, while also surfacing challenges of continuity, authorship, and ethical consideration in AI-assisted filmmaking.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03838v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding and Exploiting Weight Update Sparsity for Communication-Efficient Distributed RL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03839</link><description>arXiv:2602.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component for post-training large language models (LLMs). However, in bandwidth-constrained distributed RL, scalability is often bottlenecked by the synchronization of policy weights from trainers to inference workers, particularly over commodity networks or in decentralized settings. While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We present a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at both step-level and multi-step granularities, examining its evolution across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. We find that update sparsity is consistently high, frequently exceeding 99% across practically relevant settings. Leveraging this structure, we propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), a simple yet highly efficient lossless weight synchronization method that transmits only the indices and values of modified parameters. PULSE is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift inherent in additive delta schemes. In bandwidth-constrained decentralized environments, our approach achieves over 100x (14 GB to ~108 MB) communication reduction while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization. By exploiting this structure, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing the bandwidth required for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s to maintain high GPU utilization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03839v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Investigating Quantum Circuit Designs Using Neuro-Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03840</link><description>arXiv:2602.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing effective quantum circuits remains a central challenge in quantum computing, as circuit structure strongly influences expressivity, trainability, and hardware feasibility. Current approaches, whether using manually designed circuit templates, fixed heuristics, or automated rules, face limitations in scalability, flexibility, and adaptability, often producing circuits that are poorly matched to the specific problem or quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Quantum Circuits (EXAQC), an evolutionary approach to the automated design and training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) which leverages and extends on strategies from neuroevolution and genetic programming. The proposed method jointly searches over gate types, qubit connectivity, parameterization, and circuit depth while respecting hardware and noise constraints. The method supports both Qiskit and Pennylane libraries, allowing the user to configure every aspect. This work highlights evolutionary search as a critical tool for advancing quantum machine learning and variational quantum algorithms, providing a principled pathway toward scalable, problem-aware, and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design. Preliminary results demonstrate that circuits evolved on classification tasks are able to achieve over 90% accuracy on most of the benchmark datasets with a limited computational budget, and are able to emulate target circuit quantum states with high fidelity scores.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03840v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parallel-Probe: Towards Efficient Parallel Thinking via 2D Probing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03845</link><description>arXiv:2602.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a promising paradigm for reasoning, yet it imposes significant computational burdens. Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches. We introduce 2D probing, an interface that exposes the width-depth dynamics of parallel thinking by periodically eliciting intermediate answers from all branches. Our analysis reveals three key insights: non-monotonic scaling across width-depth allocations, heterogeneous reasoning branch lengths, and early stabilization of global consensus. Guided by these insights, we introduce $\textbf{{Parallel-Probe}}$, a training-free controller designed to optimize online parallel thinking. Parallel-Probe employs consensus-based early stopping to regulate reasoning depth and deviation-based branch pruning to dynamically adjust width. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and multiple models demonstrate that Parallel-Probe establishes a superior Pareto frontier for test-time scaling. Compared to standard majority voting, it reduces sequential tokens by up to $\textbf{35.8}$% and total token cost by over $\textbf{25.8}$% while maintaining competitive accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PLATE: Plasticity-Tunable Efficient Adapters for Geometry-Aware Continual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03846</link><description>arXiv:2602.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continual learning method for pretrained models that \emph{requires no access to old-task data}, addressing a practical barrier in foundation model adaptation where pretraining distributions are often unavailable. Our key observation is that pretrained networks exhibit substantial \emph{geometric redundancy}, and that this redundancy can be exploited in two complementary ways. First, redundant neurons provide a proxy for dominant pretraining-era feature directions, enabling the construction of approximately protected update subspaces directly from pretrained weights. Second, redundancy offers a natural bias for \emph{where} to place plasticity: by restricting updates to a subset of redundant neurons and constraining the remaining degrees of freedom, we obtain update families with reduced functional drift on the old-data distribution and improved worst-case retention guarantees. These insights lead to \textsc{PLATE} (\textbf{Pla}sticity-\textbf{T}unable \textbf{E}fficient Adapters), a continual learning method requiring no past-task data that provides explicit control over the plasticity-retention trade-off. PLATE parameterizes each layer with a structured low-rank update $\Delta W = B A Q^\top$, where $B$ and $Q$ are computed once from pretrained weights and kept frozen, and only $A$ is trained on the new task.

Abstract: Event cameras offer a considerable alternative to RGB cameras in many scenarios.

To address this limitation, we present EventNeuS, a self-supervised neural model for learning 3D representations from monocular colour event streams. Our approach, for the first time, combines 3D signed distance function and density field learning with event-based supervision. Furthermore, we introduce spherical harmonics encodings into our model for enhanced handling of view-dependent effects. EventNeuS outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin, achieving 34% lower Chamfer distance and 31% lower mean absolute error on average compared to the best previous method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03847v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LPCVAE: A Conditional VAE with Long-Term Dependency and Probabilistic Time-Frequency Fusion for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10915</link><description>arXiv:2510.10915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE. LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.10915v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An algorithm for annihilator and Bernstein-Sato polynomial of a rational function</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00280</link><description>arXiv:2602.00280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The singularity theory of rational functions, i.e., the quotient of two polynomials, has been investigated in the past two decades. The Bernstein-Sato polynomial of a rational function has recently been introduced by Takeuchi. However, only trivial examples are known. We provide an algorithm for computing the Bernstein-Sato polynomial in this context. The strategy is to compute the annihilator of the rational function by using the annihilator of the pair consisting of the numerator and denominator of the quotient. In a natural way a non-vanishing condition on the Bernstein-Sato ideal of the pair appears. This method has been implemented in freely available computer algebra system SINGULAR. It relies on Gr\"obner bases in noncommutative PBW algebras. The algorithm allows us to exhibit some explicit non-trivial examples and to support some existing conjectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00280v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Joint single-shot ToA and DoA estimation for VAA-based BLE ranging with phase ambiguity: A deep learning-based approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02503</link><description>arXiv:2602.02503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation methods rely on multi-antenna arrays, which are costly to implement on size-constrained Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Virtual antenna array (VAA) techniques enable DoA estimation with a single antenna, making angle estimation feasible on such devices. However, BLE only provides a single-shot two-way channel frequency response (CFR) with a binary phase ambiguity issue, which hinders the direct application of VAA. To address this challenge, we propose a unified model that combines VAA with BLE two-way CFR, and introduce a neural network based phase recovery framework that employs row / column predictors with a voting mechanism to resolve the ambiguity. The recovered one-way CFR then enables super resolution algorithms such as MUSIC for joint time of arrival (ToA) and DoA estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under non-uniform VAAs, with mean square errors approaching the Cramer Rao bound at SNR $\geq$ 5 dB.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02503v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Super-r\'esolution non supervis\'ee d'images hyperspectrales de t\'el\'ed\'etection utilisant un entra\^inement enti\`erement synth\'etique</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02552</link><description>arXiv:2602.02552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving the rich spectral information of hyperspectral images. Most existing methods rely on supervised learning with high-resolution ground truth data, which is often unavailable in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose an unsupervised learning approach based on synthetic abundance data. The hyperspectral image is first decomposed into endmembers and abundance maps through hyperspectral unmixing. A neural network is then trained to super-resolve these maps using data generated with the dead leaves model, which replicates the statistical properties of real abundances. The final super-resolution hyperspectral image is reconstructed by recombining the super-resolved abundance maps with the endmembers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the relevance of synthetic data for training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02552v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Relaxed Triangle Inequality for Kullback-Leibler Divergence Between Multivariate Gaussian Distributions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02577</link><description>arXiv:2602.02577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is not a proper distance metric and does not satisfy the triangle inequality, posing theoretical challenges in certain practical applications. Existing work has demonstrated that KL divergence between multivariate Gaussian distributions follows a relaxed triangle inequality. Given any three multivariate Gaussian distributions $\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_2$, and $\mathcal{N}_3$, if $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_2)\leq \epsilon_1$ and $KL(\mathcal{N}_2, \mathcal{N}_3)\leq \epsilon_2$, then $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_3)&lt; 3\epsilon_1+3\epsilon_2+2\sqrt{\epsilon_1\epsilon_2}+o(\epsilon_1)+o(\epsilon_2)$. However, the supremum of $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_3)$ is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the relaxed triangle inequality for the KL divergence between multivariate Gaussian distributions and give the supremum of $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_3)$ as well as the conditions when the supremum can be attained. When $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ are small, the supremum is $\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2+\sqrt{\epsilon_1\epsilon_2}+o(\epsilon_1)+o(\epsilon_2)$. Finally, we demonstrate several applications of our results in out-of-distribution detection with flow-based generative models and safe reinforcement learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02577v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Evolution of Lying in a Spatially-Explicit Prisoner's Dilemma Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02587</link><description>arXiv:2602.02587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present the results from a spatial model of the prisoner's dilemma, played on a toroidal lattice. Each individual has a default strategy of either cooperating ($C$) or defecting ($D$). Two strategies were tested, including ``tit-for-tat'' (TFT), in which individuals play their opponent's last play, or simply playing their default play. Each individual also has a probability of telling the truth ($0 \leq P_{truth} \leq 1$) about their last play. This parameter, which can evolve over time, allows individuals to be, for instance, a defector but present as a cooperator regarding their last play. This leads to interesting dynamics where mixed populations of defectors and cooperators with $P_{truth} \geq 0.75$ move toward populations of truth-telling cooperators. Likewise, mixed populations with $P_{truth} &lt; 0.7$ become populations of lying defectors. Both such populations are stable because they each have higher average scores than populations with intermediate values of $P_{truth}$. Applications of this model are discussed with regards to both humans and animals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02587v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Social Catalysts, Not Moral Agents: The Illusion of Alignment in LLM Societies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02598</link><description>arXiv:2602.02598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems where collective cooperation is often threatened by the "Tragedy of the Commons." This study investigates the effectiveness of Anchoring Agents--pre-programmed altruistic entities--in fostering cooperation within a Public Goods Game (PGG). Using a full factorial design across three state-of-the-art LLMs, we analyzed both behavioral outcomes and internal reasoning chains. While Anchoring Agents successfully boosted local cooperation rates, cognitive decomposition and transfer tests revealed that this effect was driven by strategic compliance and cognitive offloading rather than genuine norm internalization. Notably, most agents reverted to self-interest in new environments, and advanced models like GPT-4.1 exhibited a "Chameleon Effect," masking strategic defection under public scrutiny. These findings highlight a critical gap between behavioral modification and authentic value alignment in artificial societies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02598v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EchoJEPA: A Latent Predictive Foundation Model for Echocardiography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02603</link><description>arXiv:2602.02603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for echocardiography promise to reduce annotation burden and improve diagnostic consistency by learning generalizable representations from large unlabeled video archives. However, current approaches fail to disentangle anatomical signal from the stochastic speckle and acquisition artifacts that dominate ultrasound imagery. We present EchoJEPA, a foundation model for echocardiography trained on 18 million echocardiograms across 300K patients, the largest pretraining corpus for this modality to date. We also introduce a novel multi-view probing framework with factorized stream embeddings that standardizes evaluation under frozen backbones. Compared to prior methods, EchoJEPA reduces left ventricular ejection fraction estimation error by 19% and achieves 87.4% view classification accuracy. EchoJEPA exhibits strong sample efficiency, reaching 78.6% accuracy with only 1% of labeled data versus 42.1% for the best baseline trained on 100%. Under acoustic perturbations, EchoJEPA degrades by only 2.3% compared to 16.8% for the next best model, and transfers zero-shot to pediatric patients with 15% lower error than the next best model, outperforming all fine-tuned baselines. These results establish latent prediction as a superior paradigm for ultrasound foundation models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02603v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI Assisted Economics Measurement From Survey: Evidence from Public Employee Pension Choice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02604</link><description>arXiv:2602.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an iterative framework for economic measurement that leverages large language models to extract measurement structure directly from survey instruments. The approach maps survey items to a sparse distribution over latent constructs through what we term a soft mapping, aggregates harmonized responses into respondent level sub dimension scores, and disciplines the resulting taxonomy through out of sample incremental validity tests and discriminant validity diagnostics. The framework explicitly integrates iteration into the measurement construction process. Overlap and redundancy diagnostics trigger targeted taxonomy refinement and constrained remapping, ensuring that added measurement flexibility is retained only when it delivers stable out of sample performance gains. Applied to a large scale public employee retirement plan survey, the framework identifies which semantic components contain behavioral signal and clarifies the economic mechanisms, such as beliefs versus constraints, that matter for retirement choices. The methodology provides a portable measurement audit of survey instruments that can guide both empirical analysis and survey design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02604v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CryoLVM: Self-supervised Learning from Cryo-EM Density Maps with Large Vision Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02620</link><description>arXiv:2602.02620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized structural biology by enabling near-atomic-level visualization of biomolecular assemblies. However, the exponential growth in cryo-EM data throughput and complexity, coupled with diverse downstream analytical tasks, necessitates unified computational frameworks that transcend current task-specific deep learning approaches with limited scalability and generalizability. We present CryoLVM, a foundation model that learns rich structural representations from experimental density maps with resolved structures by leveraging the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) integrated with SCUNet-based backbone, which can be rapidly adapted to various downstream tasks. We further introduce a novel histogram-based distribution alignment loss that accelerates convergence and enhances fine-tuning performance. We demonstrate CryoLVM's effectiveness across three critical cryo-EM tasks: density map sharpening, density map super-resolution, and missing wedge restoration. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple density map quality metrics, confirming its potential as a versatile model for a wide spectrum of cryo-EM applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02620v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Test-Time Training: Tilting The Latent Distribution For Few-Shot Source-Free Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02633</link><description>arXiv:2602.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Often, constraints arise in deployment settings where even lightweight parameter updates e.g. parameter-efficient fine-tuning could induce model shift or tuning instability. We study test-time adaptation of foundation models for few-shot classification under a completely frozen-model regime, where additionally, no upstream data are accessible. We propose arguably the first training-free inference method that adapts predictions to the new task by performing a change of measure over the latent embedding distribution induced by the encoder. Using task-similarity scores derived from a small labeled support set, exponential tilting reweights latent distributions in a KL-optimal manner without modifying model parameters. Empirically, the method consistently competes with parameter-update-based methods across multiple benchmarks and shot regimes, while operating under strictly and universally stronger constraints. These results demonstrate the viability of inference-level distributional correction for test-time adaptation even with a fully-frozen model pipeline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02633v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Compiling Quantum Regular Language States</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02698</link><description>arXiv:2602.02698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State preparation compilers for quantum computers typically sit at two extremes: general-purpose routines that treat the target as an opaque amplitude vector, and bespoke constructions for a handful of well-known state families. We ask whether a compiler can instead accept simple, structure-aware specifications while providing predictable resource guarantees. We answer this by designing and implementing a quantum state-preparation compiler for regular language states (RLS): uniform superpositions over bitstrings accepted by a regular description, and their complements. Users describe the target state via (i) a finite set of bitstrings, (ii) a regular expression, or (iii) a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), optionally with a complement flag. By translating the input to a DFA, minimizing it, and mapping it to an optimal matrix product state (MPS), the compiler obtains an intermediate representation (IR) that exposes and compresses hidden structure. The efficient DFA representation and minimization offloads expensive linear algebra computation in exchange of simpler automata manipulations. The combination of the regular-language frontend and this IR gives concise specifications not only for RLS but also for their complements that might otherwise require exponentially large state descriptions. This enables state preparation of an RLS or its complement with the same asymptotic resources and compile time. We outline two hardware-aware backends: SeqRLSP, which yields linear-depth, ancilla-free circuits for linear nearest-neighbor architectures via sequential generation, and TreeRLSP, which achieves logarithmic depth on all-to-all connectivity via a tree tensor network. We prove depth and gate-count bounds scaling with the system size and the state's maximal Schmidt rank, and we give explicit compile-time bounds that expose the benefit of our approach. We implement and evaluate the pipeline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02698v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Perfusion Imaging and Single Material Reconstruction in Polychromatic Photon Counting CT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02713</link><description>arXiv:2602.02713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Perfusion computed tomography (CT) images the dynamics of a contrast agent through the body over time, and is one of the highest X-ray dose scans in medical imaging. Recently, a theoretically justified reconstruction algorithm based on a monotone variational inequality (VI) was proposed for single material polychromatic photon-counting CT, and showed promising early results at low-dose imaging.
  Purpose: We adapt this reconstruction algorithm for perfusion CT, to reconstruct the concentration map of the contrast agent while the static background tissue is assumed known; we call our method VI-PRISM (VI-based PeRfusion Imaging and Single Material reconstruction). We evaluate its potential for dose-reduced perfusion CT, using a digital phantom with water and iodine of varying concentration.
  Methods: Simulated iodine concentrations range from 0.05 to 2.5 mg/ml. The simulated X-ray source emits photons up to 100 keV, with average intensity ranging from $10^5$ down to $10^2$ photons per detector element. The number of tomographic projections was varied from 984 down to 8 to characterize the tradeoff in photon allocation between views and intensity.
  Results: We compare VI-PRISM against filtered back-projection (FBP), and find that VI-PRISM recovers iodine concentration with error below 0.4 mg/ml at all source intensity levels tested. Even with a dose reduction between 10x and 100x compared to FBP, VI-PRISM exhibits reconstruction quality on par with FBP.
  Conclusion: Across all photon budgets and angular sampling densities tested, VI-PRISM achieved consistently lower RMSE, reduced noise, and higher SNR compared to filtered back-projection. Even in extremely photon-limited and sparsely sampled regimes, VI-PRISM recovered iodine concentrations with errors below 0.4 mg/ml, showing that VI-PRISM can support accurate and dose-efficient perfusion imaging in photon-counting CT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02713v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WAXAL: A Large-Scale Multilingual African Language Speech Corpus</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02734</link><description>arXiv:2602.02734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of speech technology has predominantly favored high-resource languages, creating a significant digital divide for speakers of most Sub-Saharan African languages. To address this gap, we introduce WAXAL, a large-scale, openly accessible speech dataset for 21 languages representing over 100 million speakers. The collection consists of two main components: an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset containing approximately 1,250 hours of transcribed, natural speech from a diverse range of speakers, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) dataset with over 180 hours of high-quality, single-speaker recordings reading phonetically balanced scripts. This paper details our methodology for data collection, annotation, and quality control, which involved partnerships with four African academic and community organizations. We provide a detailed statistical overview of the dataset and discuss its potential limitations and ethical considerations. The WAXAL datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/WaxalNLP under the permissive CC-BY-4.0 license to catalyze research, enable the development of inclusive technologies, and serve as a vital resource for the digital preservation of these languages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02734v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physics-based generation of multilayer corneal OCT data via Gaussian modeling and MCML for AI-driven diagnostic and surgical guidance applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02755</link><description>arXiv:2602.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training deep learning models for corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging is limited by the availability of large, well-annotated datasets. We present a configurable Monte Carlo simulation framework that generates synthetic corneal B-scan optical OCT images with pixel-level five-layer segmentation labels derived directly from the simulation geometry. A five-layer corneal model with Gaussian surfaces captures curvature and thickness variability in healthy and keratoconic eyes. Each layer is assigned optical properties from the literature and light transport is simulated using Monte Carlo modeling of light transport in multi-layered tissues (MCML), while incorporating system features such as the confocal PSF and sensitivity roll-off. This approach produces over 10,000 high-resolution (1024x1024) image-label pairs and supports customization of geometry, photon count, noise, and system parameters. The resulting dataset enables systematic training, validation, and benchmarking of AI models under controlled, ground-truth conditions, providing a reproducible and scalable resource to support the development of diagnostic and surgical guidance applications in image-guided ophthalmology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02755v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Plug-In Classification of Drift Functions in Diffusion Processes Using Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02791</link><description>arXiv:2602.02791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a supervised multiclass classification problem for diffusion processes, where each class is characterized by a distinct drift function and trajectories are observed at discrete times. Extending the one-dimensional multiclass framework of Denis et al. (2024) to multidimensional diffusions, we propose a neural network-based plug-in classifier that estimates the drift functions for each class from independent sample paths and assigns labels based on a Bayes-type decision rule. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish convergence rates for the excess misclassification risk, explicitly capturing the effects of drift estimation error and time discretization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster convergence and improved classification performance compared to Denis et al. (2024) in the one-dimensional setting, remains effective in higher dimensions when the underlying drift functions admit a compositional structure, and consistently outperforms direct neural network classifiers trained end-to-end on trajectories without exploiting the diffusion model structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02791v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Well-Being with Mobile Phone Data: Evidence from Four Countries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02805</link><description>arXiv:2602.02805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide systematic evidence on the potential for estimating household well-being from mobile phone data. Using data from four countries - Afghanistan, Cote d'Ivoire, Malawi, and Togo - we conduct parallel, standardized machine learning experiments to assess which measures of welfare can be most accurately predicted, which types of phone data are most useful, and how much training data is required. We find that long-term poverty measures such as wealth indices (Pearson's rho = 0.20-0.59) and multidimensional poverty (rho = 0.29-0.57) can be predicted more accurately than consumption (rho = 0.04 - 0.54); transient vulnerability measures like food security and mental health are very difficult to predict. Models using calls and text message behavior are more predictive than those using metadata on mobile internet usage, mobile money transactions, and airtime top-ups. Predictive accuracy improves rapidly through the first 1,000-2,000 training observations, with continued gains beyond 4,500 observations. Model performance depends strongly on sample heterogeneity: nationally-representative samples yield 20-70 percent higher accuracy than urban-only or rural-only samples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02805v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Downscaling land surface temperature data using edge detection and block-diagonal Gaussian process regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02813</link><description>arXiv:2602.02813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution estimation of land surface temperature (LST) is crucial in estimating evapotranspiration, a measure of plant water use and a central quantity in agricultural applications. In this work, we develop a novel statistical method for downscaling LST data obtained from NASA's ECOSTRESS mission, using high-resolution data from the Landsat 8 mission as a proxy for modeling agricultural field structure. Using the Landsat data, we identify the boundaries of agricultural fields through edge detection techniques, allowing us to capture the inherent block structure present in the spatial domain. We propose a block-diagonal Gaussian process (BDGP) model that captures the spatial structure of the agricultural fields, leverages independence of LST across fields for computational tractability, and accounts for the change of support present in ECOSTRESS observations. We use the resulting BDGP model to perform Gaussian process regression and obtain high-resolution estimates of LST from ECOSTRESS data, along with uncertainty quantification. Our results demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method in producing reliable high-resolution LST estimates, with potential applications in agriculture, urban planning, and climate studies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02813v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sub-optimality bounds for certainty equivalent policies in partially observed systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02814</link><description>arXiv:2602.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalization of the certainty equivalence principle of stochastic control. One interpretation of the classical certainty equivalence principle for linear systems with output feedback and quadratic costs is as follows: the optimal action at each time is obtained by evaluating the optimal state-feedback policy of the stochastic linear system at the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate of the state. Motivated by this interpretation, we consider certainty equivalent policies for general (non-linear) partially observed stochastic systems that allow for any state estimate rather than restricting to MMSE estimates. In such settings, the certainty equivalent policy is not optimal. For models where the cost and the dynamics are smooth in an appropriate sense, we derive upper bounds on the sub-optimality of certainty equivalent policies. We present several examples to illustrate the results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02814v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast Near Time-Optimal Motion Planning for Holonomic Vehicles in Structured Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02826</link><description>arXiv:2602.02826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and efficient optimization-based method for generating near time-optimal trajectories for holonomic vehicles navigating through complex but structured environments. The approach aims to solve the problem of motion planning for planar motion systems using magnetic levitation that can be used in assembly lines, automated laboratories or clean-rooms. In these applications, time-optimal trajectories that can be computed in real-time are required to increase productivity and allow the vehicles to be reactive if needed. The presented approach encodes the environment representation using free-space corridors and represents the motion of the vehicle through such a corridor using a motion primitive. These primitives are selected heuristically and define the trajectory with a limited number of degrees of freedom, which are determined in an optimization problem. As a result, the method achieves significantly lower computation times compared to the state-of-the-art, most notably solving a full Optimal Control Problem (OCP), OMG-tools or VP-STO without significantly compromising optimality within a fixed corridor sequence. The approach is benchmarked extensively in simulation and is validated on a real-world Beckhoff XPlanar system</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02826v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training-Free Self-Correction for Multimodal Masked Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02927</link><description>arXiv:2602.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for text and multimodal generation. However, their sampling procedure updates multiple tokens simultaneously and treats generated tokens as immutable, which may lead to error accumulation when early mistakes cannot be revised. In this work, we revisit existing self-correction methods and identify limitations stemming from additional training requirements or reliance on misaligned likelihood estimates. We propose a training-free self-correction framework that exploits the inductive biases of pre-trained masked diffusion models. Without modifying model parameters or introducing auxiliary evaluators, our method significantly improves generation quality on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding tasks with reduced sampling steps. Moreover, the proposed framework generalizes across different masked diffusion architectures, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Clustered data, which arise when observations are nested within groups, are incredibly common in clinical, education, and social science research. Traditionally, a linear mixed model, which includes random effects to account for within-group correlation, would be used to model the observed data and make new predictions on unseen data. Some work has been done to extend the mixed model approach beyond linear regression into more complex and non-parametric models, such as decision trees and random forests. However, existing methods are limited to using the global fixed effects for prediction on data from out-of-sample groups, effectively assuming that all clusters share a common outcome model. We propose a lightweight sum-of-trees model in which we learn a decision tree for each sample group. We combine the predictions from these trees using weights so that out-of-sample group predictions are more closely aligned with the most similar groups in the training data. This strategy also allows for inference on the similarity across groups in the outcome prediction model, as the unique tree structures and variable importances for each group can be directly compared. We show our model outperforms traditional decision trees and random forests in a variety of simulation settings. Finally, we showcase our method on real-world data from the sarcoma cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas, where patient samples are grouped by sarcoma subtype.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02931v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A vector logic for intensional formal semantics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02940</link><description>arXiv:2602.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal semantics and distributional semantics are distinct approaches to linguistic meaning: the former models meaning as reference via model-theoretic structures; the latter represents meaning as vectors in high-dimensional spaces shaped by usage. This paper proves that these frameworks are structurally compatible for intensional semantics. We establish that Kripke-style intensional models embed injectively into vector spaces, with semantic functions lifting to (multi)linear maps that preserve composition. The construction accommodates multiple index sorts (worlds, times, locations) via a compound index space, representing intensions as linear operators. Modal operators are derived algebraically: accessibility relations become linear operators, and modal conditions reduce to threshold checks on accumulated values. For uncountable index domains, we develop a measure-theoretic generalization in which necessity becomes truth almost everywhere and possibility becomes truth on a set of positive measure, a non-classical logic natural for continuous parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Methods for the Navier-Stokes Equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02945</link><description>arXiv:2602.02945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Bayesian methodology for numerical solution of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with quantified uncertainty. The central idea is to treat discretized Navier--Stokes dynamics as a state-space model and to view numerical solution as posterior computation: priors encode physical structure and modeling error, and the solver outputs a distribution over states and quantities of interest rather than a single trajectory. In two dimensions, stochastic representations (Feynman--Kac and stochastic characteristics for linear advection--diffusion with prescribed drift) motivate Monte Carlo solvers and provide intuition for uncertainty propagation. In three dimensions, we formulate stochastic Navier--Stokes models and describe particle-based and ensemble-based Bayesian workflows for uncertainty propagation in spectral discretizations. A key computational advantage is that parameter learning can be performed stably via particle learning: marginalization and resample--propagate (one-step smoothing) constructions avoid the weight-collapse that plagues naive sequential importance sampling on static parameters. When partial observations are available, the same machinery supports sequential observational updating as an additional capability. We also discuss non-Gaussian (heavy-tailed) error models based on normal variance-mean mixtures, which yield conditionally Gaussian updates via latent scale augmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02945v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Asymptotically Optimal Quantum Universal Quickest Change Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02950</link><description>arXiv:2602.02950v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Designing front-ends for speech deepfake detectors primarily focuses on two categories. Hand-crafted filterbank features are transparent but are limited in capturing high-level semantic details, often resulting in performance gaps compared to self-supervised (SSL) features. SSL features, in turn, lack interpretability and may overlook fine-grained spectral anomalies. We propose the WST-X series, a novel family of feature extractors that combines the best of both worlds via the wavelet scattering transform (WST), integrating wavelets with nonlinearities analogous to deep convolutional networks. We investigate 1D and 2D WSTs to extract acoustic details and higher-order structural anomalies, respectively. Experimental results on the recent and challenging Deepfake-Eval-2024 dataset indicate that WST-X outperforms existing front-ends by a wide margin. Our analysis reveals that a small averaging scale ($J$), combined with high-frequency and directional resolutions ($Q, L$), is critical for capturing subtle artifacts. This underscores the value of translation-invariant and deformation-stable features for robust and interpretable speech deepfake detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02980v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fisher-Information-Based Sensor Placement for Structural Digital Twins: Analytic Results and Benchmarks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02981</link><description>arXiv:2602.02981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity digital twins rely on the accurate assimilation of sensor data into physics-based computational models. In structural applications, such twins aim to identify spatially distributed quantities--such as elementwise weakening fields, material parameters, or effective thermal loads--by minimizing discrepancies between measured and simulated responses subject to the governing equations of structural mechanics. While adjoint-based methods enable efficient gradient computation for these inverse problems, the quality and stability of the resulting estimates depend critically on the choice of sensor locations, measurement types, and directions.
  This paper develops a rigorous and implementation-ready framework for Fisher-information-based sensor placement in adjoint-based finite-element digital twins. Sensor configurations are evaluated using a D-optimal design criterion derived from a linearization of the measurement map, yielding a statistically meaningful measure of information content. We present matrix-free operator formulas for applying the Jacobian and its adjoint, and hence for computing Fisher-information products $Fv = J^\top R^{-1} Jv$ using only forward and adjoint solves. Building on these operator evaluations, we derive explicit sensitivity expressions for D-optimal sensor design with respect to measurement parameters and discuss practical strategies for evaluating the associated log-determinant objectives. To complement the general framework, we provide analytically tractable sensor placement results for a canonical one-dimensional structural model, clarifying the distinction between detectability and localizability and proving that D-optimal placement of multiple displacement sensors yields approximately uniform spacing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02981v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating the Tesseract Decoder for Quantum Error Correction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02985</link><description>arXiv:2602.02985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for building robust, fault-tolerant quantum computers; however, the decoding process often presents a significant computational bottleneck. Tesseract is a novel Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoder for QEC that employs the A* search algorithm to explore an exponentially large graph of error hypotheses, achieving high decoding speed and accuracy. This paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing the Tesseract decoder through low-level performance enhancements. Based on extensive profiling, we implemented four targeted optimization strategies, including the replacement of inefficient data structures, reorganization of memory layouts to improve cache hit rates, and the use of hardware-accelerated bit-wise operations. We achieved significant decoding speedups across a wide range of code families and configurations, including Color Codes, Bivariate-Bicycle Codes, Surface Codes, and Transversal CNOT Protocols. Our results demonstrate consistent speedups of approximately 2x for most code families, often exceeding 2.5x. Notably, we achieved a peak performance gain of over 5x for the most computationally demanding configurations of Bivariate-Bicycle Codes. These improvements make the Tesseract decoder more efficient and scalable, serving as a practical case study that highlights the importance of high-performance software engineering in QEC and providing a strong foundation for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02985v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-driven stabilization of continuous-time systems with noisy input-output data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02992</link><description>arXiv:2602.02992v1 Announce Type: cross

Next, combining this characterization with behavioral theory, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the noisy data to be informative for quadratic stabilization. This condition is formulated as linear matrix inequalities, whose solution yields a stabilizing controller. Finally, we characterize data informativity for system identification in the noise-free setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02992v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physics-inspired transformer quantum states via latent imaginary-time evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03031</link><description>arXiv:2602.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful ans\"atze in the variational Monte Carlo framework, yet their architectures are often treated as black boxes. We propose a physically transparent framework in which NQS are treated as neural approximations to latent imaginary-time evolution. This viewpoint suggests that standard Transformer-based NQS (TQS) architectures correspond to physically unmotivated effective Hamiltonians dependent on imaginary time in a latent space. Building on this interpretation, we introduce physics-inspired transformer quantum states (PITQS), which enforce a static effective Hamiltonian by sharing weights across layers and improve propagation accuracy via Trotter-Suzuki decompositions without increasing the number of variational parameters. For the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, our ans\"atze achieve accuracies comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art TQS while using substantially fewer variational parameters. This study demonstrates that reinterpreting the deep network structure as a latent cooling process enables a more physically grounded, systematic, and compact design, thereby bridging the gap between black-box expressivity and physically transparent construction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03031v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unified Inference Framework for Single and Multi-Player Performative Prediction: Method and Asymptotic Optimality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03049</link><description>arXiv:2602.03049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performative prediction characterizes environments where predictive models alter the very data distributions they aim to forecast, triggering complex feedback loops. While prior research treats single-agent and multi-agent performativity as distinct phenomena, this paper introduces a unified statistical inference framework that bridges these contexts, treating the former as a special case of the latter. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we put forward the Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM) procedure for estimating the performative stability, and establish a rigorous inferential theory for admitting its asymptotic normality and confirming its asymptotic efficiency. Second, for the performative optimality, we introduce a novel two-step plug-in estimator that integrates the idea of Recalibrated Prediction Powered Inference (RePPI) with Importance Sampling, and further provide formal derivations for the Central Limit Theorems of both the underlying distributional parameters and the plug-in results. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that our estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound and maintains robustness under mild distributional misspecification. This work provides a principled toolkit for reliable estimation and decision-making in dynamic, performative environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Online Conformal Prediction via Universal Portfolio Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03168</link><description>arXiv:2602.03168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online conformal prediction (OCP) seeks prediction intervals that achieve long-run $1-\alpha$ coverage for arbitrary (possibly adversarial) data streams, while remaining as informative as possible. Existing OCP methods often require manual learning-rate tuning to work well, and may also require algorithm-specific analyses. Here, we develop a general regret-to-coverage theory for interval-valued OCP based on the $(1-\alpha)$-pinball loss. Our first contribution is to identify \emph{linearized regret} as a key notion, showing that controlling it implies coverage bounds for any online algorithm. This relies on a black-box reduction that depends only on the Fenchel conjugate of an upper bound on the linearized regret. Building on this theory, we propose UP-OCP, a parameter-free method for OCP, via a reduction to a two-asset portfolio selection problem, leveraging universal portfolio algorithms. We show strong finite-time bounds on the miscoverage of UP-OCP, even for polynomially growing predictions. Extensive experiments support that UP-OCP delivers consistently better size/coverage trade-offs than prior online conformal baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03168v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NeuralFLoC: Neural Flow-Based Joint Registration and Clustering of Functional Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03169</link><description>arXiv:2602.03169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering functional data in the presence of phase variation is challenging, as temporal misalignment can obscure intrinsic shape differences and degrade clustering performance. Most existing approaches treat registration and clustering as separate tasks or rely on restrictive parametric assumptions. We present \textbf{NeuralFLoC}, a fully unsupervised, end-to-end deep learning framework for joint functional registration and clustering based on Neural ODE-driven diffeomorphic flows and spectral clustering. The proposed model learns smooth, invertible warping functions and cluster-specific templates simultaneously, effectively disentangling phase and amplitude variation. We establish universal approximation guarantees and asymptotic consistency for the proposed framework. Experiments on functional benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance in both registration and clustering, with robustness to missing data, irregular sampling, and noise, while maintaining scalability.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of tacrolimus exposure, quantified by the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), is essential for precision dosing after renal transplantation. Current practice relies on population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models based on nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) methods. However, these models depend on rigid, pre-specified assumptions and may struggle to capture complex, patient-specific dynamics, leading to model misspecification.
  In this study, we introduce a novel data-driven alternative based on Latent Ordinary Differential Equations (Latent ODEs) for tacrolimus AUC prediction. This deep learning approach learns individualized pharmacokinetic dynamics directly from sparse clinical data, enabling greater flexibility in modeling complex biological behavior. The model was evaluated through extensive simulations across multiple scenarios and benchmarked against two standard approaches: NLME-based estimation and the iterative two-stage Bayesian (it2B) method. We further performed a rigorous clinical validation using a development dataset (n = 178) and a completely independent external dataset (n = 75).
  In simulation, the Latent ODE model demonstrated superior robustness, maintaining high accuracy even when underlying biological mechanisms deviated from standard assumptions. Regarding experiments on clinical datasets, in internal validation, it achieved significantly higher precision with a mean RMSPE of 7.99% compared with 9.24% for it2B (p &lt; 0.001). On the external cohort, it achieved an RMSPE of 10.82%, comparable to the two standard estimators (11.48% and 11.54%).
  These results establish the Latent ODE as a powerful and reliable tool for AUC prediction. Its flexible architecture provides a promising foundation for next-generation, multi-modal models in personalized medicine.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03215v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Estimating measures of information processing during cognitive tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03240</link><description>arXiv:2602.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognition is increasingly framed in terms of information processing, yet most fMRI analyses focus on activation or functional connectivity rather than quantifying how information is stored and transferred. To remedy this problem, we propose a framework for estimating measures of information processing: active information storage (AIS), transfer entropy (TE), and net synergy from task-based fMRI. AIS measures information maintained within a region, TE captures directed information flow, and net synergy contrasts higher-order synergistic to redundant interactions. Crucially, to enable this framework we utilised a recently developed approach for calculating information-theoretic measures: the cross mutual information. This approach combines resting-state and task data to address the challenges of limited sample size, non-stationarity and context in task-based fMRI. We applied this framework to the working memory (N-back) task from the Human Connectome Project (470 participants). Results show that AIS increases in fronto-parietal regions with working memory load, TE reveals enhanced directed information flows across control pathways, and net synergy indicates a global shift to redundancy. This work establishes a novel methodology for quantifying information processing in task-based fMRI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03240v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Orthogonal Approximate Message Passing Algorithms for Rectangular Spiked Matrix Models with Rotationally Invariant Noise</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03283</link><description>arXiv:2602.03283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm for signal estimation in the rectangular spiked matrix model with general rotationally invariant (RI) noise. We establish a rigorous state evolution that exactly characterizes the high-dimensional dynamics of the algorithm. Building on this framework, we derive an optimal variant of OAMP that minimizes the predicted mean-squared error at each iteration. For the special case of i.i.d. Gaussian noise, the fixed point of the proposed OAMP algorithm coincides with that of the standard AMP algorithm. For general RI noise models, we conjecture that the optimal OAMP algorithm is statistically optimal within a broad class of iterative methods, and achieves Bayes-optimal performance in certain regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03283v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multiparameter Uncertainty Mapping in Quantitative Molecular MRI using a Physics-Structured Variational Autoencoder (PS-VAE)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03317</link><description>arXiv:2602.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), aim to extract interpretable pathology biomarkers by estimating biophysical tissue parameters from signal evolutions. However, the pattern-matching algorithms or neural networks used in such inverse problems often lack principled uncertainty quantification, which limits the trustworthiness and transparency, required for clinical acceptance. Here, we describe a physics-structured variational autoencoder (PS-VAE) designed for rapid extraction of voxelwise multi-parameter posterior distributions. Our approach integrates a differentiable spin physics simulator with self-supervised learning, and provides a full covariance that captures the inter-parameter correlations of the latent biophysical space. The method was validated in a multi-proton pool chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) molecular MRF study, across in-vitro phantoms, tumor-bearing mice, healthy human volunteers, and a subject with glioblastoma. The resulting multi-parametric posteriors are in good agreement with those calculated using a brute-force Bayesian analysis, while providing an orders-of-magnitude acceleration in whole brain quantification. In addition, we demonstrate how monitoring the multi-parameter posterior dynamics across progressively acquired signals provides practical insights for protocol optimization and may facilitate real-time adaptive acquisition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03317v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Novel approach to portfolio construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03325</link><description>arXiv:2602.03325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for asset selection and portfolio construction, termed the Best-Path Algorithm Sparse Graphical Model (BPASGM). The method extends the Best-Path Algorithm (BPA) by mapping linear and non-linear dependencies among a large set of financial assets into a sparse graphical model satisfying a structural Markov property. Based on this representation, BPASGM performs a dependence-driven screening that removes positively or redundantly connected assets, isolating subsets that are conditionally independent or negatively correlated. This step is designed to enhance diversification and reduce estimation error in high-dimensional portfolio settings. Portfolio optimization is then conducted on the selected subset using standard mean-variance techniques. BPASGM does not aim to improve the theoretical mean-variance optimum under known population parameters, but rather to enhance realized performance in finite samples, where sample-based Markowitz portfolios are highly sensitive to estimation error. Monte Carlo simulations show that BPASGM-based portfolios achieve more stable risk-return profiles, lower realized volatility, and superior risk-adjusted performance compared to standard mean-variance portfolios. Empirical results for U.S. equities, global stock indices, and foreign exchange rates over 1990-2025 confirm these findings and demonstrate a substantial reduction in portfolio cardinality. Overall, BPASGM offers a statistically grounded and computationally efficient framework that integrates sparse graphical modeling with portfolio theory for dependence-aware asset selection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03325v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving the Linearized Laplace Approximation via Quadratic Approximations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03394</link><description>arXiv:2602.03394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident out-of-distribution predictions, motivating Bayesian uncertainty quantification. The Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA) achieves this by linearizing the DNN and applying Laplace inference to the resulting model. Importantly, the linear model is also used for prediction. We argue this linearization in the posterior may degrade fidelity to the true Laplace approximation. To alleviate this problem, without increasing significantly the computational cost, we propose the Quadratic Laplace Approximation (QLA). QLA approximates each second order factor in the approximate Laplace log-posterior using a rank-one factor obtained via efficient power iterations. QLA is expected to yield a posterior precision closer to that of the full Laplace without forming the full Hessian, which is typically intractable. For prediction, QLA also uses the linearized model. Empirically, QLA yields modest yet consistent uncertainty estimation improvements over LLA on five regression datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03394v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Quantum Diffusion Models for Complex Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03405</link><description>arXiv:2602.03405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum generative models offer a novel approach to exploring high-dimensional Hilbert spaces but face significant challenges in scalability and expressibility when applied to multi-modal distributions. In this study, we explore a Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net architecture integrated with Adaptive Non-Local Observables (ANO) as a potential solution to these hurdles. By compressing classical data into a dense quantum latent space and utilizing trainable observables, our model aims to extract non-local features that complement classical processing. We also investigate the role of Skip Connections in preserving semantic information during the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results on the full MNIST dataset (digits 0-9) demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating structurally coherent and recognizable images for all digit classes. While hardware constraints still impose limitations on resolution, our findings suggest that hybrid architectures with adaptive measurements provide a feasible pathway for mitigating mode collapse and enhancing generative capabilities in the NISQ era.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03405v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Acceleration of Atomistic NEGF: Algorithms, Parallelization, and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03438</link><description>arXiv:2602.03438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a particularly powerful method to simulate the quantum transport properties of nanoscale devices such as transistors, photo-diodes, or memory cells, in the ballistic limit of transport or in the presence of various scattering sources such as electronphonon, electron-photon, or even electron-electron interactions. The inclusion of all these mechanisms has been first demonstrated in small systems, composed of a few atoms, before being scaled up to larger structures made of thousands of atoms. Also, the accuracy of the models has kept improving, from empirical to fully ab-initio ones, e.g., density functional theory (DFT). This paper summarizes key (algorithmic) achievements that have allowed us to bring DFT+NEGF simulations closer to the dimensions and functionality of realistic systems. The possibility of leveraging graph neural networks and machine learning to speed up ab-initio device simulations is discussed as well.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Score-based diffusion models for diffuse optical tomography with uncertainty quantification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03449</link><description>arXiv:2602.03449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models are a recently developed framework for posterior sampling in Bayesian inverse problems with a state-of-the-art performance for severely ill-posed problems by leveraging a powerful prior distribution learned from empirical data. Despite generating significant interest especially in the machine-learning community, a thorough study of realistic inverse problems in the presence of modelling error and utilization of physical measurement data is still outstanding. In this work, the framework of unconditional representation for the conditional score function (UCoS) is evaluated for linearized difference imaging in diffuse optical tomography (DOT). DOT uses boundary measurements of near-infrared light to estimate the spatial distribution of absorption and scattering parameters in biological tissues. The problem is highly ill-posed and thus sensitive to noise and modelling errors. We introduce a novel regularization approach that prevents overfitting of the score function by constructing a mixed score composed of a learned and a model-based component. Validation of this approach is done using both simulated and experimental measurement data. The experiments demonstrate that a data-driven prior distribution results in posterior samples with low variance, compared to classical model-based estimation, and centred around the ground truth, even in the context of a highly ill-posed problem and in the presence of modelling errors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03449v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cholesky factorisation, and intrinsically sparse linear quadratic regulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03460</link><description>arXiv:2602.03460v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: It is intuitive and well known, that if agents in a multi-agent system iteratively update their states in the Euclidean space as convex combinations of neighbors' states, all states eventually converge to the same value (consensus), provided the interaction graph is sufficiently connected. However, this seems to be also true in practice if the convex combinations of states are mapped or radially projected onto any unit $l_p$-sphere or even boundaries of star-convex sets, herein referred to as star boundaries. In this paper, we present insight into this matter by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic consensus of the normalized states (directions) for strongly connected directed graphs, which is equivalent to asymptotic consensus of states when the star boundaries are the same for all agents. Furthermore, we show that when asymptotic consensus occurs, the states converge linearly and the point of convergence is continuous in the initial states. Assuming a directed strongly connected graph provides a more general setting than that considered, for example, in gradient-based consensus protocols, where symmetric graphs are assumed. Illustrative examples and a vast number of numerical simulations showcase the theoretical results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03508v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generator-based Graph Generation via Heat Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03612</link><description>arXiv:2602.03612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph generative modelling has become an essential task due to the wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, social networks, and knowledge representation. In this work, we propose a novel framework for generating graphs by adapting the Generator Matching (arXiv:2410.20587) paradigm to graph-structured data. We leverage the graph Laplacian and its associated heat kernel to define a continous-time diffusion on each graph. The Laplacian serves as the infinitesimal generator of this diffusion, and its heat kernel provides a family of conditional perturbations of the initial graph. A neural network is trained to match this generator by minimising a Bregman divergence between the true generator and a learnable surrogate. Once trained, the surrogate generator is used to simulate a time-reversed diffusion process to sample new graph structures. Our framework unifies and generalises existing diffusion-based graph generative models, injecting domain-specific inductive bias via the Laplacian, while retaining the flexibility of neural approximators. Experimental studies demonstrate that our approach captures structural properties of real and synthetic graphs effectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03612v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simulation-Based Inference via Regression Projection and Batched Discrepancies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03613</link><description>arXiv:2602.03613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a lightweight simulation-based inference method that infers simulator parameters using only a regression-based projection of the observed data. After fitting a surrogate linear regression once, the procedure simulates small batches at the proposed parameter values and assigns kernel weights based on the resulting batch-residual discrepancy, producing a self-normalized pseudo-posterior that is simple, parallelizable, and requires access only to the fitted regression coefficients rather than raw observations. We formalize the construction as an importance-sampling approximation to a population target that averages over simulator randomness, prove consistency as the number of parameter draws grows, and establish stability in estimating the surrogate regression from finite samples. We then characterize the asymptotic concentration as the batch size increases and the bandwidth shrinks, showing that the pseudo-posterior concentrates on an identified set determined by the chosen projection, thereby clarifying when the method yields point versus set identification. Experiments on a tractable nonlinear model and on a cosmological calibration task using the DREAMS simulation suite illustrate the computational advantages of regression-based projections and the identifiability limitations arising from low-information summaries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03613v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Noisy nonlocal aggregation model with gradient flow structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03654</link><description>arXiv:2602.03654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems provide a fundamental framework for modeling collective behavior in biological, social, and physical systems. In many applications, stochastic perturbations are essential for capturing environmental variability and individual uncertainty, yet their impact on long-term dynamics and equilibrium structure remains incompletely understood, particularly in the presence of nonlocal interactions. We investigate a stochastic interacting particle system governed by potential-driven interactions and its continuum density formulation in the large-population limit. We introduce an energy functional and show that the macroscopic density evolution has a gradient-flow structure in the Wasserstein-2 space. The associated variational framework yields equilibrium states through constrained energy minimization and illustrates how noise regulates the density and mitigates singular concentration. We demonstrate the connection between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions through numerical examples in one and two dimensions. Within the variational framework, we compute energy minimizers and perform a linear stability analysis. The numerical results show that the stable minimizers agree with the long-time dynamics of the macroscopic density model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03654v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Speedups for Derivative Pricing Beyond Black-Scholes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03725</link><description>arXiv:2602.03725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores advancements in quantum algorithms for derivative pricing of exotics, a computational pipeline of fundamental importance in quantitative finance. For such cases, the classical Monte Carlo integration procedure provides the state-of-the-art provable, asymptotic performance: polynomial in problem dimension and quadratic in inverse-precision. While quantum algorithms are known to offer quadratic speedups over classical Monte Carlo methods, end-to-end speedups have been proven only in the simplified setting over the Black-Scholes geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model. This paper extends existing frameworks to demonstrate novel quadratic speedups for more practical models, such as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and a variant of Heston's stochastic volatility model, utilizing a characteristic of the underlying SDEs which we term fast-forwardability. Additionally, for general models that do not possess the fast-forwardable property, we introduce a quantum Milstein sampler, based on a novel quantum algorithm for sampling L\'evy areas, which enables quantum multi-level Monte Carlo to achieve quadratic speedups for multi-dimensional stochastic processes exhibiting certain correlation types.
  We also present an improved analysis of numerical integration for derivative pricing, leading to substantial reductions in the resource requirements for pricing GBM and CIR models. Furthermore, we investigate the potential for additional reductions using arithmetic-free quantum procedures. Finally, we critique quantum partial differential equation (PDE) solvers as a method for derivative pricing based on amplitude estimation, identifying theoretical barriers that obstruct achieving a quantum speedup through this approach. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of quantum algorithms in derivative pricing, addressing key challenges and open questions in the field.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03725v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Variance-reduced Estimation from Generative EHR Models: The SCOPE and REACH Estimators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03730</link><description>arXiv:2602.03730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models trained using self-supervision of tokenized electronic health record (EHR) timelines show promise for clinical outcome prediction. This is typically done using Monte Carlo simulation for future patient trajectories. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: sparse estimate distributions that poorly differentiate patient risk levels, extreme computational costs, and high sampling variance. We propose two new estimators: the Sum of Conditional Outcome Probability Estimator (SCOPE) and Risk Estimation from Anticipated Conditional Hazards (REACH), that leverage next-token probability distributions discarded by standard Monte Carlo. We prove both estimators are unbiased and that REACH guarantees variance reduction over Monte Carlo sampling for any model and outcome. Empirically, on hospital mortality prediction in MIMIC-IV using the ETHOS-ARES framework, SCOPE and REACH match 100-sample Monte Carlo performance using only 10-11 samples (95% CI: [9,11]), representing a ~10x reduction in inference cost without degrading calibration. For ICU admission prediction, efficiency gains are more modest (~1.2x), which we attribute to the outcome's lower "spontaneity," a property we characterize theoretically and empirically. These methods substantially improve the feasibility of deploying generative EHR models in resource-constrained clinical settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03730v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reducing acquisition time and radiation damage: data-driven subsampling for spectro-microscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03744</link><description>arXiv:2602.03744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectro-microscopy is an experimental technique which can be used to observe spatial variations in chemical state and changes in chemical state over time or under experimental conditions. As a result it has broad applications across areas such as energy materials, catalysis, environmental science and biological samples. However, the technique is often limited by factors such as long acquisition times and radiation damage. We present two measurement strategies that allow for significantly shorter experiment times and total doses applied. The strategies are based on taking only a small subset of all the measurements (e.g. sparse acquisition or subsampling), and then computationally reconstructing all unobserved measurements using mathematical techniques. The methods are data-driven, using spectral and spatial importance subsampling distributions to identify important measurements. As a result, taking as little as 4-6\% of the measurements is sufficient to capture the same information as in a conventional scan.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03744v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Factor-balancedness, linear recurrence, and factor complexity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03746</link><description>arXiv:2602.03746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of infinite words, various notions of balancedness provide quantitative measures for how regularly letters or factors occur, and they find applications in several areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. In this paper, we study factor-balancedness and uniform factor-balancedness, making two main contributions. First, we establish general sufficient conditions for an infinite word to be (uniformly) factor-balanced, applicable in particular to any given linearly recurrent word. These conditions are formulated in terms of $\mathcal{S}$-adic representations and generalize results of Adamczewski on primitive substitutive words, which show that balancedness of length-2 factors already implies uniform factor-balancedness. As an application of our criteria, we characterize the Sturmian words and ternary Arnoux--Rauzy words that are uniformly factor-balanced as precisely those with bounded weak partial quotients. Our second main contribution is a study of the relationship between factor-balancedness and factor complexity. In particular, we analyze the non-primitive substitutive case and construct an example of a factor-balanced word with exponential factor complexity, thereby making progress on a question raised in 2025 by Arnoux, Berth\'e, Minervino, Steiner, and Thuswaldner on the relation between balancedness and discrete spectrum.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03746v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conditional Flow Matching for Visually-Guided Acoustic Highlighting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03762</link><description>arXiv:2602.03762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visually-guided acoustic highlighting seeks to rebalance audio in alignment with the accompanying video, creating a coherent audio-visual experience. While visual saliency and enhancement have been widely studied, acoustic highlighting remains underexplored, often leading to misalignment between visual and auditory focus. Existing approaches use discriminative models, which struggle with the inherent ambiguity in audio remixing, where no natural one-to-one mapping exists between poorly-balanced and well-balanced audio mixes. To address this limitation, we reframe this task as a generative problem and introduce a Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) framework. A key challenge in iterative flow-based generation is that early prediction errors -- in selecting the correct source to enhance -- compound over steps and push trajectories off-manifold. To address this, we introduce a rollout loss that penalizes drift at the final step, encouraging self-correcting trajectories and stabilizing long-range flow integration. We further propose a conditioning module that fuses audio and visual cues before vector field regression, enabling explicit cross-modal source selection. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method consistently surpasses the previous state-of-the-art discriminative approach, establishing that visually-guided audio remixing is best addressed through generative modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03762v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiffLOB: Diffusion Models for Counterfactual Generation in Limit Order Books</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03776</link><description>arXiv:2602.03776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern generative models for limit order books (LOBs) can reproduce realistic market dynamics, but remain fundamentally passive: they either model what typically happens without accounting for hypothetical future market conditions, or they require interaction with another agent to explore alternative outcomes. This limits their usefulness for stress testing, scenario analysis, and decision-making. We propose \textbf{DiffLOB}, a regime-conditioned \textbf{Diff}usion model for controllable and counterfactual generation of \textbf{LOB} trajectories. DiffLOB explicitly conditions the generative process on future market regimes--including trend, volatility, liquidity, and order-flow imbalance, which enables the model to answer counterfactual queries of the form: ``If the future market regime were X instead of Y, how would the limit order book evolve?'' Our systematic evaluation framework for counterfactual LOB generation consists of three criteria: (1) \textit{Controllable Realism}, measuring how well generated trajectories can reproduce marginal distributions, temporal dependence structure and regime variables; (2) \textit{Counterfactual validity}, testing whether interventions on future regimes induce consistent changes in the generated LOB dynamics; (3) \textit{Counterfactual usefulness}, assessing whether synthetic counterfactual trajectories improve downstream prediction of future market regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03776v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03789</link><description>arXiv:2602.03789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic interpolants unify flows and diffusions, popular generative modeling frameworks. A primary hyperparameter in these methods is the interpolation schedule that determines how to bridge a standard Gaussian base measure to an arbitrary target measure. We prove how to convert a sample path of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with arbitrary diffusion coefficient under any schedule into the unique sample path under another arbitrary schedule and diffusion coefficient. We then extend the stochastic interpolant framework to admit a larger class of point mass schedules in which the Gaussian base measure collapses to a point mass measure. Under the assumption of Gaussian data, we identify lazy schedule families that make the drift identically zero and show that with deterministic sampling one gets a variance-preserving schedule commonly used in diffusion models, whereas with statistically optimal SDE sampling one gets our point mass schedule. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness of our theoretical results on realistic highly non-Gaussian data, we apply our lazy schedule conversion to a state-of-the-art pretrained flow model and show that this allows for generating images in fewer steps without retraining the model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03789v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Preference-based Conditional Treatment Effects and Policy Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03823</link><description>arXiv:2602.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new preference-based framework for conditional treatment effect estimation and policy learning, built on the Conditional Preference-based Treatment Effect (CPTE). CPTE requires only that outcomes be ranked under a preference rule, unlocking flexible modeling of heterogeneous effects with multivariate, ordinal, or preference-driven outcomes. This unifies applications such as conditional probability of necessity and sufficiency, conditional Win Ratio, and Generalized Pairwise Comparisons. Despite the intrinsic non-identifiability of comparison-based estimands, CPTE provides interpretable targets and delivers new identifiability conditions for previous unidentifiable estimands. We present estimation strategies via matching, quantile, and distributional regression, and further design efficient influence-function estimators to correct plug-in bias and maximize policy value. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments demonstrate clear performance gains and practical impact.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03823v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep-learning-based pan-phenomic data reveals the explosive evolution of avian visual disparity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03824</link><description>arXiv:2602.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of biological morphology is critical for understanding the diversity of the natural world, yet traditional analyses often involve subjective biases in the selection and coding of morphological traits. This study employs deep learning techniques, utilising a ResNet34 model capable of recognising over 10,000 bird species, to explore avian morphological evolution. We extract weights from the model's final fully connected (fc) layer and investigate the semantic alignment between the high-dimensional embedding space learned by the model and biological phenotypes. The results demonstrate that the high-dimensional embedding space encodes phenotypic convergence. Subsequently, we assess the morphological disparity among various taxa and evaluate the association between morphological disparity and species richness, demonstrating that species richness is the primary driver of morphospace expansion. Moreover, the disparity-through-time analysis reveals a visual "early burst" after the K-Pg extinction.
  While mainly aimed at evolutionary analysis, this study also provides insights into the interpretability of Deep Neural Networks. We demonstrate that hierarchical semantic structures (biological taxonomy) emerged in the high-dimensional embedding space despite being trained on flat labels. Furthermore, through adversarial examples, we provide evidence that our model in this task can overcome texture bias and learn holistic shape representations (body plans), challenging the prevailing view that CNNs rely primarily on local textures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03824v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inapproximability of the independent set polynomial in the complex plane</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00282</link><description>arXiv:1711.00282v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of approximating the independent set polynomial $Z_G(\lambda)$ of a graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ when the activity $\lambda$ is a complex number. This problem is already well understood when $\lambda$ is real using connections to the $\Delta$-regular tree $T$. The key concept in that case is the "occupation ratio" of the tree $T$. This ratio is the contribution to $Z_T(\lambda)$ from independent sets containing the root of the tree, divided by $Z_T(\lambda)$ itself. If $\lambda$ is such that the occupation ratio converges to a limit, as the height of $T$ grows, then there is an FPTAS for approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ on a graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$. Otherwise, the approximation problem is NP-hard.
  Unsurprisingly, the case where $\lambda$ is complex is more challenging. Peters and Regts identified the complex values of $\lambda$ for which the occupation ratio of the $\Delta$-regular tree converges. These values carve a cardioid-shaped region $\Lambda_\Delta$ in the complex plane. Motivated by the picture in the real case, they asked whether $\Lambda_\Delta$ marks the true approximability threshold for general complex values $\lambda$.
  Our main result shows that for every $\lambda$ outside of $\Lambda_\Delta$, the problem of approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ on graphs $G$ with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ is indeed NP-hard. In fact, when $\lambda$ is outside of $\Lambda_\Delta$ and is not a positive real number, we give the stronger result that approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ is actually #P-hard. If $\lambda$ is a negative real number outside of $\Lambda_\Delta$, we show that it is #P-hard to even decide whether $Z_G(\lambda)&gt;0$, resolving in the affirmative a conjecture of Harvey, Srivastava and Vondrak. Our proof techniques are based around tools from complex analysis -- specifically the study of iterative multivariate rational maps.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:1711.00282v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Convergence of Experience Replay in Policy Optimization: Characterizing Bias, Variance, and Finite-Time Convergence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08902</link><description>arXiv:2110.08902v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experience replay is a core ingredient of modern deep reinforcement learning, yet its benefits in policy optimization are poorly understood beyond empirical heuristics. This paper develops a novel theoretical framework for experience replay in modern policy gradient methods, where two sources of dependence fundamentally complicate analysis: Markovian correlations along trajectories and policy drift across optimization iterations. We introduce a new proof technique based on auxiliary Markov chains and lag-based decoupling that makes these dependencies tractable. Within this framework, we derive finite-time bias bounds for policy-gradient estimators under replay, identifying how bias scales with the cumulative policy update, the mixing time of the underlying dynamics, and the age of buffered data, thereby formalizing the practitioner's rule of avoiding overly stale replay. We further provide a correlation-aware variance decomposition showing how sample dependence governs gradient variance from replay and when replay is beneficial. Building on these characterizations, we establish the finite-time convergence guarantees for experience-replay-based policy optimization, explicitly quantifying how buffer size, sample correlation, and mixing jointly determine the convergence rate and revealing an inherent bias-variance trade-off: larger buffers can reduce variance by averaging less correlated samples but can increase bias as data become stale. These results offer a principled guide for buffer sizing and replay schedules, bridging prior empirical findings with quantitative theory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2110.08902v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Discrete Latent Structure in Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07473</link><description>arXiv:2301.07473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many types of data from fields including natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics, are well represented by discrete, compositional structures such as trees, sequences, or matchings. Latent structure models are a powerful tool for learning to extract such representations, offering a way to incorporate structural bias, discover insight about the data, and interpret decisions. However, effective training is challenging, as neural networks are typically designed for continuous computation.
  This text explores three broad strategies for learning with discrete latent structure: continuous relaxation, surrogate gradients, and probabilistic estimation. Our presentation relies on consistent notations for a wide range of models. As such, we reveal many new connections between latent structure learning strategies, showing how most consist of the same small set of fundamental building blocks, but use them differently, leading to substantially different applicability and properties.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2301.07473v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Contextual Causal Bayesian Optimisation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12412</link><description>arXiv:2301.12412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for contextual and causal Bayesian optimisation, which aims to design intervention policies maximising the expectation of a target variable. Our approach leverages both observed contextual information and known causal graph structures to guide the search. Within this framework, we propose a novel algorithm that jointly optimises over policies and the sets of variables on which these policies are defined. This thereby extends and unifies two previously distinct approaches: Causal Bayesian Optimisation and Contextual Bayesian Optimisation, while also addressing their limitations in scenarios that yield suboptimal results. We derive worst-case and instance-dependent high-probability regret bounds for our algorithm. We report experimental results across diverse environments, corroborating that our approach achieves sublinear regret and reduces sample complexity in high-dimensional settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2301.12412v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AlignAtt: Using Attention-based Audio-Translation Alignments as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11408</link><description>arXiv:2305.11408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attention is the core mechanism of today's most used architectures for natural language processing and has been analyzed from many perspectives, including its effectiveness for machine translation-related tasks. Among these studies, attention resulted to be a useful source of information to get insights about word alignment also when the input text is substituted with audio segments, as in the case of the speech translation (ST) task. In this paper, we propose AlignAtt, a novel policy for simultaneous ST (SimulST) that exploits the attention information to generate source-target alignments that guide the model during inference. Through experiments on the 8 language pairs of MuST-C v1.0, we show that AlignAtt outperforms previous state-of-the-art SimulST policies applied to offline-trained models with gains in terms of BLEU of 2 points and latency reductions ranging from 0.5s to 0.8s across the 8 languages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2305.11408v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Graph Dynamics and Kan Extensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13393</link><description>arXiv:2403.13393v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the one side, the formalism of Global Transformations comes with the claim of capturing any transformation of space that is local, synchronous and deterministic. The claim has been proven for different classes of models such as mesh refinements from computer graphics, Lindenmayer systems from morphogenesis modeling and cellular automata from biological, physical and parallel computation modeling. The Global Transformation formalism achieves this by using category theory for its genericity, and more precisely the notion of Kan extension to determine the global behaviors based on the local ones. On the other side, Causal Graph Dynamics describe the transformation of port graphs in a synchronous and deterministic way and has not yet being tackled. In this paper, we show the precise sense in which the claim of Global Transformations holds for them as well. This is done by showing different ways in which they can be expressed as Kan extensions, each of them highlighting different features of Causal Graph Dynamics. Along the way, this work uncovers the interesting class of Monotonic Causal Graph Dynamics and their universality among General Causal Graph Dynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2403.13393v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mapping the Unseen: Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping with Dynamic Labeling using Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02162</link><description>arXiv:2405.02162v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Panoptic maps enable robots to reason about both geometry and semantics. However, open-vocabulary models repeatedly produce closely related labels that split panoptic entities and degrade volumetric consistency. The proposed UPPM advances open-world scene understanding by leveraging foundation models to introduce a panoptic Dynamic Descriptor that reconciles open-vocabulary labels with unified category structure and geometric size priors. The fusion for such dynamic descriptors is performed within a multi-resolution multi-TSDF map using language-guided open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation and semantic retrieval, resulting in a persistent and promptable panoptic map without additional model training. Based on our evaluation experiments, UPPM shows the best overall performance in terms of the map reconstruction accuracy and the panoptic segmentation quality. The ablation study investigates the contribution for each component of UPPM (custom NMS, blurry-frame filtering, and unified semantics) to the overall system performance. Consequently, UPPM preserves open-vocabulary interpretability while delivering strong geometric and panoptic accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.02162v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HAAP: Vision-context Hierarchical Attention Autoregressive with Adaptive Permutation for Scene Text Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09125</link><description>arXiv:2405.09125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) is challenging in extracting effective character representations from visual data when text is unreadable. Permutation language modeling (PLM) is introduced to refine character predictions by jointly capturing contextual and visual information. However, in PLM, the use of random permutations causes training fit oscillation, and the iterative refinement (IR) operation also introduces additional overhead. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Hierarchical Attention autoregressive Model with Adaptive Permutation (HAAP) to enhance position-context-image interaction capability, improving autoregressive LM generalization. First, we propose Implicit Permutation Neurons (IPN) to generate adaptive attention masks that dynamically exploit token dependencies, enhancing the correlation between visual information and context. Adaptive correlation representation helps the model avoid training fit oscillation. Second, the Cross-modal Hierarchical Attention mechanism (CHA) is introduced to capture the dependencies among position queries, contextual semantics and visual information. CHA enables position tokens to aggregate global semantic information, avoiding the need for IR. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed HAAP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of accuracy, complexity, and latency on several datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.09125v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparse maximal update parameterization: A holistic approach to sparse training dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15743</link><description>arXiv:2405.15743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several challenges make it difficult for sparse neural networks to compete with dense models. First, setting a large fraction of weights to zero impairs forward and gradient signal propagation. Second, sparse studies often need to test multiple sparsity levels, while also introducing new hyperparameters (HPs), leading to prohibitive tuning costs. Indeed, the standard practice is to re-use the learning HPs originally crafted for dense models. Unfortunately, we show sparse and dense networks do not share the same optimal HPs. Without stable dynamics and effective training recipes, it is costly to test sparsity at scale, which is key to surpassing dense networks and making the business case for sparsity acceleration in hardware.
  A holistic approach is needed to tackle these challenges and we propose S$\mu$Par as one such approach. For random unstructured static sparsity, S$\mu$Par ensures activations, gradients, and weight updates all scale independently of sparsity level. Further, by reparameterizing the HPs, S$\mu$Par enables the same HP values to be optimal as we vary both sparsity level and model width. HPs can be tuned on small dense networks and transferred to large sparse models, greatly reducing tuning costs. On large-scale language modeling, S$\mu$Par shows increasing improvements over standard parameterization as sparsity increases, leading up to 11.9% relative loss improvement at 99.2% sparsity. A minimal implementation of S$\mu$Par is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/nanoGPT-mup/tree/supar.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.15743v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Merged ChemProt-DrugProt for Relation Extraction from Biomedical Literature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18605</link><description>arXiv:2405.18605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extraction of chemical-gene relations plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate interactions between chemical compounds and genes, with significant implications for drug discovery, disease understanding, and biomedical research. This paper presents a data set created by merging the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets to augment sample counts and improve model accuracy. We evaluate the merged dataset using two state of the art relationship extraction algorithms: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) specifically BioBERT, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) combined with BioBERT. While BioBERT excels at capturing local contexts, it may benefit from incorporating global information essential for understanding chemical-gene interactions. This can be achieved by integrating GCNs with BioBERT to harness both global and local context. Our results show that by integrating the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets, we demonstrated significant improvements in model performance, particularly in CPR groups shared between the datasets. Incorporating the global context using GCN can help increase the overall precision and recall in some of the CPR groups over using just BioBERT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.18605v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ME-IGM: Individual-Global-Max in Maximum Entropy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13930</link><description>arXiv:2406.13930v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent credit assignment is a fundamental challenge for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where a team of agents learn from shared reward signals. The Individual-Global-Max (IGM) condition is a widely used principle for multi-agent credit assignment, requiring that the joint action determined by individual Q-functions maximizes the global Q-value. Meanwhile, the principle of maximum entropy has been leveraged to enhance exploration in MARL. However, we identify a critical limitation in existing maximum entropy MARL methods: a misalignment arises between local policies and the joint policy that maximizes the global Q-value, leading to violations of the IGM condition. To address this misalignment, we propose an order-preserving transformation. Building on it, we introduce ME-IGM, a novel maximum entropy MARL algorithm compatible with any credit assignment mechanism that satisfies the IGM condition while enjoying the benefits of maximum entropy exploration. We empirically evaluate two variants of ME-IGM: ME-QMIX and ME-QPLEX, in non-monotonic matrix games, and demonstrate their state-of-the-art performance across 17 scenarios in SMAC-v2 and Overcooked.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.13930v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Syntax-Injected Approach for Faster and More Accurate Sentiment Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15163</link><description>arXiv:2406.15163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) is a crucial aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on identifying and interpreting subjective assessments in textual content. Syntactic parsing is useful in SA as it improves accuracy and provides explainability; however, it often becomes a computational bottleneck due to slow parsing algorithms. This article proposes a solution to this bottleneck by using a Sequence Labeling Syntactic Parser (SELSP) to integrate syntactic information into SA via a rule-based sentiment analysis pipeline. By reformulating dependency parsing as a sequence labeling task, we significantly improve the efficiency of syntax-based SA. SELSP is trained and evaluated on a ternary polarity classification task, demonstrating greater speed and accuracy compared to conventional parsers like Stanza and heuristic approaches such as Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER). The combination of speed and accuracy makes SELSP especially attractive for sentiment analysis applications in both academic and industrial contexts. Moreover, we compare SELSP with Transformer-based models trained on a 5-label classification task. In addition, we evaluate multiple sentiment dictionaries with SELSP to determine which yields the best performance in polarity prediction. The results show that dictionaries accounting for polarity judgment variation outperform those that ignore it. Furthermore, we show that SELSP outperforms Transformer-based models in terms of speed for polarity prediction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.15163v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conformal Prediction for Causal Effects of Continuous Treatments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03094</link><description>arXiv:2407.03094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of causal effects is crucial for safety-critical applications such as personalized medicine. A powerful approach for this is conformal prediction, which has several practical benefits due to model-agnostic finite-sample guarantees. Yet, existing methods for conformal prediction of causal effects are limited to binary/discrete treatments and make highly restrictive assumptions such as known propensity scores. In this work, we provide a novel conformal prediction method for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. We account for the additional uncertainty introduced through propensity estimation so that our conformal prediction intervals are valid even if the propensity score is unknown. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We derive finite-sample prediction intervals for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. (2) We provide an algorithm for calculating the derived intervals. (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of the conformal prediction intervals in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose conformal prediction for continuous treatments when the propensity score is unknown and must be estimated from data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.03094v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hyper-Compression: Model Compression via Hyperfunction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00592</link><description>arXiv:2409.00592v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large models' size has far outpaced that of computing resources. To bridge this gap, encouraged by the parsimonious relationship between genotype and phenotype in the brain's growth and development, we propose the so-called Hyper-Compression that turns the model compression into the issue of parameter representation via a hyperfunction. Specifically, it is known that the trajectory of some low-dimensional dynamic systems can fill the high-dimensional space eventually. Thus, Hyper-Compression, using these dynamic systems as the hyperfunctions, represents the parameters of the target network by their corresponding composition number or trajectory length. This suggests a novel mechanism for model compression, substantially different from the existing pruning, quantization, distillation, and decomposition. Along this direction, we methodologically identify a suitable dynamic system with the irrational winding as the hyperfunction and theoretically derive its associated error bound. Next, guided by our theoretical insights, we propose several engineering twists to make the Hyper-Compression pragmatic and effective.

Abstract: We address the fundamental task of inferring cross-document coreference and hierarchy in scientific texts, which has important applications in knowledge graph construction, search, recommendation and discovery. Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle when faced with many long-tail technical concepts with nuanced variations. We present a novel method which generates context-dependent definitions of concept mentions by retrieving full-text literature, and uses the definitions to enhance detection of cross-document relations. We further generate relational definitions, which describe how two concept mentions are related or different, and design an efficient re-ranking approach to address the combinatorial explosion involved in inferring links across papers. In both fine-tuning and in-context learning settings, we achieve large gains in performance on data subsets with high amount of different surfaces forms and ambiguity, that are challenging for models. We provide analysis of generated definitions, shedding light on the relational reasoning ability of LLMs over fine-grained scientific concepts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.15113v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Saliency-Guided DETR for Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01615</link><description>arXiv:2410.01615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches for video moment retrieval and highlight detection are not able to align text and video features efficiently, resulting in unsatisfying performance and limited production usage. To address this, we propose a novel architecture that utilizes recent foundational video models designed for such alignment. Combined with the introduced Saliency-Guided Cross Attention mechanism and a hybrid DETR architecture, our approach significantly enhances performance in both moment retrieval and highlight detection tasks. For even better improvement, we developed InterVid-MR, a large-scale and high-quality dataset for pretraining. Using it, our architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the QVHighlights, Charades-STA and TACoS benchmarks. The proposed approach provides an efficient and scalable solution for both zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios in video-language tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.01615v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Compact LED-Based Displacement Sensing for Robot Fingers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03481</link><description>arXiv:2410.03481v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a sensor designed for integration in robot fingers, where it can provide information on the displacements induced by external contact. Our sensor uses LEDs to sense the displacement between two plates connected by a transparent elastomer; when a force is applied to the finger, the elastomer displaces and the LED signals change. We show that using LEDs as both light emitters an receivers in this context provides high sensitivity, allowing such an emitter and receiver pairs to detect very small displacements. We characterize the standalone performance of the sensor by testing the ability of a supervised learning model to predict complete force and torque data from its raw signals, and obtain a mean error between 0.05 and 0.07 N across the three directions of force applied to the finger. Our method allows for finger-size packaging with no amplification electronics, low cost manufacturing, easy integration into a complete hand, and high overload shear forces and bending torques, suggesting future applicability to complete manipulation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.03481v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast Training of Sinusoidal Neural Fields via Scaling Initialization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04779</link><description>arXiv:2410.04779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural fields are an emerging paradigm that represent data as continuous functions parameterized by neural networks. Despite many advantages, neural fields often have a high training cost, which prevents a broader adoption. In this paper, we focus on a popular family of neural fields, called sinusoidal neural fields (SNFs), and study how it should be initialized to maximize the training speed. We find that the standard initialization scheme for SNFs -- designed based on the signal propagation principle -- is suboptimal. In particular, we show that by simply multiplying each weight (except for the last layer) by a constant, we can accelerate SNF training by 10$\times$. This method, coined $\textit{weight scaling}$, consistently provides a significant speedup over various data domains, allowing the SNFs to train faster than more recently proposed architectures. To understand why the weight scaling works well, we conduct extensive theoretical and empirical analyses which reveal that the weight scaling not only resolves the spectral bias quite effectively but also enjoys a well-conditioned optimization trajectory.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have been successfully extended to the time series (TS) domain, facilitated by the emergence of large-scale TS datasets. However, previous efforts have primarily Capturing channel dependency (CD) is essential for modeling multivariate time series (TS), and attention-based methods have been widely employed for this purpose. Nonetheless, these methods primarily focus on modifying the architecture, often neglecting the importance of dataset-specific characteristics. In this work, we introduce the concept of partial channel dependence (PCD) to enhance CD modeling in Transformer-based models by leveraging dataset-specific information to refine the CD captured by the model. To achieve PCD, we propose channel masks (CMs), which are integrated into the attention matrices of Transformers via element-wise multiplication. CMs consist of two components: 1) a similarity matrix that captures relationships between the channels, and 2) dataset-specific and learnable domain parameters that refine the similarity matrix. We validate the effectiveness of PCD across diverse tasks and datasets with various backbones. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/YonseiML/pcd.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.23222v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantization Meets Projection: A Happy Marriage for Approximate k-Nearest Neighbor Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06158</link><description>arXiv:2411.06158v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate $k$-nearest neighbor (AKNN) search is a fundamental problem with wide applications. To reduce memory and accelerate search, vector quantization is widely adopted. However, existing quantization methods either rely on codebooks -- whose query speed is limited by costly table lookups -- or adopt dimension-wise quantization, which maps each vector dimension to a small quantized code for fast search. The latter, however, suffers from a fixed compression ratio because the quantized code length is inherently tied to the original dimensionality. To overcome these limitations, we propose MRQ, a new approach that integrates projection with quantization. The key insight is that, after projection, high-dimensional vectors tend to concentrate most of their information in the leading dimensions. MRQ exploits this property by quantizing only the information-dense projected subspace -- whose size is fully user-tunable -- thereby decoupling the quantized code length from the original dimensionality. The remaining tail dimensions are captured using lightweight statistical summaries. By doing so, MRQ boosts the query efficiency of existing quantization methods while achieving arbitrary compression ratios enabled by the projection step. Extensive experiments show that MRQ substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art method, achieving up to 3x faster search with only one-third the quantization bits for comparable accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.06158v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MemoryFormer: Minimize Transformer Computation by Removing Fully-Connected Layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12992</link><description>arXiv:2411.12992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to reduce the computational complexity of large language models, great efforts have been made to to improve the efficiency of transformer models such as linear attention and flash-attention. However, the model size and corresponding computational complexity are constantly scaled up in pursuit of higher performance. In this work, we present MemoryFormer, a novel transformer architecture which significantly reduces the computational complexity (FLOPs) from a new perspective. We eliminate nearly all the computations of the transformer model except for the necessary computation required by the multi-head attention operation. This is made possible by utilizing an alternative method for feature transformation to replace the linear projection of fully-connected layers. Specifically, we first construct a group of in-memory lookup tables that store a large amount of discrete vectors to replace the weight matrix used in linear projection. We then use a hash algorithm to retrieve a correlated subset of vectors dynamically based on the input embedding. The retrieved vectors combined together will form the output embedding, which provides an estimation of the result of matrix multiplication operation in a fully-connected layer. Compared to conducting matrix multiplication, retrieving data blocks from memory is a much cheaper operation which requires little computations. We train MemoryFormer from scratch and conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.12992v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agnostic Learning of Arbitrary ReLU Activation under Gaussian Marginals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14349</link><description>arXiv:2411.14349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning an arbitrarily-biased ReLU activation (or neuron) over Gaussian marginals with the squared loss objective. Despite the ReLU neuron being the basic building block of modern neural networks, we still do not understand the basic algorithmic question of whether one arbitrary ReLU neuron is learnable in the non-realizable setting. In particular, all existing polynomial time algorithms only provide approximation guarantees for the better-behaved unbiased setting or restricted bias setting.
  Our main result is a polynomial time statistical query (SQ) algorithm that gives the first constant factor approximation for arbitrary bias. It outputs a ReLU activation that achieves a loss of $O(\mathrm{OPT}) + \varepsilon$ in time $\mathrm{poly}(d,1/\varepsilon)$, where $\mathrm{OPT}$ is the loss obtained by the optimal ReLU activation. Our algorithm presents an interesting departure from existing algorithms, which are all based on gradient descent and thus fall within the class of correlational statistical query (CSQ) algorithms. We complement our algorithmic result by showing that no polynomial time CSQ algorithm can achieve a constant factor approximation. Together, these results shed light on the intrinsic limitation of gradient descent, while identifying arguably the simplest setting (a single neuron) where there is a separation between SQ and CSQ algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.14349v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fides: Secure and Scalable Asynchronous DAG Consensus via Trusted Components</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01062</link><description>arXiv:2501.01062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DAG-based BFT consensus has attracted growing interest in distributed data management systems for consistent replication in untrusted settings due to its high throughput and resilience to asynchrony. However, existing protocols still suffer from high communication overhead and long commit latency. In parallel, introducing minimal hardware trust has proven effective in reducing the complexity of BFT consensus.
  Inspired by these works, we present Fides, an asynchronous DAG-based BFT consensus protocol that, to our knowledge, is among the first to leverage TEEs to enhance both scalability and efficiency. Fides tolerates a minority of Byzantine replicas and achieves $O(\kappa n^2 + n^3)$ metadata communication complexity through a customized TEE-assisted Reliable Broadcast (T-RBC) primitive with linear communication complexity in one-step broadcast.Building on T-RBC, Fides redefines the DAG construction rules by reducing the reference requirement from $2f+1$ to $f+1$ between consecutive vertices. This new structure weakens DAG connectivity and invalidates traditional commit rules, so we formally abstract the problem and derive new theoretical bounds of liveness. We further propose a four-round commit rule that achieves the theoretically minimal commit latency. Besides, we design two additional primitives, T-RoundCert and T-Coin, to efficiently certify DAG references and replace the costly cryptographic common coin used in prior protocols.Comprehensive evaluations on geo-distributed and local testbeds show that Fides substantially outperforms state-of-the-art protocols, including Tusk, Bullshark, Mysticeti, RCC, Damysus, Achilles and HybridSet, achieving lower latency and higher throughput while preserving strong safety and liveness guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.01062v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Pathfinding Under Team-Connected Communication Constraint via Adaptive Path Expansion and Dynamic Leading</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02770</link><description>arXiv:2501.02770v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel planning framework to handle a multi-agent pathfinding problem under team-connected communication constraint, where all agents must have a connected communication channel to the rest of the team during their entire movements. Standard multi-agent path finding approaches (e.g., priority-based search) have potential in this domain but fail when neighboring configurations at start and goal differ. Their single-expansion approach -- computing each agent's path from the start to the goal in just a single expansion -- cannot reliably handle planning under communication constraints for agents as their neighbors change during navigating. Similarly, leader-follower approaches (e.g., platooning) are effective at maintaining team communication, but fixing the leader at the outset of planning can cause planning to become stuck in dense-clutter environments, limiting their practical utility. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel two-level multi-agent pathfinding framework that integrates two techniques: adaptive path expansion to expand agent paths to their goals in multiple stages; and dynamic leading technique that enables the reselection of the leading agent during each agent path expansion whenever progress cannot be made. Simulation experiments show the efficiency of our planners, which can handle up to 25 agents across five environment types under a limited communication range constraint and up to 11-12 agents on three environment types under line-of-sight communication constraint, exceeding 90% success-rate where baselines routinely fail.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.02770v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] If It's Nice, Do It Twice: We Should Try Iterative Corpus Curation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15280</link><description>arXiv:2501.15280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work demonstrates that filtering harmful content from pretraining data improves model safety without degrading capabilities. We propose a natural extension: do it again. A model trained on filtered data can filter the corpus further; training on this cleaner corpus produces an even cleaner model. We provide theoretical analysis showing this process converges to a self-consistent corpus where the model trained on it approves of its own training data. Even under the weak assumption of constant filter quality, iteration yields decay in harmful content. We argue this framework offers a novel form of scalable oversight. While model internals are opaque, the resulting corpus is human-auditable. Even a single iteration produces a large-scale preference annotations over documents, potentially valuable for interpretability research. We derive bounds on capability-safety tradeoffs and outline open questions. We call on researchers with pretraining infrastructure to empirically test this approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.15280v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Bottlenecks in Safety Fine-Tuning of Vision Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18533</link><description>arXiv:2501.18533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their deployment in safety-critical domains poses significant challenges. Existing safety fine-tuning methods, which focus on textual or multimodal content, fall short in addressing challenging cases or disrupt the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness. Our evaluation highlights a safety reasoning gap: these methods lack safety visual reasoning ability, leading to such bottlenecks. To address this limitation and enhance both visual perception and reasoning in safety-critical contexts, we propose a novel dataset that integrates multi-image inputs with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels as fine-grained reasoning logic to improve model performance. Specifically, we introduce the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, an instruction-following dataset tailored for multi-image safety scenarios, consisting of training and test splits. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B with MIS significantly outperforms both powerful open-source models and API-based models in challenging multi-image tasks requiring safety-related visual reasoning. This approach not only delivers exceptional safety performance but also preserves general capabilities without any trade-offs. Specifically, fine-tuning with MIS increases average accuracy by 0.83% across five general benchmarks and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) on multiple safety benchmarks by a large margin.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.18533v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Graph Learning will stall without Network Science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01177</link><description>arXiv:2502.01177v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Most flagship language models generate explicit reasoning chains, enabling inference-time scaling. However, producing these reasoning chains increases token usage (i.e., reasoning tokens), which in turn increases latency and costs. Our OverThink attack increases overhead for applications that rely on reasoning language models (RLMs) and external context by forcing them to spend substantially more reasoning tokens while still producing contextually correct answers. An adversary mounts an attack by injecting decoy reasoning problems into public content that is consumed by RLM at inference time. Because our decoys (e.g., Markov decision processes, Sudokus, etc.) are benign, they evade safety filters. We evaluate OverThink on both closed-source and open-source reasoning models across the FreshQA, SQuAD, and MuSR datasets. We also explore the attack in multi-modal settings by creating images that cause excessive reasoning. We show that the resulting slowdown transfers across models. Finally, we explore both LLM-based and systems-level defenses, and discuss the societal, financial, and energy implications of the OverThink attacks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.02542v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Representation Dynamics of Diffusion Models via Low-Dimensional Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05743</link><description>arXiv:2502.05743v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models, though originally designed for generative tasks, have demonstrated impressive self-supervised representation learning capabilities. A particularly intriguing phenomenon in these models is the emergence of unimodal representation dynamics, where the quality of learned features peaks at an intermediate noise level. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical investigation of this phenomenon. Leveraging the inherent low-dimensionality structure of image data, we theoretically demonstrate that the unimodal dynamic emerges when the diffusion model successfully captures the underlying data distribution. The unimodality arises from an interplay between denoising strength and class confidence across noise scales. Empirically, we further show that, in classification tasks, the presence of unimodal dynamics reliably reflects the generalization of the diffusion model: it emerges when the model generates novel images and gradually transitions to a monotonically decreasing curve as the model begins to memorize the training data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.05743v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-turn Evaluation of Anthropomorphic Behaviours in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07077</link><description>arXiv:2502.07077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tendency of users to anthropomorphise large language models (LLMs) is of growing interest to AI developers, researchers, and policy-makers. Here, we present a novel method for empirically evaluating anthropomorphic LLM behaviours in realistic and varied settings. Going beyond single-turn static benchmarks, we contribute three methodological advances in state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM evaluation. First, we develop a multi-turn evaluation of 14 anthropomorphic behaviours. Second, we present a scalable, automated approach by employing simulations of user interactions. Third, we conduct an interactive, large-scale human subject study (N=1101) to validate that the model behaviours we measure predict real users' anthropomorphic perceptions. We find that all SOTA LLMs evaluated exhibit similar behaviours, characterised by relationship-building (e.g., empathy and validation) and first-person pronoun use, and that the majority of behaviours only first occur after multiple turns. Our work lays an empirical foundation for investigating how design choices influence anthropomorphic model behaviours and for progressing the ethical debate on the desirability of these behaviours. It also showcases the necessity of multi-turn evaluations for complex social phenomena in human-AI interaction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.07077v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Neural Operator Emulator for Coastal and Riverine Shallow Water Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14782</link><description>arXiv:2502.14782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coastal regions and river floodplains are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Accurate real-time forecasting of hydrodynamic processes in these areas is essential for infrastructure planning and climate adaptation. Yet high-fidelity numerical models are often too computationally expensive for real-time use, and lower-cost approaches, such as traditional model order reduction algorithms or conventional neural networks, typically struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution conditions. In this study, we present the Multiple-Input Temporal Operator Network (MITONet), a novel autoregressive neural emulator that employs latent-space operator learning to efficiently approximate high-dimensional numerical solvers for complex, nonlinear problems that are governed by time-dependent, parameterized partial differential equations. We showcase MITONet's predictive capabilities by forecasting regional tide-driven dynamics in the Shinnecock Inlet in New York and riverine flow in a section of the Red River in Louisiana, both described by the two-dimensional shallow-water equations (2D SWE), while incorporating initial conditions, time-varying boundary conditions, and domain parameters such as the bottom friction coefficient. Despite the distinct flow regimes, the complex geometries and meshes, and the wide range of bottom friction coefficients studied, MITONet displays consistently high predictive skill, with anomaly correlation coefficients above 0.9, a maximum normalized root mean square error of 0.011, and computational speedups between 100x-1,250x, even for 175 days of autoregressive rollout forecast from random initial conditions and with unseen parameter values.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.14782v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MetaSym: A Symplectic Meta-learning Framework for Physical Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16667</link><description>arXiv:2502.16667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable and generalizable physics-aware deep learning has long been considered a significant challenge with various applications across diverse domains ranging from robotics to molecular dynamics. Central to almost all physical systems are symplectic forms, the geometric backbone that underpins fundamental invariants like energy and momentum. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, MetaSym. In particular, MetaSym combines a strong symplectic inductive bias obtained from a symplectic encoder, and an autoregressive decoder with meta-attention. This principled design ensures that core physical invariants remain intact, while allowing flexible, data efficient adaptation to system heterogeneities. We benchmark MetaSym with highly varied and realistic datasets, such as a high-dimensional spring-mesh system Otness et al. (2021), an open quantum system with dissipation and measurement backaction, and robotics-inspired quadrotor dynamics. Crucially, we fine-tune and deploy MetaSym on real-world quadrotor data, demonstrating robustness to sensor noise and real-world uncertainty. Across all tasks, MetaSym achieves superior few-shot adaptation and outperforms larger state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.16667v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Problem Solved?

Abstract: This paper defines and explores the design space for information extraction (IE) from layout-rich documents using large language models (LLMs). The three core challenges of layout-aware IE with LLMs are 1) data structuring, 2) model engagement, and 3) output refinement. Our study investigates the sub-problems and methods within these core challenges, such as input representation, chunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. It examines the effect of different design choices through LayIE-LLM, a new, open-source, layout-aware IE test suite, benchmarking against traditional, fine-tuned IE models. The results on two IE datasets show that LLMs require adjustment of the IE pipeline to achieve competitive performance: the optimized configuration found with LayIE-LLM achieves 13.3--37.5 F1 points more than a general-practice baseline configuration using the same LLM. To find a well-working configuration, we develop a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method that achieves near-optimal results. Our method is only 0.8--1.8 points lower than the best full factorial exploration with a fraction (2.8%) of the required computation. Overall, we demonstrate that, if well-configured, general-purpose LLMs match the performance of specialized models, providing a cost-effective, finetuning-free alternative.

Abstract: This work introduces a unified framework for analyzing games in greater depth. In the existing literature, players' strategies are typically assigned scalar values, and equilibrium concepts are used to identify compatible choices. However, this approach neglects the internal structure of players, thereby failing to accurately model observed behaviors.
  To address this limitation, we propose an abstract definition of a player, consistent with constructions in reinforcement learning. Instead of defining games as external settings, our framework defines them in terms of the players themselves. This offers a language that enables a deeper connection between games and learning. To illustrate the need for this generality, we study a simple two-player game and show that even in basic settings, a sophisticated player may adopt dynamic strategies that cannot be captured by simpler models or compatibility analysis.
  For a general definition of a player, we discuss natural conditions on its components and define competition through their behavior. In the discrete setting, we consider players whose estimates largely follow the standard framework from the literature. We explore connections to correlated equilibrium and highlight that dynamic programming naturally applies to all estimates. In the mean-field setting, we exploit symmetry to construct explicit examples of equilibria. Finally, we conclude by examining relations to reinforcement learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.00227v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Latent Space Representation of Electricity Market Curves: Maintaining Structural Integrity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11294</link><description>arXiv:2503.11294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently representing supply and demand curves is vital for energy market analysis and downstream modelling; however, dimensionality reduction often produces reconstructions that violate fundamental economic principles such as monotonicity. This paper evaluates the performance of PCA, Kernel PCA, UMAP, and AutoEncoder across 2d and 3d latent spaces. During preprocessing, we transform the original data to achieve a unified structure, mitigate outlier effects, and focus on critical curve segments. To ensure theoretical validity, we integrate Isotonic Regression as an optional post-processing step to enforce monotonic constraints on reconstructed outputs. Results from a three-year hourly MIBEL dataset demonstrate that the non-linear technique UMAP consistently outperforms other methods, securing the top rank across multiple error metrics. Furthermore, Isotonic Regression serves as a crucial corrective layer, significantly reducing error and restoring physical validity for several methods. We argue that UMAP`s local structure preservation, combined with intelligent post-processing, provides a robust foundation for downstream tasks such as forecasting, classification, and clustering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.11294v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LP-MPPI: Low-Pass Filtering for Efficient Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11717</link><description>arXiv:2503.11717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a widely used sampling-based approach for real-time control, valued for its flexibility in handling arbitrary dynamics and cost functions. However, it often suffers from high-frequency noise in the sampled control trajectories, which hinders the search for optimal controls and transfers to the applied controls, leading to actuator wear. In this work, we introduce Low-Pass Model Predictive Path Integral Control (LP-MPPI), which integrates low-pass filtering into the sampling process to eliminate detrimental high-frequency components and enhance the algorithm's efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, LP-MPPI provides direct and interpretable control over the frequency spectrum of sampled control trajectory perturbations, leading to more efficient sampling and smoother control. Through extensive evaluations in Gymnasium environments, simulated quadruped locomotion, and real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, we demonstrate that LP-MPPI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MPPI variants, achieving significant performance improvements while reducing control signal chattering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.11717v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OptiPMB: Enhancing 3D Multi-Object Tracking with Optimized Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Filtering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12968</link><description>arXiv:2503.12968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial for autonomous driving, as it enables robust perception, navigation, and planning in complex environments. While deep learning-based solutions have demonstrated impressive 3D MOT performance, model-based approaches remain appealing for their simplicity, interpretability, and data efficiency. Conventional model-based trackers typically rely on random vector-based Bayesian filters within the tracking-by-detection (TBD) framework but face limitations due to heuristic data association and track management schemes. In contrast, random finite set (RFS)-based Bayesian filtering handles object birth, survival, and death in a theoretically sound manner, facilitating interpretability and parameter tuning. In this paper, we present OptiPMB, a novel RFS-based 3D MOT method that employs an optimized Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter while incorporating several key innovative designs within the TBD framework. Specifically, we propose a measurement-driven hybrid adaptive birth model for improved track initialization, employ adaptive detection probability parameters to effectively maintain tracks for occluded objects, and optimize density pruning and track extraction modules to further enhance overall tracking performance. Extensive evaluations on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show that OptiPMB achieves superior tracking accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, thereby establishing a new benchmark for model-based 3D MOT and offering valuable insights for future research on RFS-based trackers in autonomous driving.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.12968v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FedVSR: Towards Model-Agnostic Federated Learning in Video Super-Resolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13745</link><description>arXiv:2503.13745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to enhance low-resolution videos by leveraging both spatial and temporal information. While deep learning has led to impressive progress, it typically requires centralized data, which raises privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-friendly solution, but general FL frameworks often struggle with low-level vision tasks, resulting in blurry, low-quality outputs. To address this, we introduce FedVSR, the first FL framework specifically designed for VSR. It is model-agnostic and stateless, and introduces a lightweight loss function based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to better preserve high-frequency details during local training. Additionally, a loss-aware aggregation strategy combines both DWT-based and task-specific losses to guide global updates effectively. Extensive experiments across multiple VSR models and datasets show that FedVSR not only improves perceptual video quality (up to +0.89 dB PSNR, +0.0370 SSIM, -0.0347 LPIPS and 4.98 VMAF) but also achieves these gains with close to zero computation and communication overhead compared to its rivals. These results demonstrate FedVSR's potential to bridge the gap between privacy, efficiency, and perceptual quality, setting a new benchmark for federated learning in low-level vision tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in the field of video understanding in recent times. Nevertheless, existing video benchmarks predominantly rely on text prompts for evaluation, which often require complex referential language and diminish both the accuracy and efficiency of human model interaction in turn. To address this limitation, we propose V2P-Bench, a robust and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the ability of LVLMs to understand Video Visual Prompts in human model interaction scenarios. V2P-Bench consists of 980 videos and 1172 well-structured high-quality QA pairs, each paired with manually annotated visual prompt frames. The benchmark spans three main tasks and twelve categories, thereby enabling fine-grained, instance-level evaluation. Through an in-depth analysis of current LVLMs, we identify several key findings: 1) Visual prompts are both more model-friendly and user-friendly in interactive scenarios than text prompts, leading to significantly improved model performance and enhanced user experience. 2) Models are reasonably capable of zero-shot understanding of visual prompts, but struggle with spatiotemporal understanding. Even o1 achieves only 71.8%, far below the human expert score of 88.3%, while most open-source models perform below 60%. 3) LVLMs exhibit pervasive Hack Phenomena in video question answering tasks, which become more pronounced as video length increases and frame sampling density decreases, thereby inflating performance scores artificially. We anticipate that V2P-Bench will not only shed light on these challenges but also serve as a foundational tool for advancing human model interaction and improving the evaluation of video understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.17736v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Overview of Low-Rank Structures in the Training and Adaptation of Large Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19859</link><description>arXiv:2503.19859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The substantial computational demands of modern large-scale deep learning present significant challenges for efficient training and deployment. Recent research has revealed a widespread phenomenon wherein deep networks inherently learn low-rank structures in their weights and representations during training. This tutorial paper provides a comprehensive review of advances in identifying and exploiting these low-rank structures, bridging mathematical foundations with practical applications. We present two complementary theoretical perspectives on the emergence of low-rankness: viewing it through the optimization dynamics of gradient descent throughout training, and understanding it as a result of implicit regularization effects at convergence. Practically, these theoretical perspectives provide a foundation for understanding the success of techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in fine-tuning, inspire new parameter-efficient low-rank training strategies, and explain the effectiveness of masked training approaches like dropout and masked self-supervised learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.19859v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Patronus: Interpretable Diffusion Models with Prototypes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22782</link><description>arXiv:2503.22782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncovering the opacity of diffusion-based generative models is urgently needed, as their applications continue to expand while their underlying procedures largely remain a black box. With a critical question -- how can the diffusion generation process be interpreted and understood? -- we proposed Patronus, an interpretable diffusion model that incorporates a prototypical network to encode semantics in visual patches, revealing what visual patterns are modeled and where and when they emerge throughout denoising. This interpretability of Patronus provides deeper insights into the generative mechanism, enabling the detection of shortcut learning via unwanted correlations and the tracing of semantic emergence across timesteps. We evaluate Patronus on four natural image datasets and one medical imaging dataset, demonstrating both faithful interpretability and strong generative performance. With this work, we open new avenues for understanding and steering diffusion models through prototype-based interpretability.\\ Our code is available at https://github.com/nina-weng/patronus}{https://github.com/nina-weng/patronus.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.22782v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language-Integrated Recursive Queries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02443</link><description>arXiv:2504.02443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performance-critical industrial applications, including large-scale program, network, and distributed system analyses, rely on fixed-point computations. The introduction of recursive common table expressions (CTEs) using the WITH RECURSIVE keyword in SQL:1999 extended the ability of relational database systems to handle fixed-point computations, unlocking significant performance advantages by allowing computation to move closer to the data. Yet with recursion, SQL becomes a Turing-complete programming language and, with that, unrecoverable safety and correctness risks. SQL itself lacks a fixed semantics, as the SQL specification is written in natural language, full of ambiguities that database vendors resolve in divergent ways. As a result, reasoning about the correctness of recursive SQL programs must rely on isolated mathematical properties of queries rather than wrestling a unified formal model out of a language with notoriously inconsistent semantics. To address these challenges, we propose a calculus that automatically derives mathematical properties from embedded recursive queries and, depending on the database backend, rejects queries that may lead to the three classes of recursive query errors - database errors, incorrect results, and non-termination. We introduce TyQL, a practical implementation in Scala for safe, recursive language-integrated query. Using Named-Tuples and type-level pattern matching, TyQL ensures query portability and safety, showing no performance penalty compared to raw SQL strings while unlocking a three-orders-of-magnitude speedup over non-recursive SQL queries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.02443v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GPG: A Simple and Strong Reinforcement Learning Baseline for Model Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02546</link><description>arXiv:2504.02546v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models without extensive reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this work, we revisit the traditional Policy Gradient (PG) mechanism and propose a minimalist RL approach termed Group Policy Gradient (GPG). Unlike conventional methods, GPG directly optimize the original RL objective, thus obviating the need for surrogate loss functions. By eliminating the critic and reference models, avoiding KL divergence constraints, and addressing the advantage and gradient estimation bias, our approach significantly simplifies the training process compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach achieves superior performance without relying on auxiliary techniques or adjustments. As illustrated in Figure 1, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only reduces computational costs but also consistently outperforms GRPO across various unimodal and multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Generating long, coherent text remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs), as they lack hierarchical planning and structured organization in discourse generation. We introduce Structural Alignment, a novel method that aligns LLMs with human-like discourse structures to enhance long-form text generation. By integrating linguistically grounded discourse frameworks into reinforcement learning, our approach guides models to produce coherent and well-organized outputs. We employ a dense reward scheme within a Proximal Policy Optimization framework, assigning fine-grained, token-level rewards based on the discourse distinctiveness relative to human writing. Two complementary reward models are evaluated: the first improves readability by scoring surface-level textual features to provide explicit structuring, while the second reinforces deeper coherence and rhetorical sophistication by analyzing global discourse patterns through hierarchical discourse motifs, outperforming both standard and RLHF-enhanced models in tasks such as essay generation and long-document summarization.

Motivated by Hoeffding's approach, which estimates the empirical distribution and uses it to construct the test statistic, we employ quantum state tomography to reconstruct the unknown state prior to forming the test statistic. Leveraging the concentration properties of quantum state tomography, we establish the exponential consistency of the proposed test: the type II error probability decays exponentially quickly, with the exponent determined by the trace distance between the true state and the nominal state.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.16299v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Crypto-ncRNA: a bio-inspired post-quantum cryptographic primitive exploiting RNA folding complexity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17878</link><description>arXiv:2504.17878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The imminent realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing precipitates a systemic collapse of classical public-key infrastructure and necessitates an urgent transition to post-quantum cryptography. However, current standardization efforts predominantly rely on structured mathematical problems that may remain vulnerable to unforeseen algorithmic breakthroughs, highlighting a critical need for fundamentally orthogonal security paradigms. Here, we introduce \emph{Crypto-ncRNA} as a biophysically inspired cryptographic primitive that exploits the thermodynamic complexity of non-coding RNA folding as a computational work-factor amplifier. By leveraging the rugged energy landscape inherent to RNA secondary structure prediction, a problem intractable to rapid inversion, we establish a security foundation independent of conventional number-theoretic assumptions. We validate this approach by mapping the folding problem to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization model and demonstrate theoretical resilience against quantum optimization attacks including the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Functioning as a symmetric key encapsulation and derivation primitive dependent on pre-shared seeds, Crypto-ncRNA achieves throughputs competitive with software-based Advanced Encryption Standard implementations. By utilizing the generated high-entropy keys within a standard stream cipher framework, it exhibits ciphertext entropy that satisfies rigorous NIST SP 800-22 statistical standards. These findings not only articulate a novel bio-computational pathway for cryptographic defense but also provide a rigorous algorithmic blueprint for future physical realization, demonstrating that the thermodynamic complexity of biological systems offers a robust and physically grounded frontier for securing digital infrastructure in the post-quantum era.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.17878v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Helpfulness-Harmlessness Alignment with Preference Vectors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20106</link><description>arXiv:2504.20106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are both helpful and harmless is a critical challenge, as overly strict constraints can lead to excessive refusals, while permissive models risk generating harmful content. Existing approaches, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO), attempt to balance these trade-offs but suffer from performance conflicts, limited controllability, and poor extendability. To address these issues, we propose Preference Vector, a novel framework inspired by task arithmetic. Instead of optimizing multiple preferences within a single objective, we train separate models on individual preferences, extract behavior shifts as preference vectors, and dynamically merge them at test time. This modular approach enables fine-grained, user-controllable preference adjustments and facilitates seamless integration of new preferences without retraining. Experiments show that our proposed Preference Vector framework improves helpfulness without excessive conservatism, allows smooth control over preference trade-offs, and supports scalable multi-preference alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.20106v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Advancing AI Research Assistants with Expert-Involved Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04638</link><description>arXiv:2505.04638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) promise to accelerate biomedical discovery, yet their reliability remains unclear. We introduce ARIEL (AI Research Assistant for Expert-in-the-Loop Learning), an open-source evaluation and optimization framework that pairs a curated multimodal biomedical corpus with expert-vetted tasks to probe two capabilities: full-length article summarization and fine-grained figure interpretation. Using uniform protocols and blinded PhD-level evaluation, we find that state-of-the-art models generate fluent but incomplete summaries, whereas LMMs struggle with detailed visual reasoning. We later observe that prompt engineering and lightweight fine-tuning substantially improve textual coverage, and a compute-scaled inference strategy enhances visual question answering. We build an ARIEL agent that integrates textual and visual cues, and we show it can propose testable mechanistic hypotheses. ARIEL delineates current strengths and limitations of foundation models, and provides a reproducible platform for advancing trustworthy AI in biomedicine.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.04638v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scene-Adaptive Motion Planning with Explicit Mixture of Experts and Interaction-Oriented Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12311</link><description>arXiv:2505.12311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite over a decade of development, autonomous driving trajectory planning in complex urban environments continues to encounter significant challenges. These challenges include the difficulty in accommodating the multi-modal nature of trajectories, the limitations of single expert model in managing diverse scenarios, and insufficient consideration of environmental interactions. To address these issues, this paper introduces the EMoE-Planner, which incorporates three innovative approaches. Firstly, the Explicit MoE (Mixture of Experts) dynamically selects specialized experts based on scenario-specific information through a shared scene router. Secondly, the planner utilizes scene-specific queries to provide multi-modal priors, directing the model's focus towards relevant target areas. Lastly, it enhances the prediction model and loss calculation by considering the interactions between the ego vehicle and other agents, thereby significantly boosting planning performance. Comparative experiments were conducted on the Nuplan dataset against the state-of-the-art methods. The simulation results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms SOTA models across nearly all test scenarios. Our model is the first pure learning model to achieve performance surpassing rule-based algorithms in almost all Nuplan closed-loop simulations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.12311v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link><description>arXiv:2505.12387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.12387v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SpecFLASH: A Latent-Guided Semi-autoregressive Speculative Decoding Framework for Efficient Multimodal Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12728</link><description>arXiv:2505.12728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models and large multimodal models (LLMs and LMMs) deliver strong generative performance but suffer from slow decoding, a problem that becomes more severe when handling visual inputs, whose sequences typically contain many more tokens with lower information density than text. Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by letting a compact draft model propose candidate tokens that are selectively accepted by a larger target model, achieving speed-up without degrading quality. However, existing multimodal speculative decoding approaches largely ignore the structural characteristics of visual representations and usually rely on text-only draft models. In this paper, we introduce SpecFLASH, a speculative decoding framework tailored to LMMs that explicitly exploits multimodal structure when designing the draft model. We first mitigate redundancy in visual token sequences with a lightweight, latent-guided token compression module that compacts visual features while preserving semantics, and then leverage the co-occurrence and local correlations of visual entities via a semi-autoregressive decoding scheme that predicts multiple tokens in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpecFLASH consistently surpasses prior speculative decoding baselines, achieving up to $2.68\times$ speed-up on video captioning and $2.55\times$ on visual instruction tuning, relative to the original LMM.

Abstract: Operator learning is a rapidly growing field that aims to approximate nonlinear operators related to partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural operators. These rely on discretization of input and output functions and are, usually, expensive to train for large-scale problems at high-resolution. Motivated by this, we present a Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) approach to train neural operators by leveraging a hierarchy of resolutions of function discretization. Our framework relies on using gradient corrections from fewer samples of fine-resolution data to decrease the computational cost of training while maintaining a high level accuracy. The proposed MLMC training procedure can be applied to any architecture accepting multi-resolution data. Our numerical experiments on a range of state-of-the-art models and test-cases demonstrate improved computational efficiency compared to traditional single-resolution training approaches, and highlight the existence of a Pareto curve between accuracy and computational time, related to the number of samples per resolution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.12940v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lightweight and Interpretable Transformer via Mixed Graph Algorithm Unrolling for Traffic Forecast</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13102</link><description>arXiv:2505.13102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike conventional "black-box" transformers with classical self-attention mechanism, we build a lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural net by unrolling a mixed-graph-based optimization algorithm to forecast traffic with spatial and temporal dimensions. We construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We predict future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We design an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We periodically insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$ that play the role of self-attention. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.13102v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inferring stochastic dynamics with growth from cross-sectional data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13197</link><description>arXiv:2505.13197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolved single-cell omics data offers high-throughput, genome-wide measurements of cellular states, which are instrumental to reverse-engineer the processes underpinning cell fate. Such technologies are inherently destructive, allowing only cross-sectional measurements of the underlying stochastic dynamical system. Furthermore, cells may divide or die in addition to changing their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach, unbalanced probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step training scheme.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.13197v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Building spatial world models from sparse transitional episodic memories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13696</link><description>arXiv:2505.13696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many animals possess a remarkable capacity to rapidly construct flexible cognitive maps of their environments. These maps are crucial for ethologically relevant behaviors such as navigation, exploration, and planning. Existing computational models typically require long sequential trajectories to build accurate maps, but neuroscience evidence suggests maps can also arise from integrating disjoint experiences governed by consistent spatial rules. We introduce the Episodic Spatial World Model (ESWM), a novel framework that constructs spatial maps from sparse, disjoint episodic memories. Across environments of varying complexity, ESWM predicts unobserved transitions from minimal experience, and the geometry of its latent space aligns with that of the environment. Because it operates on episodic memories that can be independently stored and updated, ESWM is inherently adaptive, enabling rapid adjustment to environmental changes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ESWM readily enables near-optimal strategies for exploring novel environments and navigating between arbitrary points, all without the need for additional training. Our work demonstrates how neuroscience-inspired principles of episodic memory can advance the development of more flexible and generalizable world models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.13696v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AudioJailbreak: Jailbreak Attacks against End-to-End Large Audio-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14103</link><description>arXiv:2505.14103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied recently, but they exclusively focused on the attack scenario where the adversary can fully manipulate user prompts (named strong adversary) and limited in effectiveness, applicability, and practicability. In this work, we first conduct an extensive evaluation showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to-speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AUDIOJAILBREAK, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audios do not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into the perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios is concealed by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating reverberation into the perturbation generation. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, and/or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AUDIOJAILBREAK is also applicable to a more practical and broader attack scenario where the adversary cannot fully manipulate user prompts (named weak adversary). Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AUDIOJAILBREAK, in particular, it can jailbreak openAI's GPT-4o-Audio and bypass Meta's Llama-Guard-3 safeguard, in the weak adversary scenario. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their robustness, especially for the newly proposed weak adversary.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.14103v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Abacus: A Cost-Based Optimizer for Semantic Operator Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14661</link><description>arXiv:2505.14661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs enable an exciting new class of data processing applications over large collections of unstructured documents. Several new programming frameworks have enabled developers to build these applications by composing them out of semantic operators: a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural language specifications. These include LLM-powered maps, filters, joins, etc. used for document processing tasks such as information extraction, summarization, and more. While systems of semantic operators have achieved strong performance on benchmarks, they can be difficult to optimize. An optimizer for this setting must determine how to physically implement each semantic operator in a way that optimizes the system globally. Existing optimizers are limited in the number of optimizations they can apply, and most (if not all) cannot optimize system quality, cost, or latency subject to constraint(s) on the other dimensions. In this paper we present Abacus, an extensible, cost-based optimizer which searches for the best implementation of a semantic operator system given a (possibly constrained) optimization objective. Abacus estimates operator performance by leveraging a minimal set of validation examples, prior beliefs about operator performance, and/or an LLM judge. We evaluate Abacus on document processing workloads in the biomedical and legal domains (BioDEX; CUAD) and multi-modal question answering (MMQA). We demonstrate that, on-average, systems optimized by Abacus achieve 6.7%-39.4% better quality and are 10.8x cheaper and 3.4x faster than the next best system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.14661v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPAR: Self-supervised Placement-Aware Representation Learning for Distributed Sensing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16936</link><description>arXiv:2505.16936v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SPAR, a framework for self-supervised placement-aware representation learning in distributed sensing. Distributed sensing spans applications where multiple spatially distributed and multimodal sensors jointly observe an environment, from vehicle monitoring to human activity recognition and earthquake localization. A central challenge shared by this wide spectrum of applications is that observed signals are inseparably shaped by sensor placements, including their spatial locations and structural characteristics. However, existing pretraining methods remain largely placement-agnostic. SPAR addresses this gap through a unifying principle: the duality between signals and positions. Guided by this principle, SPAR introduces spatial and structural positional embeddings together with dual reconstruction objectives, explicitly modeling how observing positions and observed signals shape each other. Placement is thus treated not as auxiliary metadata but as intrinsic to representation learning. SPAR is theoretically supported by analyses from information theory and occlusion-invariant learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SPAR achieves superior robustness and generalization across various modalities, placements, and downstream tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.16936v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MedFrameQA: A Multi-Image Medical VQA Benchmark for Clinical Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16964</link><description>arXiv:2505.16964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world clinical practice demands multi-image comparative reasoning, yet current medical benchmarks remain limited to single-frame interpretation. We present MedFrameQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to test multi-image medical VQA through educationally-validated diagnostic sequences. To construct this dataset, we develop a scalable pipeline that leverages narrative transcripts from medical education videos to align visual frames with textual concepts, automatically producing 2,851 high-quality multi-image VQA pairs with explicit, transcript-grounded reasoning chains. Our evaluation of 11 advanced MLLMs (including reasoning models) exposes severe deficiencies in multi-image synthesis, where accuracies mostly fall below 50% and exhibit instability across varying image counts. Error analysis demonstrates that models often treat images as isolated instances, failing to track pathological progression or cross-reference anatomical shifts. MedFrameQA provides a rigorous standard for evaluating the next generation of MLLMs in handling complex, temporally grounded medical narratives.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.16964v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Seeing through Satellite Images at Street Views</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17001</link><description>arXiv:2505.17001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the task of SatStreet-view synthesis, which aims to render photorealistic street-view panorama images and videos given any satellite image and specified camera positions or trajectories. We formulate to learn neural radiance field from paired images captured from satellite and street viewpoints, which comes to be a challenging learning problem due to the sparse-view natural and the extremely-large viewpoint changes between satellite and street-view images. We tackle the challenges based on a task-specific observation that street-view specific elements, including the sky and illumination effects are only visible in street-view panoramas, and present a novel approach Sat2Density++ to accomplish the goal of photo-realistic street-view panoramas rendering by modeling these street-view specific in neural networks. In the experiments, our method is testified on both urban and suburban scene datasets, demonstrating that Sat2Density++ is capable of rendering photorealistic street-view panoramas that are consistent across multiple views and faithful to the satellite image.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.17001v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Thalia: A Global, Multi-Modal Dataset for Volcanic Activity Monitoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17782</link><description>arXiv:2505.17782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring volcanic activity is of paramount importance to safeguarding lives, infrastructure, and ecosystems. However, only a small fraction of known volcanoes are continuously monitored. Satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) enables systematic, global-scale deformation monitoring. However, its complex data challenge traditional remote sensing methods. Deep learning offers a powerful means to automate and enhance InSAR interpretation, advancing volcanology and geohazard assessment. Despite its promise, progress has been limited by the scarcity of well-curated datasets. In this work, we build on the existing Hephaestus dataset and introduce Thalia, addressing crucial limitations and enriching its scope with higher-resolution, multi-source, and multi-temporal data. Thalia is a global collection of 38 spatiotemporal datacubes covering 7 years and integrating InSAR products, topographic data, as well as atmospheric variables, known to introduce signal delays that can mimic ground deformation in InSAR imagery. Each sample includes expert annotations detailing the type, intensity, and extent of deformation, ac- companied by descriptive text. To enable fair and consistent evaluation, we provide a comprehensive benchmark using state-of-the-art models for classification and segmentation. This work fosters collaboration between machine learning and Earth science, advancing volcanic monitoring and promoting data-driven approaches in geoscience.

Preferring Shorter Thinking Chains for Improved LLM Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17813</link><description>arXiv:2505.17813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on scaling test-time compute to perform complex reasoning tasks by generating extensive "thinking" chains. While demonstrating impressive results, this approach incurs significant computational costs and inference time. In this work, we challenge the assumption that long thinking chains results in better reasoning capabilities. We first demonstrate that shorter reasoning chains within individual questions are significantly more likely to yield correct answers - up to 34.5% more accurate than the longest chain sampled for the same question. Based on these results, we suggest short-m@k, a novel reasoning LLM inference method. Our method executes k independent generations in parallel and halts computation once the first m thinking processes are done. The final answer is chosen using majority voting among these m chains. Basic short-1@k demonstrates similar or even superior performance over standard majority voting in low-compute settings - using up to 40% fewer thinking tokens. short-3@k, while slightly less efficient than short-1@k, consistently surpasses majority voting across all compute budgets, while still being substantially faster (up to 33% wall time reduction). To further validate our findings, we finetune LLMs using short, long, and randomly selected reasoning chains. We then observe that training on the shorter ones leads to better performance. Our findings suggest rethinking current methods of test-time compute in reasoning LLMs, emphasizing that longer "thinking" does not necessarily translate to improved performance and can, counter-intuitively, lead to degraded results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.17813v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] v1: Learning to Point Visual Tokens for Multimodal Grounded Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18842</link><description>arXiv:2505.18842v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When thinking with images, humans rarely rely on a single glance: they revisit visual evidence while reasoning. In contrast, most Multimodal Language Models encode an image once to key-value cache and then reason purely in text, making it hard to re-ground intermediate steps. We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen, models progressively lose focus on relevant regions. We introduce v1, a lightweight extension for active visual referencing via point-and-copy: the model selects relevant image patches and copies their embeddings back into the reasoning stream. Crucially, our point-and-copy mechanism retrieves patches using their semantic representations as keys, ensuring perceptual evidence remains aligned with the reasoning space. To train this behavior, we build v1, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved grounding annotations. Across multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable baselines. We plan to release the model checkpoint and data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.18842v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CAD-SLAM: Consistency-Aware Dynamic SLAM with Dynamic-Static Decoupled Mapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19420</link><description>arXiv:2505.19420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural radiation fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian-based SLAM have achieved impressive localization accuracy and high-quality dense mapping in static scenes. However, these methods remain challenged in dynamic environments, where moving objects violate the static-world assumption and introduce inconsistent observations that degrade both camera tracking and map reconstruction. This motivates two fundamental problems: robustly identifying dynamic objects and modeling them online. To address these limitations, we propose CAD-SLAM, a Consistency-Aware Dynamic SLAM framework with dynamic-static decoupled mapping. Our key insight is that dynamic objects inherently violate cross-view and cross-time scene consistency. We detect object motion by analyzing geometric and texture discrepancies between historical map renderings and real-world observations. Once a moving object is identified, we perform bidirectional dynamic object tracking (both backward and forward in time) to achieve complete sequence-wise dynamic recognition. Our consistency-aware dynamic detection model achieves category-agnostic, instantaneous dynamic identification, which effectively mitigates motion-induced interference during localization and mapping. In addition, we introduce a dynamic-static decoupled mapping strategy that employs a temporal Gaussian model for online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate the flexible and accurate dynamic segmentation capabilities of our method, along with the state-of-the-art performance in both localization and mapping.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.19420v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ground-R1: Incentivizing Grounded Visual Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20272</link><description>arXiv:2505.20272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become powerful general-purpose assistants, yet their predictions often lack reliability and interpretability due to insufficient grounding in visual evidence. The emerging thinking-with-images paradigm seeks to address this issue by explicitly anchoring reasoning to image regions. However, we empirically find that most existing methods suffer from a systematic scale-driven bias in optimization, where training rewards are dominated by large visual regions, suppressing learning from small but semantically critical evidence and leading to spurious grounding at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose Ground-R1, a de-biased thinking-with-images framework trained via a novel Scale Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO) objective that replaces standard GRPO. Specifically, our SRPO recalibrates reward learning across evidence regions of different sizes through scale-aware binning and intra-/inter-bin comparisons, enabling balanced credit assignment during training. Experimental results on general LVLM, high-resolution, and visual grounding benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Ground-R1 and show that SRPO yields consistent gains over standard GRPO in both response accuracy and evidence grounding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.20272v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Position: Epistemic uncertainty estimation methods are fundamentally incomplete</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23506</link><description>arXiv:2505.23506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying and disentangling sources of predictive uncertainty is essential for trustworthy supervised learning. We argue that widely used second-order methods that disentangle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are fundamentally incomplete. First, we show that unaccounted bias contaminates uncertainty estimates by overestimating aleatoric (data-related) uncertainty and underestimating the epistemic (model-related) counterpart, leading to incorrect uncertainty quantification. Second, we demonstrate that existing methods capture only partial contributions to the variance-driven part of epistemic uncertainty; different approaches account for different variance sources, yielding estimates that are incomplete and difficult to interpret. Together, these results highlight that current epistemic uncertainty estimates can only be used in safety-critical and high-stakes decision-making when limitations are fully understood by end users and acknowledged by AI developers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.23506v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SEMNAV: Enhancing Visual Semantic Navigation in Robotics through Semantic Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01418</link><description>arXiv:2506.01418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Semantic Navigation (VSN) is a fundamental problem in robotics, where an agent must navigate toward a target object in an unknown environment, mainly using visual information. Most state-of-the-art VSN models are trained in simulation environments, where rendered scenes of the real world are used, at best. These approaches typically rely on raw RGB data from the virtual scenes, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world environments due to domain adaptation issues. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose SEMNAV, a novel approach that leverages semantic segmentation as the main visual input representation of the environment to enhance the agent's perception and decision-making capabilities. By explicitly incorporating this type of high-level semantic information, our model learns robust navigation policies that improve generalization across unseen environments, both in simulated and real world settings. We also introduce the SEMNAV dataset, a newly curated dataset designed for training semantic segmentation-aware navigation models like SEMNAV. Our approach is evaluated extensively in both simulated environments and with real-world robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMNAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art VSN models, achieving higher success rates in the Habitat 2.0 simulation environment, using the HM3D dataset. Furthermore, our real-world experiments highlight the effectiveness of semantic segmentation in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, making our model a promising solution for practical VSN-based robotic applications.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks provide a principled framework for incorporating symmetry into learning architectures and have been extensively analyzed through the lens of their separation power, that is, the ability to distinguish inputs modulo symmetry. This notion plays a central role in settings such as graph learning, where it is often formalized via the Weisfeiler-Leman hierarchy. In contrast, the universality of equivariant models-their capacity to approximate target functions-remains comparatively underexplored. In this work, we investigate the approximation power of equivariant neural networks beyond separation constraints. We show that separation power does not fully capture expressivity: models with identical separation power may differ in their approximation ability. To demonstrate this, we characterize the universality classes of shallow invariant networks, providing a general framework for understanding which functions these architectures can approximate. Since equivariant models reduce to invariant ones under projection, this analysis yields sufficient conditions under which shallow equivariant networks fail to be universal. Conversely, we identify settings where shallow models do achieve separation-constrained universality. These positive results, however, depend critically on structural properties of the symmetry group, such as the existence of adequate normal subgroups, which may not hold in important cases like permutation symmetry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.02293v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Relational reasoning and inductive bias in transformers and large language models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04289</link><description>arXiv:2506.04289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning remain poorly understood. We investigate how transformers perform \textit{transitive inference}, a classic relational reasoning task which requires inference indirectly related items (e.g., if $A&gt;B$ and $B&gt;C$, then $A&gt;C$), comparing in-weights learning (IWL) and in-context learning (ICL) strategies. We find that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards transitive inference despite training only on adjacent items, whereas ICL models develop induction circuits implementing match-and-copy strategies that fail to encode hierarchical relationships. However, when pre-trained on in-context linear regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable transitive inference, displaying both \textit{symbolic distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal performance, without forming induction circuits. We extend these findings to large language models, demonstrating that prompting with linear geometric scaffolds improves transitive inference, while circular geometries (which violate transitivity by allowing wraparound) impair performance, particularly when models cannot rely on stored knowledge. Together, these results reveal that both the training regime and the geometric structure of induced representations critically determine transformers' capacity for transitive inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04289v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NOBLE -- Neural Operator with Biologically-informed Latent Embeddings to Capture Experimental Variability in Biological Neuron Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04536</link><description>arXiv:2506.04536v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04536v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reward Model Interpretability via Optimal and Pessimal Tokens</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07326</link><description>arXiv:2506.07326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a crucial component in aligning large language models with human values. Significant attention has focused on using reward models as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models themselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning prompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We present a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive analysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining how different reward models score every possible single-token response to value-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial heterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic asymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant sensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv) overvaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten recent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures. Our results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward models, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and context-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning biases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended consequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating through the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.07326v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differentially Private Relational Learning with Entity-level Privacy Guarantees</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08347</link><description>arXiv:2506.08347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning with relational and network-structured data is increasingly vital in sensitive domains where protecting the privacy of individual entities is paramount. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled approach for quantifying privacy risks, with DP-SGD emerging as a standard mechanism for private model training. However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational learning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate in multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity; and (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially coupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy amplification analyses inapplicable. This work presents a principled framework for relational learning with formal entity-level DP guarantees. We provide a rigorous sensitivity analysis and introduce an adaptive gradient clipping scheme that modulates clipping thresholds based on entity occurrence frequency. We also extend the privacy amplification results to a tractable subclass of coupled sampling, where the dependence arises only through sample sizes. These contributions lead to a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data with provable privacy guarantees. Experiments on fine-tuning text encoders over text-attributed network-structured relational data demonstrate the strong utility-privacy trade-offs of our approach.

Abstract: There has been considerable interest in using surprisal from Transformer-based language models (LMs) as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work has observed an inverse scaling relationship between Transformers' per-word estimated probability and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading times, showing that LMs with more parameters and trained on more data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focused on predicting latency-based measures. Tests on brain imaging data have not shown a trend in any direction when using a relatively small set of LMs, leaving open the possibility that the inverse scaling phenomenon is constrained to latency data. This study therefore conducted a more comprehensive evaluation using surprisal estimates from 17 pre-trained LMs across three different LM families on two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. Results show that the inverse scaling relationship between models' per-word estimated probability and model fit on both datasets still obtains, resolving the inconclusive results of previous work and indicating that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.11338v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sharpness-Aware Machine Unlearning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13715</link><description>arXiv:2506.13715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the effectiveness of Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) under machine unlearning scheme, where unlearning forget signals interferes with learning retain signals. While previous work prove that SAM improves generalization with noise memorization prevention, we show that SAM abandons such denoising property when fitting the forget set, leading to altered generalization depending on signal strength. We further characterize the signal surplus of SAM in the order of signal strength, which enables learning from less retain signals to maintain model performance and putting more weight on unlearning the forget set. Empirical studies show that SAM outperforms SGD with relaxed requirement for retain signals and can enhance various unlearning methods either as pretrain or unlearn algorithm. Motivated by our refined characterization of SAM unlearning and observing that overfitting can benefit more stringent sample-specific unlearning, we propose Sharp MinMax, which splits the model into two to learn retain signals with SAM and unlearn forget signals with sharpness maximization, achieving best performance. Extensive experiments show that SAM enhances unlearning across varying difficulties measured by memorization, yielding decreased feature entanglement between retain and forget sets, stronger resistance to membership inference attacks, and a flatter loss landscape. Our observations generalize to more noised data, different optimizers, and different architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.13715v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SurgVidLM: Towards Multi-grained Surgical Video Understanding with Large Language Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17873</link><description>arXiv:2506.17873v3 Announce Type: replace

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great potential for advancing scene perception in the medical domain, facilitating surgeons to understand surgical scenes and procedures. However, these methods are primarily oriented towards image-based analysis or global video understanding, overlooking the fine-grained video reasoning that is crucial for analyzing specific processes and capturing detailed task execution within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM, the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K that is a large-scale dataset with over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures. Building on this resource, SurgVidLM incorporates a two-stage StageFocus mechanism: the first stage extracts global procedural context, while the second stage performs high-frequency local analysis guided by temporal cues. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively integrate low- and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the preservation of critical task-specific details. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs of comparable parameter scale in both full and fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in capturing the context of complex robot-assisted surgeries. Our code and dataset will be publicly accessible soon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.17873v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sensitivity analysis of image classification models using generalized polynomial chaos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18751</link><description>arXiv:2506.18751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification model used in BMW Group production facilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.18751v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Broken Tokens?

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single "canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4% of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and 90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance, finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall, our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization at inference time to boost performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.19004v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lightweight RGB-T Tracking with Mobile Vision Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19154</link><description>arXiv:2506.19154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-modality tracking (RGB-only) struggles under low illumination, weather, and occlusion. Multimodal tracking addresses this by combining complementary cues. While Vision Transformer-based trackers achieve strong accuracy, they are often too large for real-time. We propose a lightweight RGB-T tracker built on MobileViT with a progressive fusion framework that models intra- and inter-modal interactions using separable mixed attention. This design delivers compact, effective features for accurate localization, with under 4M parameters and real-time performance of 25.7 FPS on the CPU and 122 FPS on the GPU, supporting embedded and mobile platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MobileViT-based multimodal tracker. Model code and weights are available in the GitHub repository.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.19154v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21551</link><description>arXiv:2506.21551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first study of grokking in practical LLM pretraining. Specifically, we investigate when an LLM memorizes the training data, when its generalization on downstream tasks starts to improve, and what happens if there is a lag between the two. Unlike existing works studying when a small model generalizes to limited and specified tasks during thousands epochs' training on algorithmic data, we focus on a practical setting for LLMs, i.e., one-epoch pretraining of next-token prediction on a cross-domain, large-scale corpus, and generalization on diverse benchmark tasks covering math/commonsense reasoning, code generation, and domain-specific retrieval. Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still emerges in pretraining mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs, though different local data groups may enter their grokking stages asynchronously due to the heterogeneity of their distributions and attributions to others. To find a mechanistic interpretation of this local grokking, we investigate the dynamics of training data's pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers in MoE). Our primary discovery is that the pathways evolve from random, non-smooth across layers, instance-specific to more structured and transferable across samples, despite the converged pretraining loss. This depicts a transition from memorization to generalization. Two novel metrics are developed to quantify these patterns: one computes the pathway similarity between samples, while the other measures the consistency of aggregated experts between subsequent layers for each sample. These training data based metrics induce zero cost but can faithfully track and monitor the generalization of LLMs on downstream tasks, which, in conventional settings, requires costly instruction tuning and benchmark evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.21551v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Verbatim Memorization in LLMs Through Circuit Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21588</link><description>arXiv:2506.21588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits -- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started, while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation. Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across different text domains, while memorization induction appears more context-dependent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.21588v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Scoring Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22316</link><description>arXiv:2506.22316v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "LLM-as-a-Judge" paradigm, using Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators, is pivotal to LLM development, offering scalable feedback for complex tasks. However, the reliability of these judges is compromised by various biases. Existing research has heavily concentrated on biases in comparative evaluations. In contrast, scoring-based evaluations-which assign an absolute score and are often more practical in industrial applications-remain under-investigated. To address this gap, we undertake the first dedicated examination of scoring bias in LLM judges. We shift the focus from biases tied to the evaluation targets to those originating from the scoring prompt itself. We formally define scoring bias and identify three novel, previously unstudied types: rubric order bias, score ID bias, and reference answer score bias. We propose a comprehensive framework to quantify these biases, featuring a suite of multi-faceted metrics and an automatic data synthesis pipeline to create a tailored evaluation corpus. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that even the most advanced LLMs suffer from these substantial scoring biases. Our analysis yields actionable insights for designing more robust scoring prompts and mitigating these newly identified biases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.22316v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Proteus-ID: ID-Consistent and Motion-Coherent Video Customization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23729</link><description>arXiv:2506.23729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2) generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance. Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench, a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150 individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark for video identity customization.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting dynamics of the physical world can enhance a robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of generated videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. Through this geometric supervision, the model learns a shared 3D scene representation, enabling it to generate spatio-temporally aligned future video sequences from novel viewpoints given a single RGB-D image per view, and without relying on camera poses as input. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, yielding robot manipulation policies that generalize well to novel camera viewpoints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.01099v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] No time to train!

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors, as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1) memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.02798v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DOME: Improving Signal-to-Noise in Stochastic Gradient Descent via Sharp-Direction Subspace Filtering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03545</link><description>arXiv:2507.03545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gradients for deep neural networks exhibit strong correlations along the optimization trajectory, and are often aligned with a small set of Hessian eigenvectors associated with outlier eigenvalues. Recent work shows that projecting gradients away from this Hessian outlier subspace has little impact on optimization, despite capturing a large fraction of gradient variability. Since computing the Hessian is intractable in practice, we introduce a principled first-order characterization of the nuisance subspace based on the covariance of stochastic gradients, and propose an efficient method to estimate it online. We show that removing this subspace also has little impact on optimization, and yields practical benefits for applications sensitive to gradient signal-to-noise ratio such as gradient compression.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.03545v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accurate and Efficient World Modeling with Masked Latent Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04075</link><description>arXiv:2507.04075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.04075v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Generalization Ridge: Information Flow in Natural Language Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05387</link><description>arXiv:2507.05387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language generation (NLG), yet their internal mechanisms for synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap, we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations and target outputs-varies across depth during training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in intermediate layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers, reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further investigate this phenomenon, we conduct a set of complementary analyses that leverage residual scaling, attention pattern, and controlled model capacity to characterize layer-wise functional specialization. We further validate our findings with multiple-token generation experiments, verifying that the observed ridge phenomenon persists across decoding steps. Together, these findings offer new insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.05387v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ECORE: Energy-Conscious Optimized Routing for Deep Learning Models at the Edge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06011</link><description>arXiv:2507.06011v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge computing enables data processing closer to the source, significantly reducing latency, an essential requirement for real-time vision-based analytics such as object detection in surveillance and smart city environments. However, these tasks place substantial demands on resource-constrained edge devices, making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies, including a novel estimation-based techniques and an innovative greedy selection algorithm, to direct image processing requests to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, comparing against widely used baseline techniques. The evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD, EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by 35% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy compared to accuracy-centric methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.06011v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Temporal Motif Participation Profiles for Analyzing Node Similarity in Temporal Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06465</link><description>arXiv:2507.06465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal networks consisting of timestamped interactions between a set of nodes provide a useful representation for analyzing complex networked systems that evolve over time. Beyond pairwise interactions between nodes, temporal motifs capture patterns of higher-order interactions such as directed triangles over short time periods. We propose temporal motif participation profiles (TMPPs) to capture the behavior of nodes in temporal motifs. Two nodes with similar TMPPs take similar positions within temporal motifs, possibly with different nodes. TMPPs serve as unsupervised embeddings for nodes in temporal networks that are directly interpretable, as each entry denotes the frequency at which a node participates in a particular position in a specific temporal motif. We demonstrate that clustering TMPPs reveals groups of nodes with similar roles in a temporal network through simulation experiments and a case study on a network of militarized interstate disputes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.06465v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AICrypto: Evaluating Cryptography Capabilities of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09580</link><description>arXiv:2507.09580v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains. However, their applications in cryptography, which serve as a foundational pillar of cybersecurity, remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we build \textbf{AICrypto}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cryptography capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprises 135 multiple-choice questions, 150 capture-the-flag challenges, and 30 proof problems, covering a broad range of skills from knowledge memorization to vulnerability exploitation and formal reasoning. All tasks are carefully reviewed or constructed by cryptography experts to improve correctness and rigor. For each proof problem, we provide detailed scoring rubrics and reference solutions that enable automated grading, achieving high correlation with human expert evaluations. We introduce strong human expert performance baselines for comparison across all task types. Our evaluation of 17 leading LLMs reveals that state-of-the-art models match or even surpass human experts in memorizing cryptographic concepts, exploiting common vulnerabilities, and routine proofs. However, our analysis reveals that they still lack a deep understanding of abstract mathematical concepts and struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning and dynamic analysis. We hope this work could provide insights for future research on LLMs in cryptographic applications.

Abstract: Real-world task planning requires long-horizon reasoning over large sets of objects with complex relationships and attributes, leading to a combinatorial explosion for classical symbolic planners. To prune the search space, recent methods prioritize searching on a simplified task only containing a few ``important" objects predicted by a neural network. However, such a simple neuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration risks omitting critical objects and wasting resources on unsolvable simplified tasks. To enable Fast and reliable planning, we introduce a NeSy relaxation strategy (Flax), combining neural importance prediction with symbolic expansion. Specifically, we first learn a graph neural network to predict object importance to create a simplified task and solve it with a symbolic planner. Then, we solve a rule-relaxed task to obtain a quick rough plan, and reintegrate all referenced objects into the simplified task to recover any overlooked but essential elements. Finally, we apply complementary rules to refine the updated task, keeping it both reliable and compact. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world maze navigation benchmarks where a robot must traverse through a maze and interact with movable obstacles. The results show that Flax boosts the average success rate by 20.82\% and cuts mean wall-clock planning time by 17.65\% compared with the state-of-the-art NeSy baseline. We expect that Flax offers a practical path toward fast, scalable, long-horizon task planning in complex environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.15975v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PALM: PAnoramic Learning Map Integrating Learning Analytics and Curriculum Map for Scalable Insights Across Courses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18393</link><description>arXiv:2507.18393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes and evaluates the PAnoramic Learning Map (PALM), a learning analytics (LA) dashboard designed to address the scalability challenges of LA by integrating curriculum-level information. Traditional LA research has predominantly focused on individual courses or learners and often lacks a framework that considers the relationships between courses and the long-term trajectory of learning. To bridge this gap, PALM was developed to integrate multilayered educational data into a curriculum map, enabling learners to intuitively understand their learning records and academic progression. We conducted a system evaluation to assess PALM's effectiveness in two key areas: (1) its impact on students' awareness of their learning behaviors, and (2) its comparative performance against existing systems. The results indicate that PALM enhances learners' awareness of study planning and reflection, particularly by improving perceived behavioral control through the visual presentation of individual learning histories and statistical trends, which clarify the links between learning actions and outcomes. Although PALM requires ongoing refinement as a system, it received significantly higher evaluations than existing systems in terms of visual appeal and usability. By serving as an information resource with previously inaccessible insights, PALM enhances self-regulated learning and engagement, representing a significant step beyond conventional LA toward a comprehensive and scalable approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.18393v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Kimi K2: Open Agentic Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20534</link><description>arXiv:2507.20534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.
  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in non-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding, mathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6, 49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without extended thinking.

Across several state-of-the-art LLMs and diverse texts, the curves expose distinctive, stable profiles that depend on both model scale and text complexity.

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO and DanceGRPO still exhibit inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose $\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for faster sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.21802v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Foveate: Enhancing Diversity and Difficulty of Synthesized Instructions from Unsupervised Text via Multi-Level Foveation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23440</link><description>arXiv:2507.23440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality instruction data from unsupervised text is a promising paradigm for training large language models (LLMs), yet automated methods for this task still exhibit significant limitations in the diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an LLM-driven method for instruction synthesis. Inspired by hierarchical human visual perception, Self-Foveate introduces a "Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that guides the extraction of textual information at three complementary granularities, from fine-grained details through cross-region connections to holistic patterns, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. Furthermore, a re-synthesis module is incorporated to improve the fidelity of instructions to source text and their overall quality. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora and diverse model architectures demonstrate that Self-Foveate consistently outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. To address these issues, we propose CcGAN-AVAR, an enhanced CcGAN framework featuring (1) two novel components for handling data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism that dynamically adjusts vicinity size and a multi-task discriminator that enhances generator training through auxiliary regression and density ratio estimation - and (2) the GAN framework's native one-step generator, enable 30x-2000x faster inference than CCDM. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 256x256 resolution) across eleven challenging settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.01725v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Context Adaptation for Consistent Role-Playing Agents with Retrieval-Augmented Generations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02016</link><description>arXiv:2508.02016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building role-playing agents (RPAs) that faithfully emulate specific characters remains challenging because collecting character-specific utterances and continually updating model parameters are resource-intensive, making retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) a practical necessity. However, despite the importance of RAG, there has been little research on RAG-based RPAs. For example, we empirically find that when a persona lacks knowledge relevant to a given query, RAG-based RPAs are prone to hallucination, making it challenging to generate accurate responses. In this paper, we propose Amadeus, a training-free framework that can significantly enhance persona consistency even when responding to questions that lie beyond a character's knowledge. In addition, to underpin the development and rigorous evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we manually construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question-answer pairs. We find that our proposed method effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by characters, but also various attributes such as personality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.02016v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Eye2Recall: Exploring the Design of Enhancing Reminiscence Activities via Eye Tracking-Based LLM-Powered Interaction Experience for Older Adults</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02232</link><description>arXiv:2508.02232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photo-based reminiscence has the potential to have a positive impact on older adults' reconnection with their personal history and improve their well-being. Supporting reminiscence in older adults through technological implementations is becoming an increasingly important area of research in the fields of HCI and CSCW. However, the impact of integrating gaze and speech as mixed-initiative interactions in LLM-powered reminiscence conversations remains under-explored. To address this, we conducted expert interviews to understand the challenges that older adults face with LLM-powered, photo-based reminiscence experiences. Based on these design considerations, we developed Eye2Recall, a system that integrates eye tracking for detecting visual interest with natural language interaction to create a mixed-initiative reminiscence experience. We evaluated its effectiveness through a user study involving ten older adults. The results have important implications for the future design of more accessible and empowering reminiscence technologies that better align with older adults' natural interaction patterns and enhance their positive aging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.02232v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Affine-Equivariant Kernel Space Encoding for NeRF Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831</link><description>arXiv:2508.02831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural scene representations achieve high-fidelity rendering by encoding 3D scenes as continuous functions, but their latent spaces are typically implicit and globally entangled, making localized editing and physically grounded manipulation difficult. While several works introduce explicit control structures or point-based latent representations to improve editability, these approaches often suffer from limited locality, sensitivity to deformations, or visual artifacts. In this paper, we introduce Affine-Equivariant Kernel Space Encoding (EKS), a spatial encoding for neural radiance fields that provides localized, deformation-aware feature representations. Instead of querying latent features directly at discrete points or grid vertices, our encoding aggregates features through a field of anisotropic Gaussian kernels, each defining a localized region of influence. This kernel-based formulation enables stable feature interpolation under spatial transformations while preserving continuity and high reconstruction quality. To preserve detail without sacrificing editability, we further propose a training-time feature distillation mechanism that transfers information from multi-resolution hash grid encodings into the kernel field, yielding a compact and fully grid-free representation at inference. This enables intuitive, localized scene editing directly via Gaussian kernels without retraining, while maintaining high-quality rendering.

Abstract: Lifelong Person Re-identification (LReID) aims to continuously match individuals across camera views from sequential data streams. Existing LReID methods often ignore domain-specific style awareness and unified knowledge consolidation, which are crucial for mitigating forgetting when adapting to new information. We propose DSKC, a novel rehearsal-free and distillation-free framework for LReID. DSKC designs a domain-style encoder (DSE) to dynamically model domain-specific styles, and a unified knowledge consolidation (UKC) mechanism to adaptively integrate instance-level representations with domain-specific style into a cross-domain unified representation. By leveraging unified representation as a bridge, DSKC explicitly models inter-domain associations at both instance and domain levels to enhance anti-forgetting and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our DSKC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in two training orders and enhances the model's strong performance.

Abstract: Accurately classifying the application types of network traffic using deep learning models has recently gained popularity. However, we find that these classifiers do not perform well on real-world traffic data due to the presence of non-application-specific generic background traffic originating from advertisements, analytics, shared APIs, and trackers. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art application classifiers overlook such traffic in curated datasets and only classify relevant application traffic. To address this issue, when we label and train using an additional class for background traffic, it leads to additional confusion between application and background traffic, as the latter is heterogeneous and encompasses all traffic that is not relevant to the application sessions. To avoid falsely classifying background traffic as one of the relevant application types, a reliable confidence measure is warranted, such that we can refrain from classifying uncertain samples. Therefore, we design a Gaussian Mixture Model-based classification framework that improves the indication of the deep learning classifier's confidence to allow more reliable classification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.03891v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Novel Hierarchical Co-Optimization Framework for Coordinated Task Scheduling and Power Dispatch in Computing Power Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04015</link><description>arXiv:2508.04015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of large-scale AI and data-intensive applications has driven the development of Computing Power Networks (CPN). It is a key paradigm for delivering ubiquitous, on-demand computational services with high efficiency. However, CPNs face dual challenges in service computing. Immense energy consumption threatens sustainable operations. And the integration with power grids also features high penetration of intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (RES), complicating task scheduling while ensuring Quality of Service (QoS). To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Two-Stage Co-Optimization (TSCO) framework. It synergistically coordinates CPN task scheduling and power system dispatch, aiming to optimize service performance while achieving low-carbon operations. The framework decomposes the complex, large-scale problem into a day-ahead stochastic unit commitment stage and a real-time operational stage. The former is solved using Benders decomposition for computational tractability, while in the latter, economic dispatch of generation assets is coupled with an adaptive CPN task scheduling managed by a deep reinforcement learning agent. It makes carbon-aware decisions by responding to dynamic grid conditions, including real-time electricity prices and marginal carbon intensity. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the TSCO outperforms baseline approaches significantly. It reduces carbon emissions by 16.2% and operational costs by 12.7%, while decreasing RES curtailment by over $60\%$, maintaining a task success rate of 98.5%, and minimizing average task tardiness to 12.3s. This work advances cross-domain service optimization in CPNs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.04015v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniFGVC: Universal Training-Free Few-Shot Fine-Grained Vision Classification via Attribute-Aware Multimodal Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04136</link><description>arXiv:2508.04136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12 FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.04136v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privacy-Aware Predictions in Participatory Budgeting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06577</link><description>arXiv:2508.06577v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: The evaluation of code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by two intertwined challenges: a reliance on static, easily contaminated problem sources and the use of superficial, low-rigor testing. This paper introduces a new benchmark construction philosophy, Dual Scaling, designed to systematically address both limitations. Our approach involves continuously scaling the source of problems from dynamic, real-world code repositories and systematically scaling the rigor of tests via automated, high-coverage Property-Based Testing (PBT). We instantiate this philosophy in CODE2BENCH, an end-to-end framework that leverages Scope Graph analysis for principled dependency classification and a 100% branch coverage quality gate to ensure test suite integrity. Using this framework, we construct CODE2BENCH-2509, a new benchmark suite with native instances in both Python and Java. Our extensive evaluation of 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on CODE2BENCH-2509, powered by a novel "diagnostic fingerprint" visualization, yields three key insights: (1) models exhibit a fundamental performance gap, excelling at API application (Weakly Self-Contained tasks) but struggling with algorithmic synthesis (Self-Contained tasks); (2) a model's performance is profoundly shaped by the target language's ecosystem, a nuance we are the first to systematically quantify; and (3) our rigorous, scaled testing is critical in uncovering an "illusion of correctness" prevalent in simpler benchmarks. Our work presents a robust, scalable, and diagnostic paradigm for the next generation of LLM evaluation in software engineering.

Abstract: The translation of natural language to formal constraint models requires expertise in the problem domain and modeling frameworks. To explore the effectiveness of agentic workflows, we propose CP-Agent, a Python coding agent that uses the ReAct framework with a persistent IPython kernel. We provide the relevant domain knowledge as a project prompt of under 50 lines. The algorithm works by iteratively executing code, observing the solver's feedback, and refining constraint models based on execution results.
  We evaluate CP-Agent on 101 constraint programming problems from CP-Bench. We made minor changes to the benchmark to address systematic ambiguities in the problem specifications and errors in the ground-truth models. On the clarified benchmark, CP-Agent achieves perfect accuracy on all 101 problems. Our experiments show that minimal guidance outperforms detailed procedural scaffolding. Our experiments also show that explicit task management tools can have both positive and negative effects on focused modeling tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.07468v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Full Candidate Interaction: A Comprehensive Comparison Network for Better Route Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08745</link><description>arXiv:2508.08745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Route Recommendation (RR) is a core task in route planning within online navigation applications, aiming to recommend the optimal route among candidate routes to users. Industrially, RR adopts the two-stage recall-and-rank framework instead of traditional route planning algorithms primarily for computational efficiency. However, RR fundamentally differs from traditional recommendation systems that follow this paradigm. First, a primary challenge is that route items cannot be assigned unique identifiers. Additionally, RR fundamentally differs from traditional recommendation systems in its approach to feature interaction. These differences render conventional recommendation approaches inadequate for route recommendation scenarios, necessitating specialized methods that can effectively handle route-specific challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called Comprehensive Comparison Network (CCN) for route recommendation. CCN constructs comparative features by comparing non-overlapping segments between route pairs, enabling difference learning without the infinite scalability issues of ID embeddings. Furthermore, CCN employs a specially designed Comprehensive Comparison Block (CCB) that differs from previous item attention methods to achieve effective cross-interaction between routes using comparison-level features. Moreover, we develop an interpretable Pair Scoring Network (PSN) for route recommendation and introduce a more comprehensive route recommendation dataset to advance research in this field. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and CCN has been successfully deployed in AMAP for over a year, demonstrating its value in route recommendation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.08745v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training-Free Text-Guided Color Editing with Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09131</link><description>arXiv:2508.09131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions. Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency. Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1 Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages, particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally, our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.09131v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Object Fidelity Diffusion for Remote Sensing Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10801</link><description>arXiv:2508.10801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase. Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10801v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13755</link><description>arXiv:2508.13755v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.13755v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14330</link><description>arXiv:2508.14330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.18742v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Variance Paradox: How AI Reduces Diversity but Increases Novelty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19264</link><description>arXiv:2508.19264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diversity of human expression is the raw material of discovery. Generative artificial intelligence threatens this resource even as it promises to accelerate innovation, a paradox now visible across science, culture, and professional work. We propose a framework to explain this tension. AI systems compress informational variance through statistical optimization, and users amplify this effect through epistemic deference. We call this process the AI Prism. Yet this same compression can enable novelty. Standardized forms travel across domain boundaries, lowering translation costs and creating opportunities for recombination that we term the Paradoxical Bridge. The interaction produces a U-shaped temporal dynamic, an initial decline in diversity followed by recombinant innovation, but only when humans actively curate rather than passively defer. The framework generates testable predictions about when compression constrains versus amplifies creativity. As AI becomes infrastructure for knowledge work, managing this dynamic is essential. Without intervention, the conditions for recovery may not arrive.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19264v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Routers, Switches and Interconnects Compute: A processing-in-interconnect Paradigm for Scalable Neuromorphic AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19548</link><description>arXiv:2508.19548v3 Announce Type: replace

While this fabric plays only a supporting role in the process of computing, for large AI workloads, this fabric ultimately determines the overall system's performance, such as energy consumption and speed. In this paper, we offer a potential solution to address this bottleneck by addressing two fundamental questions: (a) What computing paradigms are inherent in existing routing, switching, and interconnect systems, and how can they be used to implement a Processing-in-Interconnect ($\pi^2$) computing paradigm? and (b) How to train $\pi^2$ network on standard AI benchmarks? To address the first question, we demonstrate that all operations required for typical AI workloads can be mapped onto delays, causality, time-outs, packet drops, and broadcast operations, all of which are already implemented in current packet-switching and packet-routing hardware. {We then show that existing buffering and traffic-shaping embedded algorithms can be minimally modified to implement $\pi^2$ neuron models and synaptic operations. To address the second question, we show how a knowledge distillation framework can be used to train and cross-map well-established neural network topologies onto $\pi^2$ architectures without any degradation in the generalization performance. Our analysis show that the effective energy utilization of a $\pi^2$ network is significantly higher than that of other neuromorphic computing platforms; as a result, we believe that the $\pi^2$ paradigm offers a more scalable architectural path toward achieving brain-scale AI inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19548v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Correspondence-Free, Function-Based Sim-to-Real Learning for Deformable Surface Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00060</link><description>arXiv:2509.00060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation function space and a confidence map -- both parameterized by a neural network -- to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of our method on both vision devices and across four pneumatically actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft manipulators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.00060v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty-driven Adaptive Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03219</link><description>arXiv:2509.03219v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across several environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.03219v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spiking Neural Networks for Continuous Control via End-to-End Model-Based Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05356</link><description>arXiv:2509.05356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for classification, their application to continuous motor control remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that fully spiking architectures can be trained end-to-end to control robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom in continuous environments. Our predictive-control framework combines Leaky Integrate-and-Fire dynamics with surrogate gradients, jointly optimizing a forward model for dynamics prediction and a policy network for goal-directed action. We evaluate this approach on both a planar 2D reaching task and a simulated 6-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot with torque control. In direct comparison to non-spiking recurrent baselines trained under the same predictive-control pipeline, the proposed SNN achieves comparable task performance while using substantially fewer parameters. An extensive ablation study highlights the role of initialization, learnable time constants, adaptive thresholds, and latent-space compression as key contributors to stable training and effective control. Together, these findings establish spiking neural networks as a viable and scalable substrate for high-dimensional continuous control, while emphasizing the importance of principled architectural and training design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.05356v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TurboFuzz: FPGA Accelerated Hardware Fuzzing for Processor Agile Verification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10400</link><description>arXiv:2509.10400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verification is a critical process for ensuring the correctness of modern processors. The increasing complexity of processor designs and the emergence of new instruction set architectures (ISAs) like RISC-V have created demands for more agile and efficient verification methodologies, particularly regarding verification efficiency and faster coverage convergence. While simulation-based approaches now attempt to incorporate advanced software testing techniques such as fuzzing to improve coverage, they face significant limitations when applied to processor verification, notably poor performance and inadequate test case quality. Hardware-accelerated solutions using FPGA or ASIC platforms have tried to address these issues, yet they struggle with challenges including host-FPGA communication overhead, inefficient test pattern generation, and suboptimal implementation of the entire multi-step verification process.
  In this paper, we present TurboFuzz, an end-to-end hardware-accelerated verification framework that implements the entire Test Generation-Simulation-Coverage Feedback loop on a single FPGA for modern processor verification. TurboFuzz enhances test quality through optimized test case (seed) control flow, efficient inter-seed scheduling, and hybrid fuzzer integration, thereby improving coverage and execution efficiency. Additionally, it employs a feedback-driven generation mechanism to accelerate coverage convergence. Experimental results show that TurboFuzz achieves up to 2.23x more coverage collection than software-based fuzzers within the same time budget, and up to 571x performance speedup when detecting real-world issues, while maintaining full visibility and debugging capabilities with moderate area overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.10400v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evalet: Evaluating Large Language Models by Fragmenting Outputs into Functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11206</link><description>arXiv:2509.11206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practitioners increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate generative AI outputs through "LLM-as-a-Judge" approaches. However, these methods produce holistic scores that obscure which specific elements influenced the assessments. We propose functional fragmentation, a method that dissects each output into key fragments and interprets the rhetoric functions that each fragment serves relative to evaluation criteria -- surfacing the elements of interest and revealing how they fulfill or hinder user goals. We instantiate this approach in Evalet, an interactive system that visualizes fragment-level functions across many outputs to support inspection, rating, and comparison of evaluations. A user study (N=10) found that, while practitioners struggled to validate holistic scores, our approach helped them identify 48% more evaluation misalignments. This helped them calibrate trust in LLM evaluations and rely on them to find more actionable issues in model outputs. Our work shifts LLM evaluation from quantitative scores toward qualitative, fine-grained analysis of model behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11206v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MAPGD: Multi-Agent Prompt Gradient Descent for Collaborative Prompt Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11361</link><description>arXiv:2509.11361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for fully leveraging large language models (LLMs), yet most existing optimization methods follow a single trajectory, resulting in limited adaptability, gradient conflicts, and high computational overhead. We propose MAPGD (Multi-Agent Prompt Gradient Descent), a novel framework that reconceptualizes prompt optimization as a collaborative process among specialized agents. Each agent focuses on a distinct refinement dimension, such as instruction clarity, example selection, format structure, or stylistic adaptation, and their contributions are coordinated through semantic gradient embedding, conflict detection, and fusion. To further enhance robustness and stability, MAPGD introduces two new mechanisms: Hypersphere Constrained Gradient Clustering (HCGC), which enforces angular margin constraints for compact and well-separated clusters, and Channel Adaptive Agent Weighting (CAAW), which dynamically reweights agent contributions based on validation performance. Experiments on classification and reasoning benchmarks show that MAPGD consistently surpasses single-agent and random baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of gradient fusion, agent specialization, and conflict resolution. Together, these components establish MAPGD as a unified, gradient-based, and interpretable framework for robust prompt optimization with theoretical convergence guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11361v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LazyDrag: Enabling Stable Drag-Based Editing on Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers via Explicit Correspondence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12203</link><description>arXiv:2509.12203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core bottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on weakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models, suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper, we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach: opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects like a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to editing paradigms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.12203v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interaction Context Often Increases Sycophancy in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12517</link><description>arXiv:2509.12517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the presence and type of interaction context shapes sycophancy in LLMs. While real-world interactions allow models to mirror a user's values, preferences, and self-image, prior work often studies sycophancy in zero-shot settings devoid of context. Using two weeks of interaction context from 38 users, we evaluate two forms of sycophancy: (1) agreement sycophancy -- the tendency of models to produce overly affirmative responses, and (2) perspective sycophancy -- the extent to which models reflect a user's viewpoint. Agreement sycophancy tends to increase with the presence of user context, though model behavior varies based on the context type. User memory profiles are associated with the largest increases in agreement sycophancy (e.g. $+$45\% for Gemini 2.5 Pro), and some models become more sycophantic even with non-user synthetic contexts (e.g. $+$15\% for Llama 4 Scout). Perspective sycophancy increases only when models can accurately infer user viewpoints from interaction context. Overall, context shapes sycophancy in heterogeneous ways, underscoring the need for evaluations grounded in real-world interactions and raising questions for system design around alignment, memory, and personalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.12517v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiffVL: Diffusion-Based Visual Localization on 2D Maps via BEV-Conditioned GPS Denoising</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14565</link><description>arXiv:2509.14565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide high-precision localization references, their costly construction and maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g., OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals, achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14565v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring the Global-to-Local Attention Scheme in Graph Transformers: An Empirical Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14863</link><description>arXiv:2509.14863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14863v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emergent Alignment via Competition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15090</link><description>arXiv:2509.15090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values remains a fundamental challenge, but does our inability to create perfectly aligned models preclude obtaining the benefits of alignment? We study a strategic setting where a human user interacts with multiple differently misaligned AI agents, none of which are individually well-aligned. Our key insight is that when the users utility lies approximately within the convex hull of the agents utilities, a condition that becomes easier to satisfy as model diversity increases, strategic competition can yield outcomes comparable to interacting with a perfectly aligned model. We model this as a multi-leader Stackelberg game, extending Bayesian persuasion to multi-round conversations between differently informed parties, and prove three results: (1) when perfect alignment would allow the user to learn her Bayes-optimal action, she can also do so in all equilibria under the convex hull condition (2) under weaker assumptions requiring only approximate utility learning, a non-strategic user employing quantal response achieves near-optimal utility in all equilibria and (3) when the user selects the best single AI after an evaluation period, equilibrium guarantees remain near-optimal without further distributional assumptions. We complement the theory with two sets of experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.15090v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] L2M-Reg: Building-level Uncertainty-aware Registration of Outdoor LiDAR Point Clouds and Semantic 3D City Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16832</link><description>arXiv:2509.16832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate registration between LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds and semantic 3D city models is a fundamental topic in urban digital twinning and a prerequisite for downstream tasks, such as digital construction, change detection, and model refinement. However, achieving accurate LiDAR-to-Model registration at the individual building level remains challenging, particularly due to the generalization uncertainty in semantic 3D city models at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2). This paper addresses this gap by proposing L2M-Reg, a plane-based fine registration method that explicitly accounts for model uncertainty. L2M-Reg consists of three key steps: establishing reliable plane correspondence, building a pseudo-plane-constrained Gauss-Helmert model, and adaptively estimating vertical translation. Overall, extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that L2M-Reg is both more accurate and computationally efficient than current leading ICP-based and plane-based methods. Therefore, L2M-Reg provides a novel building-level solution regarding LiDAR-to-Model registration when model uncertainty is present.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents tackle data-intensive tasks such as deep research and code generation. However, their effectiveness depends on frequent interactions with knowledge sources across remote clouds or regions. Such interactions can create non-trivial latency and cost bottlenecks. Existing caching solutions focus on exact-match queries, limiting their effectiveness for semantic knowledge reuse.
  To address this challenge, we introduce Cortex, a novel cross-region knowledge caching architecture for LLM agents. At its core are two abstractions: Semantic Element (SE) and Semantic Retrieval Index (Seri). A semantic element captures the semantic embedding representation of an LLM query together with performance-aware metadata such as latency, cost, and staticity. Seri then provides two-stage retrieval: a vector similar index with semantic embedding for fast candidate selection and a lightweight LLM-powered semantic judger for precise validation. Atop these primitives, Cortex builds a new cache interface that includes a new semantic-aware cache hit definition, a cost-efficient eviction policy, and proactive prefetching. To reduce overhead, Cortex co-locates the small LLM judger with the main LLM using adaptive scheduling and resource sharing. Our evaluation demonstrates that Cortex delivers substantial performance improvements without compromising correctness. On representative search workloads, Cortex achieves up to a 3.6x increase in throughput by maintaining cache hit rates of over 85%, while preserving accuracy virtually identical to non-cached baselines. Cortex also improves throughput for coding tasks by 20%, showcasing its versatility across diverse agentic workloads.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.17360v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlexGuard: A Design Space for On-Body Feedback for Safety Scaffolding in Strength Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18662</link><description>arXiv:2509.18662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strength training carries inherent safety risks when exercises are performed without supervision. While haptics research has advanced, there remains a gap in how to integrate on-body feedback into intelligent wearables. Developing such a design space requires experiencing feedback in context, yet obtaining functional systems is costly. By addressing these challenges, we introduce FlexGuard, a design space for on-body feedback that scaffolds safety during strength training. The design space was derived from nine co-design workshops, where novice trainees and expert trainers DIY'd low-fidelity on-body feedback systems, tried them immediately, and surfaced needs and challenges encountered in real exercising contexts. We then evaluated the design space through speed dating, using storyboards to cover the design dimensions. We followed up with workshops to further validate selected dimensions in practice through a proof-of-concept wearable system prototype, examining how on-body feedback scaffolds safety during exercise. Our findings extend the design space for sports and fitness wearables in the context of strength training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.18662v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GeoResponder: Towards Building Geospatial LLMs for Time-Critical Disaster Response</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19354</link><description>arXiv:2509.19354v2 Announce Type: replace

Extensive evaluations across four topologically distinct cities and diverse tasks demonstrate that GeoResponder significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art foundation models and domain-specific baselines. These results suggest that LLMs can begin to internalize and generalize geospatial structures, pointing toward the future development of language models capable of supporting disaster response needs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19354v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decipher-MR: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for 3D MRI Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21249</link><description>arXiv:2509.21249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a critical imaging modality in clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity hinder scalable, generalizable machine learning.

To enable efficient use, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen pretrained encoder.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong promise for robotic task planning, particularly through automatic planning domain generation. Planning domains are brittle under imperfect logical states and perception noise; prior approaches largely treat generated planning domains as plan utilities, overlooking their potential as scalable sources of reasoning supervision and structured reward signals. At the same time, reasoning LLMs depend on chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision that is expensive to collect for robotic tasks, and reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in reward engineering. We propose Self-CriTeach, an LLM self-teaching and self-critiquing framework in which an LLM autonomously generates symbolic planning domains that serve a dual role: (i) enabling large-scale generation of robotic planning problem-plan pairs, and (ii) providing structured reward functions. First, the self-written domains enable large-scale generation of symbolic task plans, which are automatically transformed into extended CoT trajectories for supervised fine-tuning. Second, the self-written domains are reused as structured reward functions, providing dense feedback for reinforcement learning without manual reward engineering. This unified training pipeline yields a planning-enhanced LLM with higher planning success rates, stronger cross-task generalization, reduced inference cost, and improved robustness to imperfect logical states.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21543v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VLBiMan: Vision-Language Anchored One-Shot Demonstration Enables Generalizable Bimanual Robotic Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21723</link><description>arXiv:2509.21723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving generalizable bimanual manipulation requires systems that can learn efficiently from minimal human input while adapting to real-world uncertainties and diverse embodiments. Existing approaches face a dilemma: imitation policy learning demands extensive demonstrations to cover task variations, while modular methods often lack flexibility in dynamic scenes. We introduce VLBiMan, a framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through task-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while dynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This adaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes, object repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system inherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and asynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across tool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in demonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional generalization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3) robustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances, and (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from human demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without retraining. By bridging human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation, our work takes a step toward practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in unstructured settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21723v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LUMINA: Detecting Hallucinations in RAG System with Context-Knowledge Signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21875</link><description>arXiv:2509.21875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context--knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.

In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the spatial bias of LVLMs, examining how models respond when identical key visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through controlled probing experiments, we observe that current LVLMs often produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a clear spatial bias in their semantic understanding. Further analysis indicates that this bias does not stem from the vision encoder, but rather from a mismatch in attention mechanisms between the vision encoder and the large language model, which disrupts the global information flow. Motivated by this insight, we propose Adaptive Global Context Injection (AGCI), a lightweight mechanism that dynamically injects shared global visual context into each image token. AGCI works without architectural modifications, mitigating spatial bias by enhancing the semantic accessibility of image tokens while preserving the model's intrinsic capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGCI not only enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs, but also achieves strong performance on various downstream tasks and hallucination benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21984v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Capacity-Based Rationale for Multi-Head Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22840</link><description>arXiv:2509.22840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the capacity of the self-attention key-query channel: for a fixed budget, how many distinct token-token relations can a single layer reliably encode? We introduce Relational Graph Recognition, where the key-query channel encodes a directed graph and, given a context (a subset of the vertices), must recover the neighbors of each vertex in the context. We measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. In a tractable multi-head model, we prove matching information-theoretic lower bounds and upper bounds via explicit constructions showing that recovering a graph with $m'$ relations in $d_{\text{model}}$-dimensional embeddings requires $D_K$ to grow essentially as $m'/d_{\text{model}}$ up to logarithmic factors, and we obtain corresponding guarantees for scaled-softmax attention. This analysis yields a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head attention: even in permutation graphs, where all queries attend to a single target, splitting a fixed $D_K$ budget into multiple heads increases capacity by reducing interference from embedding superposition. Controlled experiments mirror the theory, revealing sharp phase transitions at the predicted capacity, and the multi-head advantage persists when adding softmax normalization, value routing, and a full Transformer block trained with frozen GPT-2 embeddings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22840v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Deferral to Learning: Online In-Context Knowledge Distillation for LLM Cascades</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22984</link><description>arXiv:2509.22984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard LLM cascades improve efficiency by deferring difficult queries from weak to strong models. However, these systems are typically static: when faced with repeated or semantically similar queries, they redundantly consult the expensive model, failing to adapt during inference. To address this, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online, interactive framework that transforms the strong model from a temporary helper into a long-term teacher. In our approach, when the strong model resolves a deferred query, it generates a generalized, reusable problem-solving strategy. These strategies are stored in a dynamic repository and retrieved via similarity matching to augment the weak model's context for future queries. This enables the weak model to learn on the job without expensive parameter fine-tuning. We theoretically show that this mechanism improves the weak model's confidence calibration. Empirically, Inter-Cascade outperforms standard cascades on multiple benchmarks, improving weak model and overall system accuracy by up to 33.06 percent and 6.35 percent, while reducing strong model calls by up to 48.05 percent and saving fee by up to 49.63 percent. Inter-Cascade demonstrates effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs and provides a general, scalable framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22984v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LAGEA: Language Guided Embodied Agents for Robotic Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23155</link><description>arXiv:2509.23155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation benefits from foundation models that describe goals, but today's agents still lack a principled way to learn from their own mistakes. We ask whether natural language can serve as feedback, an error-reasoning signal that helps embodied agents diagnose what went wrong and correct course. We introduce LAGEA (Language Guided Embodied Agents), a framework that turns episodic, schema-constrained reflections from a vision language model (VLM) into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning. LAGEA summarizes each attempt in concise language, localizes the decisive moments in the trajectory, aligns feedback with visual state in a shared representation, and converts goal progress and feedback agreement into bounded, step-wise shaping rewards whose influence is modulated by an adaptive, failure-aware coefficient. This design yields dense signals early when exploration needs direction and gracefully recedes as competence grows. On the Meta-World MT10 and Robotic Fetch embodied manipulation benchmark, LAGEA improves average success over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 9.0% on random goals, 5.3% on fixed goals, and 17% on fetch tasks, while converging faster. These results support our hypothesis: language, when structured and grounded in time, is an effective mechanism for teaching robots to self-reflect on mistakes and make better choices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.23155v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A2D: Any-Order, Any-Step Safety Alignment for Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23286</link><description>arXiv:2509.23286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x faster safe termination.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.23286v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VioPTT: Violin Technique-Aware Transcription from Synthetic Data Augmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23759</link><description>arXiv:2509.23759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While automatic music transcription is well-established in music information retrieval, most models are limited to transcribing pitch and timing information from audio, and thus omit crucial expressive and instrument-specific nuances. One example is playing technique on the violin, which affords its distinct palette of timbres for maximal emotional impact. Here, we propose VioPTT (Violin Playing Technique-aware Transcription), a lightweight cascade model that directly transcribes violin playing technique in addition to pitch onset and offset. Furthermore, we release MOSA-VPT, a novel, high-quality synthetic violin playing technique dataset to circumvent the need for manually labeled annotations. Leveraging this dataset, our model demonstrated strong generalization to real-world note-level violin technique recordings in addition to achieving state-of-the-art transcription performance. To our knowledge, VioPTT is the first to jointly combine violin transcription and playing technique prediction within a unified framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.23759v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Winning the Pruning Gamble: A Unified Approach to Joint Sample and Token Pruning for Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23873</link><description>arXiv:2509.23873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B, Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in budget-constrained LLM SFT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.23873v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Having Lunch Now": Understanding How Users Engage with a Proactive Agent for Daily Planning and Self-Reflection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24073</link><description>arXiv:2509.24073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational agents have been studied as tools to scaffold planning and self-reflection for productivity and well-being. While prior work has demonstrated positive outcomes, we still lack a clear understanding of what drives these results and how users behave and communicate with agents that act as coaches rather than assistants. Such understanding is critical for designing interactions in which agents foster meaningful behavioral change. We conducted a 14-day longitudinal study with 12 participants using a proactive agent that initiated regular check-ins to support daily planning and reflection. Our findings reveal diverse interaction patterns: participants accepted or negotiated suggestions, developed shared mental models, reported progress, and at times resisted or disengaged. We also identified problematic aspects of the agent's behavior, including rigidity, premature turn-taking, and overpromising. Our work contributes to understanding how people interact with a proactive, coach-like agent and offers design considerations for facilitating effective behavioral change.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24073v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Relayed and Switched Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Network Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24440</link><description>arXiv:2509.24440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of two architectures for network-wide quantum key distribution (QKD): Relayed QKD, which relays keys over multi-link QKD paths for non-adjacent nodes, and Switched QKD, which uses optical switches to dynamically connect arbitrary QKD modules to form direct QKD links between them. An advantage of Switched QKD is that it distributes quantum keys end-to-end, whereas Relayed relies on trusted nodes. However, Switched depends on arbitrary matching of QKD modules. We first experimentally evaluate the performance of commercial DV-QKD modules; for each of three vendors we benchmark the performance in standard/matched module pairs and in unmatched pairs to emulate configurations in the Switched QKD network architecture. The analysis reveals that in some cases a notable variation in the generated secret key rate (SKR) between the matched and unmatched pairs is observed. Driven by these experimental findings, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis that evaluates the network-wide performance of the two architectures. Our analysis is based on uniform ring networks, where we derive optimal key management configurations and analytical formulas for the achievable consumed SKR. We compare network performance under varying ring sizes, QKD link losses, QKD receivers' sensitivity and performance penalties of unmatched modules. Our findings indicate that Switched QKD performs better in dense rings (short distances, large node counts), while Relayed QKD is more effective in longer distances and large node counts. Moreover, we confirm that unmatched QKD modules penalties significantly impact the efficiency of Switched QKD architecture.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24440v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] More than MACs: Exploring the Role of Neuromorphic Engineering in the Age of LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24521</link><description>arXiv:2509.24521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The introduction of large language models has significantly expanded global demand for computing; addressing this growing demand requires novel approaches that introduce new capabilities while addressing extant needs. Although inspiration from biological systems served as the foundation on which modern artificial intelligence (AI) was developed, many modern advances have been made without clear parallels to biological computing. As a result, the ability of techniques inspired by ``natural intelligence'' (NI) to inflect modern AI systems may be questioned. However, by analyzing remaining disparities between AI and NI, we argue that further biological inspiration can contribute towards expanding the capabilities of artificial systems, enabling them to succeed in real-world environments and adapt to niche applications. To elucidate which NI mechanisms can contribute toward this goal, we review and compare elements of biological and artificial computing systems, emphasizing areas of NI that have not yet been effectively captured by AI. We then suggest areas of opportunity for NI-inspired mechanisms that can inflect AI hardware and software.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24521v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EVODiff: Entropy-aware Variance Optimized Diffusion Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26096</link><description>arXiv:2509.26096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation but suffer from slow inference and training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based solvers for DMs accelerate denoising inference, they often lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained progress in time series forecasting, particularly with the rise of pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have limited domain coverage or overlook real-world settings such as tasks with covariates. Their aggregation procedures frequently lack statistical rigor, making it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements or random variation. Many benchmarks lack consistent evaluation infrastructure or are too rigid for integration into existing pipelines. To address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark of 100 forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 with covariates. Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for forecasting evaluation emphasizing reproducibility and integration with existing workflows. Using fev, fev-bench employs principled aggregation with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report performance along two dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We report results on fev-bench for pretrained, statistical, and baseline models and identify promising future research directions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26468v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Free Draft-and-Verification: Toward Lossless Parallel Decoding for Diffusion Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00294</link><description>arXiv:2510.00294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Taking advantage of their inherent modeling foundations, DLLMs have the great potential of efficient inference with parallel decoding algorithms, which enable multi-token prediction. However, the high generation quality often requires the number of decoding steps equal to the sequence length, which performs a one-token-per-step decoding, and existing parallel decoding algorithms, which yield suboptimal decoding paths, bring inference speedup at the cost of non-negligible performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free Draft-and-Verification (FreeDave), a novel fast decoding algorithm tailored for DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding without any model modification or extra modules. Specifically, we propose an algorithm of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is theoretically guaranteed to use the fewest model forward calls to reproduce the same sequence generated by one-token-per-step decoding. By extensive evaluations on math reasoning and code generation benchmarks across different DLLMs, FreeDave is proven to accelerate the inference up to $2.83\times$ without performance degradation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.00294v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UrbanGraph: Physics-Informed Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Heterogeneous Graphs for Urban Microclimate Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00457</link><description>arXiv:2510.00457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical, as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a framework founded on a novel structure-based inductive bias. Unlike implicit graph learning, UrbanGraph transforms physical first principles into a dynamic causal topology, explicitly encoding time-varying causalities (e.g., shading and convection) directly into the graph structure to ensure physical consistency and data efficiency. Results show that UrbanGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across all baselines. Specifically, the use of explicit causal pruning significantly reduces the model's floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 73.8% and increases training speed by 21% compared to implicit graphs. Our contribution includes the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and a generalizable explicit topological encoding paradigm applicable to urban spatio-temporal dynamics governed by known physical equations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.00457v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mechanistic Interpretability as Statistical Estimation: A Variance Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00845</link><description>arXiv:2510.00845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to reverse-engineer model behaviors by identifying functional sub-networks. Yet, the scientific validity of these findings depends on their stability. In this work, we argue that circuit discovery is not a standalone task but a statistical estimation problem built upon causal mediation analysis (CMA). We uncover a fundamental instability at this base layer: exact, single-input CMA scores exhibit high intrinsic variance, implying that the causal effect of a component is a volatile random variable rather than a fixed property. We then demonstrate that circuit discovery pipelines inherit this variance and further amplify it. Fast approximation methods, such as Edge Attribution Patching and its successors, introduce additional estimation noise, while aggregating these noisy scores over datasets leads to fragile structural estimates. Consequently, small perturbations in input data or hyperparameters yield vastly different circuits. We systematically decompose these sources of variance and advocate for more rigorous MI practices, prioritizing statistical robustness and routine reporting of stability metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.00845v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What MLLMs Learn about When they Learn about Multimodal Reasoning: Perception, Reasoning, or their Integration?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01719</link><description>arXiv:2510.01719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluation of multimodal reasoning models is typically reduced to a single accuracy score, implicitly treating reasoning as a unitary capability. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark of textbook-style geometry problems that exposes this assumption by operationally decomposing performance into Perception, Reasoning, and Integration. Each problem is derived from a symbolic specification and accompanied by visual diagrams, text-only variants, multimodal questions, and targeted perceptual probes, enabling controlled measurement of each component. Using this decomposition, we show that common training strategies induce systematically different capability profiles that are invisible under aggregate accuracy. Reinforcement learning primarily improves perceptual grounding and robustness to diagram variation, while textual SFT yields gains through reflective reasoning. In contrast, as perception and reasoning improve, a growing fraction of remaining errors fall outside these components and are categorized as integration. These results suggest that apparent progress in multimodal reasoning reflects shifting balances among subskills rather than uniform advancement, motivating evaluation beyond scalar accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01719v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do AI Models Perform Human-like Abstract Reasoning Across Modalities?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02125</link><description>arXiv:2510.02125v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with the abstractions the benchmark was designed to test? Here we investigate abstraction abilities of AI models using the closely related but simpler ConceptARC benchmark. Our evaluations vary input modality (textual vs. visual), use of external Python tools, and reasoning effort. Beyond output accuracy, we evaluate the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their solutions, enabling us to assess whether models recognize the abstractions that ConceptARC was designed to elicit. We show that the best models' rules are frequently based on surface-level ``shortcuts,'' capturing intended abstractions considerably less often than humans. In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply; however, our rule-level analysis reveals that a substantial share of their rules capture the intended abstractions, even as the models struggle to apply these concepts to generate correct solutions. In short, we show that using accuracy alone to evaluate abstract reasoning can substantially overestimate AI capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in visual modalities. Our results offer a more faithful picture of AI models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02125v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Random: Automatic Inner-loop Optimization in Dataset Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04838</link><description>arXiv:2510.04838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective. To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior. AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods. Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving 63% memory cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04838v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Proactive defense against LLM Jailbreak</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05052</link><description>arXiv:2510.05052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of powerful large language models (LLMs) has necessitated robust safety alignment, yet these models remain vulnerable to evolving adversarial attacks, including multi-turn jailbreaks that iteratively search for successful queries. Current defenses, which are primarily reactive and static, often fail to handle these iterative attacks. In this paper, we introduce ProAct, a novel proactive defense framework designed to disrupt and mislead these iterative search jailbreak methods. Our core idea is to intentionally mislead these jailbreak methods into thinking that the model has been jailbroken with "spurious responses". These misleading responses provide false signals to the attacker's internal optimization loop, causing the adversarial search to terminate prematurely and effectively jailbreaking the jailbreak. By conducting extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, jailbreaking frameworks, and safety benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method consistently and significantly reduces attack success rates by up to 94% without affecting utility. When combined with other defense fraeworks, it further reduces the latest attack strategies' success rate to 0%. ProActrepresents an orthogonal defense strategy that serves as an additional guardrail to enhance LLM safety against the most effective jailbreaking attacks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05052v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vipera: Blending Visual and LLM-Driven Guidance for Systematic Auditing of Text-to-Image Generative AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05742</link><description>arXiv:2510.05742v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models (LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence, primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e., training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence) leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining 410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4 dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$ speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06048v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reusing Overtrained Language Models Saturates Scaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06548</link><description>arXiv:2510.06548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reusing pretrained base models for further pretraining, such as continual pretraining or model growth, is promising at reducing the cost of training language models from scratch. However, the effectiveness remains unclear, especially when applied to overtrained base models. In this work, we empirically study the scaling properties of model reuse and find that the scaling efficiency diminishes in a predictable manner: The scaling exponent with respect to second-stage training tokens decreases logarithmically with the number of tokens used to pretrain the base model.
  The joint dependence on first- and second-stage tokens is accurately modeled by a simple scaling law.
  Such saturation effect reveals a fundamental trade-off in multi-stage pretraining strategies: the more extensively a base model is pretrained, the less benefit additional pretraining provides.
  Our findings provide practical insights for efficient language model training and raise important considerations for the reuse of overtrained models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06548v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AWM: Accurate Weight-Matrix Fingerprint for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06738</link><description>arXiv:2510.06738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protecting the intellectual property of large language models (LLMs) is crucial, given the substantial resources required for their training. Consequently, there is an urgent need for both model owners and third parties to determine whether a suspect LLM is trained from scratch or derived from an existing base model. However, the intensive post-training processes that models typically undergo-such as supervised fine-tuning, extensive continued pretraining, reinforcement learning, multi-modal extension, pruning, and upcycling-pose significant challenges to reliable identification. In this work, we propose a training-free fingerprinting method based on weight matrices. We leverage the Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) and an unbiased Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity to neutralize the effects of parameter manipulations, yielding a highly robust and high-fidelity similarity metric. On a comprehensive testbed of 60 positive and 90 negative model pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional robustness against all six aforementioned post-training categories while exhibiting a near-zero risk of false positives. By achieving perfect scores on all classification metrics, our approach establishes a strong basis for reliable model lineage verification. Moreover, the entire computation completes within 30s on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a pragmatic phenomenon in which speakers convey meanings that diverge from literal content, relying on an interaction between semantics and prosodic expression. However, how these cues jointly contribute to the recognition of sarcasm remains poorly understood. We propose a computational framework that models sarcasm as the integration of semantic interpretation and prosodic realization. Semantic cues are derived from an LLaMA 3 model fine-tuned to capture discourse-level markers of sarcastic intent, while prosodic cues are extracted through semantically aligned utterances drawn from a database of sarcastic speech, providing prosodic exemplars of sarcastic delivery. Using a speech synthesis testbed, perceptual evaluations demonstrate that both semantic and prosodic cues independently enhance listeners' perception of sarcasm, with the strongest effects emerging when the two are combined. These findings highlight the complementary roles of semantics and prosody in pragmatic interpretation and illustrate how modeling can shed light on the mechanisms underlying sarcastic communication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07096v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causality Guided Representation Learning for Cross-Style Hate Speech Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07707</link><description>arXiv:2510.07707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony, stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations. Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches. Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders, thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues. Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in advancing generalizable hate speech detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07707v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GeoGen: A Two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Fine-grained Synthetic Location-based Social Network Trajectory Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07735</link><description>arXiv:2510.07735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07735v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OpenRubrics: Towards Scalable Synthetic Rubric Generation for Reward Modeling and LLM Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07743</link><description>arXiv:2510.07743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences. Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured criteria to capture multiple dimensions of response quality. However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further remove noisy rubrics via preserving preference-label consistency. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines by 8.4%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and biomedical benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07743v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tight Robustness Certificates and Wasserstein Distributional Attacks for Deep Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10000</link><description>arXiv:2510.10000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require prohibitive computation. We address these limitations with a primal approach and adopt a notion of exact Lipschitz certificates to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. For ReLU networks, we leverage the piecewise-affine structure on activation cells to obtain an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem. We further extend our analysis to modern architectures with smooth activations (e.g., GELU, SiLU), such as Transformers. Additionally, we propose novel Wasserstein Distributional Attacks (WDA, WDA++) that construct candidates for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing attacks that are restricted to point-wise perturbations, our methods offer greater flexibility in the number and location of attack points. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves competitive robust accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates than existing methods.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 ) and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture, the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35% and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.10706v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] video-SALMONN S: Memory-Enhanced Streaming Audio-Visual LLM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11129</link><description>arXiv:2510.11129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-duration streaming video understanding is fundamental for future AI agents, yet remains limited by ineffective long-term memory. We introduce video-SALMONN S, a memory-enhanced streaming audio-visual large language model that processes over 3-hour videos at 1 FPS and 360p resolution, outperforming strong non-streaming models under the same memory budget. In addition to token merging or downsampling, video-SALMONN S is the first to employ test-time training (TTT) as a streaming memory mechanism for video understanding. TTT continuously transforms short-term multimodal representations into long-term memory embedded in model parameters. To improve long-range dependency modeling and memory capacity, we propose (i) a TTT_MEM layer with an additional long-span prediction objective, (ii) a two-stage training scheme, and (iii) a modality-aware memory reader. We further introduce the Episodic Learning from Video Memory (ELViM) benchmark, simulating agent-like scenarios where models must learn from videos observed hours earlier. video-SALMONN S consistently outperforms both streaming and non-streaming baselines by 3-7% on long video benchmarks. Notably, video-SALMONN S achieves a 15% absolute accuracy improvement over strong non-streaming models on ELViM, demonstrating strong learning abilities from video memory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11129v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DynaSpec: Context-aware Dynamic Speculative Sampling for Large-Vocabulary Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13847</link><description>arXiv:2510.13847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by letting a small drafter propose multiple tokens which a large target model verifies once per speculation step. As vocabularies scale past 10e5 tokens,verification cost in the target model is largely unchanged, but the drafter can become bottlenecked by its O(|V|d) output projection. Recent approaches (e.g., FR-Spec, VocabTrim) mitigate this by restricting drafting to a fixed, frequency-ranked shortlist; however, such static truncation is corpus-dependent and suppresses rare or domain-specific tokens, reducing acceptance and limiting speedups. We propose DynaSpec, a context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism for large-vocabulary speculative decoding. DynaSpec trains lightweight meta-classifiers that route each context to a small set of coarse token clusters; the union of the top-selected clusters defines the drafter's shortlist, while the target model still verifies over the full vocabulary, preserving exactness. Systems-wise, routing is overlapped with draft computation via parallel execution streams, reducing end-to-end overhead. Across standard speculative decoding benchmarks, DynaSpec consistently improves mean accepted length-recovering 98.4% of full-vocabulary performance for Llama-3-8B versus 93.6% for fixed-shortlist baselines-and achieves up to a 2.23x throughput gain compared to 1.91x for static approaches on the dataset with rare tokens.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.13847v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Noise-Adaptive Layerwise Learning Rates: Accelerating Geometry-Aware Optimization for Deep Neural Network Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14009</link><description>arXiv:2510.14009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.14009v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spiking Neural Network Architecture Search: A Survey</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14235</link><description>arXiv:2510.14235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This survey paper presents a comprehensive examination of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture search (SNNaS) from a unique hardware/software co-design perspective. SNNs, inspired by biological neurons, have emerged as a promising approach to neuromorphic computing. They offer significant advantages in terms of power efficiency and real-time resource-constrained processing, making them ideal for edge computing and IoT applications. However, designing optimal SNN architectures poses significant challenges, due to their inherent complexity (e.g., with respect to training) and the interplay between hardware constraints and SNN models. We begin by providing an overview of SNNs, emphasizing their operational principles and key distinctions from traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). We then provide a brief overview of the state of the art in NAS for ANNs, highlighting the challenges of directly applying these approaches to SNNs. We then survey the state of the art in SNN-specific NAS approaches. Finally, we conclude with insights into future research directions for SNN research, emphasizing the potential of hardware/software co-design in unlocking the full capabilities of SNNs. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, offering a holistic view of SNNaS and underscoring the importance of a co-design approach to harness the true potential of neuromorphic computing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.14235v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PAINT: Parallel-in-time Neural Twins for Dynamical System Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16004</link><description>arXiv:2510.16004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems, while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. We argue, that a critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states in parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.16004v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] S4ECG: Exploring the impact of long-range interactions for arrhythmia prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17406</link><description>arXiv:2510.17406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and pathophysiological dynamics.

Our joint multi-epoch predictions significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC, with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998, demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17406v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] POPI: Personalizing LLMs via Optimized Preference Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17881</link><description>arXiv:2510.17881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned with population-level preferences, despite substantial variation across individual users. While many LLM personalization methods exist, the underlying structure of user-level personalization is often left implicit. We formalize user-level, prompt-independent personalization as a decomposition into two components: preference inference and conditioned generation. We advocate for a modular design that decouples these components; identify natural language as a generator-agnostic interface between them; and characterize generator-transferability as a key implication of modular personalization. Guided by this abstraction, we introduce POPI, a novel instantiation of modular personalization that parameterizes both preference inference and conditioned generation as shared LLMs. POPI jointly optimizes the two components under a unified preference optimization objective, using reinforcement learning as an optimization tool. Across multiple benchmarks, POPI consistently improves personalization performance while reducing context overhead. We further demonstrate that the learned natural-language preference summaries transfer effectively to frozen, off-the-shelf LLMs, including black-box APIs, providing empirical evidence of modularity and generator-transferability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17881v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simple Denoising Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22926</link><description>arXiv:2510.22926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Uniform State Diffusion Models (USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, offer the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent self-correction ability compared to masked diffusion models.

In this work, we explore a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training while matching the performance of prior methods with more complex objectives. In addition, we introduce an efficient regularization term to mitigate corruption toward uniform output distributions, which further improves performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our simple and improved loss formulations by pretraining models on widely used text datasets for USDMs. More importantly, our conclusions scale to larger models, showing strong potential for large-scale training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.22926v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transformers can do Bayesian Clustering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24318</link><description>arXiv:2510.24318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster. Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data, outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable and flexible Bayesian clustering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.24318v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Speech Synthesizers Can Learn from Multiple Teachers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24372</link><description>arXiv:2510.24372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) is inherently a "one-to-many" mapping characterized by intrinsic uncertainty, yet current paradigms often oversimplify it into a deterministic regression task. While continuous-valued autoregressive (AR) models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to discrete codec-based approaches, they typically rely on a fixed-variance prior, fundamentally constraining generation to a static point estimate that ignores the dynamic variability of natural speech. To bridge this gap, we propose BELLE (Bayesian evidential learning with language modelling), a framework that shifts from deterministic prediction to principled Bayesian inference without increasing model parameters or inference latency. By modeling the acoustic target as a Normal-Inverse-Gamma distribution, BELLE captures data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. To enable accurate variance estimation on standard single-reference datasets, we introduce a "one-to-many" training strategy that leverages synthetic samples as a statistical support set, allowing the model to learn robust distributional properties rather than merely imitating teacher artifacts. Experiments demonstrate that BELLE, trained on only ~5k hours of data, outperforms leading open-source models trained on 50k hours (achieving a 25.8% relative WER reduction) and naturally supports high-quality streaming generation.

Using data from nearly 45,000 colorectal cancer patients in the Hospital-Based Cancer Registries of S\~ao Paulo, we evaluated Random Survival Forest (RSF), Gradient Boosting for Survival Analysis (GBSA), Survival SVM (SSVM), XGBoost-Cox (XGB-Cox), XGBoost-AFT (XGB-AFT), and LightGBM (LGBM), capable of predicting survival considering censored data. Hyperparameter optimization was performed with different samplers, and model performance was assessed using the Concordance Index (C-Index), C-Index IPCW, time-dependent AUC, and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). Survival curves produced by the models were compared with predictions from classification algorithms, and predictor interpretation was conducted using SHAP and permutation importance. XGB-AFT achieved the best performance (C-Index = 0.7618; IPCW = 0.7532), followed by GBSA and RSF. The results highlight the potential and applicability of MLSA to improve survival prediction and support decision making.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.24473v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Research Roadmap for Augmenting Software Engineering Processes and Software Products with Generative AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26275</link><description>arXiv:2510.26275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE) practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence, including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering 2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for framing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these findings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26275v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chain-of-Thought Hijacking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26418</link><description>arXiv:2510.26418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve task performance through extended inference-time reasoning. While prior work suggests this should strengthen safety, we find evidence to the contrary. Long reasoning sequences can be exploited to systematically weaken them. We introduce Chain-of-Thought Hijacking, a jailbreak attack that prepends harmful instructions with extended sequences of benign puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench, CoT Hijacking achieves attack success rates of 99\%, 94\%, 100\%, and 94\% on Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGPT o4 Mini, Grok 3 Mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet. To understand this mechanism, we apply activation probing, attention analysis, and causal interventions. We find that refusal depends on a low-dimensional safety signal that becomes diluted as reasoning grows: mid-layers encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the refusal outcome. These findings demonstrate that explicit chain-of-thought reasoning introduces a systematic vulnerability when combined with answer-prompting cues. We release all evaluation materials to facilitate replication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26418v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Layer of Truth: Probing Belief Shifts under Continual Pre-Training Poisoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26829</link><description>arXiv:2510.26829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that continual pretraining on plausible misinformation can overwrite specific factual knowledge in large language models without degrading overall performance. Unlike prior poisoning work under static pretraining, we study repeated exposure to counterfactual claims during continual updates. Using paired fact-counterfact items with graded poisoning ratios, we track how internal preferences between competing facts evolve across checkpoints, layers, and model scales. Even moderate poisoning (50-100%) flips over 55% of responses from correct to counterfactual while leaving ambiguity nearly unchanged. These belief flips emerge abruptly, concentrate in late layers (e.g., Layers 29-36 in 3B models), and are partially reversible via patching (up to 56.8%). The corrupted beliefs generalize beyond poisoned prompts, selectively degrading commonsense reasoning while leaving alignment benchmarks largely intact and transferring imperfectly across languages. These results expose a failure mode of continual pre-training in which targeted misinformation replaces internal factual representations without triggering broad performance collapse, motivating representation-level monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26829v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAIL-RL: Guiding MLLMs in When and How to Think via Dual-Reward RL Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02280</link><description>arXiv:2511.02280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward, which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence, and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/BytedanceDouyinContent/SAIL-RL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.02280v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Priors in Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02570</link><description>arXiv:2511.02570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used approach to hyperparameter optimization (HPO). However, most existing HPO methods only incorporate expert knowledge during initialization, limiting practitioners' ability to influence the optimization process as new insights emerge. This limits the applicability of BO in iterative machine learning development workflows. We propose DynaBO, a BO framework that enables continuous user control of the optimization process. Over time, DynaBO leverages provided user priors by augmenting the acquisition function with decaying, prior-weighted preferences while preserving asymptotic convergence guarantees. To reinforce robustness, we introduce a data-driven safeguard that detects and can be used to reject misleading priors. We prove theoretical results on near-certain convergence, robustness to adversarial priors, and accelerated convergence when informative priors are provided. Extensive experiments across various HPO benchmarks show that DynaBO consistently outperforms our state-of-the-art competitors across all benchmarks and for all prior kinds. Our results demonstrate that DynaBO enables reliable and efficient collaborative BO, bridging automated and manually controlled model development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.02570v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DecoHD: Decomposed Hyperdimensional Classification under Extreme Memory Budgets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03911</link><description>arXiv:2511.03911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing input-output dimensionality or interface semantics. We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end, yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC, aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters, and--in hardware--delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x over a baseline HDC ASIC.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.03911v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LogHD: Robust Compression of Hyperdimensional Classifiers via Logarithmic Class-Axis Reduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03938</link><description>arXiv:2511.03938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class" design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$ bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly $2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX 4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.03938v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Implementation of transformer-based LLMs with large-scale optoelectronic neurons on a CMOS compatible platform</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04136</link><description>arXiv:2511.04136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent rapid deployment of datacenter infrastructures for performing large language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the clouds is predicted to incur an exponentially growing energy consumption in the near-term future. In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only 40 nm CMOS process node, orchestrated by an optoelectronic version of systolic array with no data skew and negligible propagation delay, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm2. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.04136v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiScoFormer: Plug-In Density and Score Estimation with Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05924</link><description>arXiv:2511.05924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating probability density and its score from samples remains a core problem in generative modeling, Bayesian inference, and kinetic theory. Existing methods are bifurcated: classical kernel density estimators (KDE) generalize across distributions but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, while modern neural score models achieve high precision but require retraining for every target distribution. We introduce DiScoFormer (Density and Score Transformer), a ``train-once, infer-anywhere" equivariant Transformer that maps i.i.d. samples to both density values and score vectors, generalizing across distributions and sample sizes. Analytically, we prove that self-attention can recover normalized KDE, establishing it as a functional generalization of kernel methods; empirically, individual attention heads learn multi-scale, kernel-like behaviors. The model converges faster and achieves higher precision than KDE for density estimation, and provides a high-fidelity plug-in score oracle for score-debiased KDE, Fisher information computation, and Fokker-Planck-type PDEs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.05924v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniADC: A Unified Framework for Anomaly Detection and Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06644</link><description>arXiv:2511.06644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel task termed unified anomaly detection and classification, which aims to simultaneously detect anomalous regions in images and identify their specific categories. Existing methods typically treat anomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting their inherent correlations and limiting information sharing, which results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a model designed to effectively perform both tasks with only a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key components: a training-free Controllable Inpainting Network and an Implicit-Normal Discriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific categories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also repaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The implicit-normal discriminator addresses the severe challenge of the imbalance between normal and anomalous pixel distributions by implicitly modeling the normal state, achieving precise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image features with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on three anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD, and WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models can describe visual content, their ability to generate executable procedures remains underexplored. CrochetBench presented in this paper evaluates this shift from describing to doing through fine-grained procedural reasoning in crochet: models must recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply decreases as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, revealing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. Our proposed CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Abstract: We study sequential price competition among $N$ sellers, each influenced by the pricing decisions of their rivals. Specifically, the demand function for each seller $i$ follows the single index model $\lambda_i(\mathbf{p}) = \mu_i(\langle \boldsymbol{\theta}_{i,0}, \mathbf{p} \rangle)$, with known increasing link $\mu_i$ and unknown parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{i,0}$, where the vector $\mathbf{p}$ denotes the vector of prices offered by all the sellers simultaneously at a given instant. Each seller observes only their own realized demand -- unobservable to competitors -- and the prices set by rivals. Our framework generalizes existing approaches that focus solely on linear demand models. We propose a novel decentralized policy, PML-GLUCB, that combines penalized MLE with an upper-confidence pricing rule, removing the need for coordinated exploration phases across sellers -- which is integral to previous linear models -- and accommodating both binary and real-valued demand observations. Relative to a dynamic benchmark policy, each seller achieves $O(N^{2}\sqrt{T}\log(T))$ regret, which essentially matches the optimal rate known in the linear setting. A significant technical contribution of our work is the development of a variant of the elliptical potential lemma -- typically applied in single-agent systems -- adapted to our competitive multi-agent environment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.10718v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Efficient Mixture-of-Experts for Remote Sensing Modality-Missing Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11460</link><description>arXiv:2511.11460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing classification often suffers from missing modalities caused by sensor failures and environmental interference, leading to severe performance degradation. In this work, we rethink missing-modality learning from a conditional computation perspective and investigate whether Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can inherently adapt to diverse modality-missing scenarios. We first conduct a systematic study of representative MoE paradigms under various missing-modality settings, revealing both their potential and limitations. Building on these insights, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-LoRAs (MaMOL), a parameter-efficient MoE framework that unifies multiple modality-missing cases within a single model. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism to decouple modality-invariant shared experts and modality-aware dynamic experts, enabling automatic expert activation conditioned on available modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that MaMOL significantly improves robustness and generalization under diverse missing-modality scenarios with minimal computational overhead. Transfer experiments on natural image datasets further validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.11460v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Moirai 2.0: When Less Is More for Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11698</link><description>arXiv:2511.11698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Moirai 2.0, a decoder-only time-series foundation model trained on a new corpus of 36M series. The model adopts quantile forecasting and multi-token prediction, improving both probabilistic accuracy and inference efficiency. On the Gift-Eval benchmark, it ranks among the top pretrained models while achieving a strong trade-off between accuracy, speed, and model size. Compared to Moirai 1.0, Moirai 2.0 replaces masked-encoder training, multi-patch inputs, and mixture-distribution outputs with a simpler decoder-only architecture, single patch, and quantile loss. Ablation studies isolate these changes -- showing that the decoder-only backbone along with recursive multi-quantile decoding contribute most to the gains. Additional experiments show that Moirai 2.0 outperforms larger models from the same family and exhibits robust domain-level results. In terms of efficiency and model size, Moirai 2.0 is twice as fast and thirty times smaller than its prior best version, Moirai 1.0-Large, while also performing better. Model performance plateaus with increasing parameter count and declines at longer horizons, motivating future work on data scaling and long-horizon modeling. We release code and evaluation details to support further research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.11698v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ENGRAM: Effective, Lightweight Memory Orchestration for Conversational Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12960</link><description>arXiv:2511.12960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deployed in user-facing applications require long-horizon consistency: the ability to remember prior interactions, respect user preferences, and ground reasoning in past events. However, contemporary memory systems often adopt complex architectures such as knowledge graphs, multi-stage retrieval pipelines, and OS-style schedulers, which introduce engineering complexity and reproducibility challenges. We present ENGRAM, a lightweight memory system that organizes conversation into three canonical memory types (episodic, semantic, and procedural) through a single router and retriever. Each user turn is converted into typed memory records with normalized schemas and embeddings and stored in a database. At query time, the system retrieves top-k dense neighbors for each type, merges results with simple set operations, and provides the most relevant evidence as context to the model. ENGRAM attains state-of-the-art results on LoCoMo, a multi-session conversational QA benchmark for long-horizon memory, and exceeds the full-context baseline by 15 points on LongMemEval while using only about 1% of the tokens. These results show that careful memory typing and straightforward dense retrieval can enable effective long-term memory management in language models without requiring complex architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.12960v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reuse, Don't Recompute: Efficient Large Reasoning Model Inference via Memory Orchestration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12987</link><description>arXiv:2511.12987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong accuracy through test-time scaling, generating longer chains of thought or sampling multiple solutions, but at steep costs in tokens and latency. We argue that memory is a core ingredient for efficient reasoning: when evidence already exists, models should think less by reusing structured memory instead of recomputing derivations. We present ENGRAM-R, an inference-time memory layer that integrates typed retrieval with compact fact card representations and explicit citation control. On the LoCoMo benchmark, ENGRAM-R reduces input tokens by 85% and reasoning tokens by 75% compared to full context while maintaining high accuracy. On a multi-hop slice of the LongMemEval benchmark, it achieves similar efficiency with substantial accuracy gains. These results show that memory is not only critical for long-horizon correctness but also a practical lever for efficient reasoning under tight compute, memory, and latency budgets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.12987v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NEZHA: A Zero-sacrifice and Hyperspeed Decoding Architecture for Generative Recommendations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18793</link><description>arXiv:2511.18793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising new paradigm for industrial recommender systems. However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.18793v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Material-informed Gaussian Splatting for 3D World Reconstruction in a Digital Twin</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20348</link><description>arXiv:2511.20348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction for Digital Twins often relies on LiDAR-based methods, which provide accurate geometry but lack the semantics and textures naturally captured by cameras. Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion approaches require complex calibration and still struggle with certain materials like glass, which are visible in images but poorly represented in point clouds. We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements. We validate our camera-only method using an internal dataset from an instrumented test vehicle, leveraging LiDAR as ground truth for reflectivity validation alongside image similarity metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.20348v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Parallel Implementation of the Pilot Assignment Problem in Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20511</link><description>arXiv:2511.20511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assignment of the pilot sequence is a critical challenge in massive MIMO systems, as sharing the same pilot sequence among multiple users causes interference, which degrades the accuracy of the channel estimation. This problem, equivalent to the NP-hard graph coloring problem, directly impacts real-time applications such as autonomous driving and industrial IoT, where minimizing channel estimation time is crucial. This paper proposes an optimized hybrid K-means clustering and Genetic Algorithm (SK-means GA) to improve the pilot assignment efficiency, achieving a 29.3% reduction in convergence time (82s vs. 116s for conventional GA). A parallel implementation (PK-means GA) is developed on an FPGA using Vivado High-Level Synthesis Tools (HLST) to further enhance the run-time performance, accelerating convergence to 3.5 milliseconds.

Abstract: In this paper, we first prove that any interior point of an open interval of the real line can be interpreted as Fr\'echet means with respect to corresponding metric distances, thus extending the result of [Dinh et al., Mathematical Intelligencer 47.2 (2025)] which was restricted to intervals on the positive reals by using the family of power means: Our generic construction relies on the concept of scales of means that we demonstrate with the scale of exponential means and the scale of radical means. Second, we interpret those Fr\'echet means geometrically as the center of mass of any two distinct points on the Euclidean line expressed in various coordinate systems: Namely, by interpreting the Euclidean line as a 1D Hessian Riemannian manifold, we introduce pairs of dual Fr\'echet/Karcher means related by convex duality in dual coordinate systems. This result yields us to consider squared Hessian metrics in arbitrary dimension: We prove that these squared Hessian metrics amount to Euclidean geometry with the Riemannian center of mass expressed in primal coordinate systems as multivariate quasi-arithmetic means coinciding with left-sided Bregman centroids.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.21173v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Going with the Speed of Sound: Pushing Neural Surrogates into Highly-turbulent Transonic Regimes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21474</link><description>arXiv:2511.21474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread use of neural surrogates in automotive aerodynamics, enabled by datasets such as DrivAerML and DrivAerNet++, has primarily focused on bluff-body flows with large wakes. Extending these methods to aerospace, particularly in the transonic regime, remains challenging due to the high level of non-linearity of compressible flows and 3D effects such as wingtip vortices. Existing aerospace datasets predominantly focus on 2D airfoils, neglecting these critical 3D phenomena. To address this gap, we present a new dataset of CFD simulations for 3D wings in the transonic regime. The dataset comprises volumetric and surface-level fields for around $30,000$ samples with unique geometry and inflow conditions. This allows computation of lift and drag coefficients, providing a foundation for data-driven aerodynamic optimization of the drag-lift Pareto front. We evaluate several state-of-the-art neural surrogates on our dataset, including Transolver and AB-UPT, focusing on their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over geometry and inflow variations. AB-UPT demonstrates strong performance for transonic flowfields and reproduces physically consistent drag-lift Pareto fronts even for unseen wing configurations. Our results demonstrate that AB-UPT can approximate drag-lift Pareto fronts for unseen geometries, highlighting its potential as an efficient and effective tool for rapid aerodynamic design exploration. To facilitate future research, we open-source our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/EmmiAI/Emmi-Wing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.21474v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Co-Evolving Agents: Learning from Failures as Hard Negatives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22254</link><description>arXiv:2511.22254v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress of large foundation models has accelerated the development of task-specialized agents across diverse domains. However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.22254v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Spectral Filtering Approach on Cellular Sheaves</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00242</link><description>arXiv:2512.00242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks equip graph structures with a cellular sheaf: a geometric structure which assigns local vector spaces (stalks) and a linear learnable restriction/transport maps to nodes and edges, yielding an edge-aware inductive bias that handles heterophily and limits oversmoothing. However, common Neural Sheaf Diffusion implementations rely on SVD-based sheaf normalization and dense per-edge restriction maps, which scale with stalk dimension, require frequent Laplacian rebuilds, and yield brittle gradients. To address these limitations, we introduce Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD), a new sheaf diffusion approach whose propagation operator is a degree-K polynomial in a normalised sheaf Laplacian, evaluated via a stable three-term recurrence on a spectrally rescaled operator. This provides an explicit K-hop receptive field in a single layer (independently of the stalk dimension), with a trainable spectral response obtained as a convex mixture of K+1 orthogonal polynomial basis responses. PolyNSD enforces stability via convex mixtures, spectral rescaling, and residual/gated paths, reaching new state-of-the-art results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks, inverting the Neural Sheaf Diffusion trend by obtaining these results with just diagonal restriction maps, decoupling performance from large stalk dimension, while reducing runtime and memory requirements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.00242v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Measuring Agents in Production</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04123</link><description>arXiv:2512.04123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based agents already operate in production across many industries, yet we lack an understanding of what technical methods make deployments successful. We present the first systematic study of Measuring Agents in Production, MAP, using first-hand data from agent developers. We conducted 20 case studies via in-depth interviews and surveyed 306 practitioners across 26 domains. We investigate why organizations build agents, how they build them, how they evaluate them, and their top development challenges. Our study finds that production agents are built using simple, controllable approaches: 68% execute at most 10 steps before human intervention, 70% rely on prompting off-the-shelf models instead of weight tuning, and 74% depend primarily on human evaluation. Reliability (consistent correct behavior over time) remains the top development challenge, which practitioners currently address through systems-level design. MAP documents the current state of production agents, providing the research community with visibility into deployment realities and under-explored research avenues.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.04123v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Natural Language Actor-Critic: Scalable Off-Policy Learning in Language Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04601</link><description>arXiv:2512.04601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents -- LLMs that dynamically interact with an environment over long horizons -- have become an increasingly important area of research, enabling automation in complex tasks involving tool-use, web browsing, and dialogue with people. In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.04601v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Capturing Classic Authorial Style in Long-Form Story Generation with GRPO Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05747</link><description>arXiv:2512.05747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating and optimising authorial style in long-form story generation remains challenging because style is often assessed with ad hoc prompting and is frequently conflated with overall writing quality. We propose a two-stage pipeline. First, we train a dedicated style-similarity judge by fine-tuning a sentence-transformer with authorship-verification supervision, and calibrate its similarity outputs into a bounded $[0,1]$ reward. Second, we use this judge as the primary reward in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune an 8B story generator for style-conditioned writing, avoiding the accept/reject supervision required by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Across four target authors (Mark Twain, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy), the GRPO-trained 8B model achieves higher style scores than open-weight baselines, with an average style score of 0.893 across authors. These results suggest that AV-calibrated reward modelling provides a practical mechanism for controllable style transfer in long-form generation under a moderate model size and training budget.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05747v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Sustainable Universal Deepfake Detection with Frequency-Domain Masking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08042</link><description>arXiv:2512.08042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal deepfake detection aims to identify AI-generated images across a broad range of generative models, including unseen ones. This requires robust generalization to new and unseen deepfakes, which emerge frequently, while minimizing computational overhead to enable large-scale deepfake screening, a critical objective in the era of Green AI. In this work, we explore frequency-domain masking as a training strategy for deepfake detectors. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on spatial features or large-scale pretrained models, our approach introduces random masking and geometric transformations, with a focus on frequency masking due to its superior generalization properties. We demonstrate that frequency masking not only enhances detection accuracy across diverse generators but also maintains performance under significant model pruning, offering a scalable and resource-conscious solution. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization on GAN- and diffusion-generated image datasets and exhibits consistent robustness under structured pruning. These results highlight the potential of frequency-based masking as a practical step toward sustainable and generalizable deepfake detection.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has made knowledge-grounded reasoning increasingly practical, yet KG-based QA systems often pay a steep price in efficiency and transparency. In typical pipelines, symbolic paths are scored by neural encoders or repeatedly re-ranked by multiple LLM calls, which inflates latency and GPU cost and makes the decision process hard to audit. We introduce PathHD, an encoder-free framework for knowledge-graph reasoning that couples hyperdimensional computing (HDC) with a single LLM call per query. Given a query, PathHD represents relation paths as block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, retrieves candidate paths using a calibrated blockwise cosine similarity with Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication that outputs the final answer together with supporting, citeable paths. The design is enabled by three technical components: (i) an order-sensitive, non-commutative binding operator for composing multi-hop paths, (ii) a robust similarity calibration that stabilizes hypervector retrieval, and (iii) an adjudication stage that preserves interpretability while avoiding per-path LLM scoring. Across WebQSP, CWQ, and GrailQA, PathHD matches or improves Hits@1 compared to strong neural baselines while using only one LLM call per query, reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\%$, and lowers GPU memory by $3-5\times$ due to encoder-free retrieval. Overall, the results suggest that carefully engineered HDC path representations can serve as an effective substrate for efficient and faithful KG-LLM reasoning, achieving a strong accuracy-efficiency-interpretability trade-off.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.09369v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Knowledge to Agency: Evaluating Expertise, Autonomy, and Integrity in Finance with CNFinBench</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09506</link><description>arXiv:2512.09506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become high-privilege agents in risk-sensitive settings, they introduce systemic threats beyond hallucination, where minor compliance errors can cause critical data leaks. However, existing benchmarks focus on rule-based QA, lacking agentic execution modeling, overlooking compliance drift in adversarial interactions, and relying on binary safety metrics that fail to capture behavioral degradation. To bridge these gaps, we present CNFinBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 29 subtasks grounded in the triad of expertise, autonomy, and integrity. It assesses domain-specific capabilities through certified regulatory corpora and professional financial tasks, reconstructs end-to-end agent workflows from requirement parsing to tool verification, and simulates multi-turn adversarial attacks that induce behavioral compliance drift. To quantify safety degradation, we introduce the Harmful Instruction Compliance Score (HICS), a multi-dimensional safety metric that integrates risk-type-specific deductions, multi-turn consistency tracking, and severity-adjusted penalty scaling based on fine-grained violation triggers. Evaluations over 22 open-/closed-source models reveal: LLMs perform well in applied tasks yet lack robust rule understanding, suffer a 15.4-point drop single modules to full execution chains, and collapse rapidly in multi-turn attacks, with average violations surging by 172.3% in Round 2.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic judges for code evaluation is becoming increasingly prevalent in academic environments. But their reliability can be compromised by students who may employ adversarial prompting strategies in order to induce misgrading and secure undeserved academic advantages. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of jailbreaking LLM-based automated code evaluators in academic context. Our contributions are: (i) We systematically adapt 20+ jailbreaking strategies for jailbreaking AI code evaluators in the academic context, defining a new class of attacks termed academic jailbreaking. (ii) We release a poisoned dataset of 25K adversarial student submissions, specifically designed for the academic code-evaluation setting, sourced from diverse real-world coursework and paired with rubrics and human-graded references, and (iii) In order to capture the multidimensional impact of academic jailbreaking, we systematically adapt and define three jailbreaking metrics (Jailbreak Success Rate, Score Inflation, and Harmfulness). (iv) We comprehensively evalulate the academic jailbreaking attacks using six LLMs. We find that these models exhibit significant vulnerability, particularly to persuasive and role-play-based attacks (up to 97% JSR). Our adversarial dataset and benchmark suite lay the groundwork for next-generation robust LLM-based evaluators in academic code assessment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10415v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cargo Sherlock: An SMT-Based Checker for Software Trust Costs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12553</link><description>arXiv:2512.12553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supply chain attacks threaten open-source software ecosystems. This paper proposes a formal framework for quantifying trust in third-party software dependencies that is both formally checkable - formalized in satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) - while at the same time incorporating human factors, like the number of downloads, authors, and other metadata that are commonly used to identify trustworthy software in practice. We use data from both software analysis tools and metadata to build a first-order relational model of software dependencies; to obtain an overall "trust cost" combining these factors, we propose a formalization based on the minimum trust problem which asks for the minimum cost of a set of assumptions which can be used to prove that the code is safe. We implement these ideas in Cargo Sherlock, targeted for Rust libraries (crates), incorporating a list of candidate assumptions motivated by quantifiable trust metrics identified in prior work. Our evaluation shows that Cargo Sherlock can be used to identify synthetically generated supply chain attacks and known incidents involving typosquatted and poorly AI-maintained crates, and that its performance scales to Rust crates with many dependencies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.12553v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An End-to-End Approach for Microgrid Probabilistic Forecasting and Robust Operation via Decision-focused Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12755</link><description>arXiv:2512.12755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) introduces significant uncertainty and intermittency into microgrid operations, posing challenges to economic and reliable scheduling. To address this, this paper proposes an end-to-end decision-focused framework that jointly optimizes probabilistic forecasting and robust operation for microgrids. A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations. The results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the end-to-end decision-focused approach for resilient and cost-efficient microgrid management under uncertainty.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.12755v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BlossomRec: Block-level Fused Sparse Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13368</link><description>arXiv:2512.13368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer structures have been widely used in sequential recommender systems (SRS). However, as user interaction histories increase, computational time and memory requirements also grow. This is mainly caused by the standard attention mechanism. Although there exist many methods employing efficient attention and SSM-based models, these approaches struggle to effectively model long sequences and may exhibit unstable performance on short sequences. To address these challenges, we design a sparse attention mechanism, BlossomRec, which models both long-term and short-term user interests through attention computation to achieve stable performance across sequences of varying lengths. Specifically, we categorize user interests in recommendation systems into long-term and short-term interests, and compute them using two distinct sparse attention patterns, with the results combined through a learnable gated output. Theoretically, it significantly reduces the number of interactions participating in attention computation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BlossomRec, when integrated with state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, achieves comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing memory usage, providing strong evidence of BlossomRec's efficiency and effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/WWW2026_BlossomRec.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.13368v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probabilistic Predictions of Process-Induced Deformation in Carbon/Epoxy Composites Using a Deep Operator Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13746</link><description>arXiv:2512.13746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix respond differently to manufacturing conditions due to mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion and matrix shrinkage during curing of thermosets. These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.13746v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Multicenter Benchmark of Multiple Instance Learning Models for Lymphoma Subtyping from HE-stained Whole Slide Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14640</link><description>arXiv:2512.14640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.14640v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CountZES: Counting via Zero-Shot Exemplar Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16415</link><description>arXiv:2512.16415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object counting in complex scenes is particularly challenging in the zero-shot (ZS) setting, where instances of unseen categories are counted using only a class name. Existing ZS counting methods that infer exemplars from text often rely on off-the-shelf open-vocabulary detectors (OVDs), which in dense scenes suffer from semantic noise, appearance variability, and frequent multi-instance proposals. Alternatively, random image-patch sampling is employed, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address these issues, we propose CountZES, an inference-only approach for object counting via ZS exemplar selection. CountZES discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines OVD detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES superior performance among ZOC methods while generalizing effectively across domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16415v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] STAMP/STPA Informed Characterization of Factors Leading to Loss of Control in AI Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17600</link><description>arXiv:2512.17600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major concern amongst AI safety practitioners is the possibility of loss of control, whereby humans lose the ability to exert control over increasingly advanced AI systems. The range of concerns is wide, spanning current day risks to future existential risks, and a range of loss of control pathways from rapid AI self-exfiltration scenarios to more gradual disempowerment scenarios. In this work we set out to firstly, provide a more structured framework for discussing and characterizing loss of control and secondly, to use this framework to assist those responsible for the safe operation of AI-containing socio-technical systems to identify causal factors leading to loss of control. We explore how these two needs can be better met by making use of a methodology developed within the safety-critical systems community known as STAMP and its associated hazard analysis technique of STPA. We select the STAMP methodology primarily because it is based around a world-view that socio-technical systems can be functionally modeled as control structures, and that safety issues arise when there is a loss of control in these structures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.17600v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DEER: A Benchmark for Evaluating Deep Research Agents on Expert Report Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17776</link><description>arXiv:2512.17776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled deep research systems that generate expert-level reports through multi-step reasoning and evidence-based synthesis. However, evaluating such reports remains challenging: report quality is multifaceted, making it difficult to determine what to assess and by what criteria; LLM-based judges may miss errors that require domain expertise to identify; and because deep research relies on retrieved evidence, report-wide claim verification is also necessary. To address these issues, we propose DEER, a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports. DEER systematizes evaluation criteria with an expert-developed taxonomy (7 dimensions, 25 subdimensions) operationalized as 101 fine-grained rubric items. We also provide task-specific Expert Evaluation Guidance to support LLM-based judging. Alongside rubric-based assessment, we propose a claim verification architecture that verifies both cited and uncited claims and quantifies evidence quality. Experiments show that while current deep research systems can produce structurally plausible reports that cite external evidence, there is room for improvement in fulfilling expert-level user requests and achieving logical completeness. Beyond simple performance comparisons, DEER makes system strengths and limitations interpretable and provides diagnostic signals for improvement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.17776v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rectification Reimagined: A Unified Mamba Model for Image Correction and Rectangling with Prompts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18718</link><description>arXiv:2512.18718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image correction and rectangling are valuable tasks in practical photography systems such as smartphones. Recent remarkable advancements in deep learning have undeniably brought about substantial performance improvements in these fields. Nevertheless, existing methods mainly rely on task-specific architectures. This significantly restricts their generalization ability and effective application across a wide range of different tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Unified Rectification Framework (UniRect), a comprehensive approach that addresses these practical tasks from a consistent distortion rectification perspective. Our approach incorporates various task-specific inverse problems into a general distortion model by simulating different types of lenses. To handle diverse distortions, UniRect adopts one task-agnostic rectification framework with a dual-component structure: a {Deformation Module}, which utilizes a novel Residual Progressive Thin-Plate Spline (RP-TPS) model to address complex geometric deformations, and a subsequent Restoration Module, which employs Residual Mamba Blocks (RMBs) to counteract the degradation caused by the deformation process and enhance the fidelity of the output image. Moreover, a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) structure is designed to circumvent heavy task competition in multi-task learning due to varying distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our models have achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with other up-to-date methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18718v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Definition of Hallucination: It's The World Model, Stupid!</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21577</link><description>arXiv:2512.21577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite numerous attempts at mitigation since the inception of language models, hallucinations remain a persistent problem even in today's frontier LLMs. Why is this? We review existing definitions of hallucination and fold them into a single, unified definition wherein prior definitions are subsumed. We argue that hallucination can be unified by defining it as simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user. For example, stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base OR producing a summary which contradicts the source. By varying the reference world model and conflict policy, our framework unifies prior definitions. We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to clarify their assumed reference "world", distinguishes true hallucinations from planning or reward errors, and provides a common language for comparison across benchmarks and discussion of mitigation strategies. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks using synthetic, fully specified reference world models to stress-test and improve world modeling components.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21577v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-attention vector output similarities reveal how machines pay attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21956</link><description>arXiv:2512.21956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, facilitating the development of advanced language-learning machines. Although its utility is widely acknowledged, the precise mechanisms of self-attention underlying its advanced learning and the quantitative characterization of this learning process remains an open research question. This study introduces a new approach for quantifying information processing within the self-attention mechanism. The analysis conducted on the BERT-12 architecture reveals that, in the final layers, the attention map focuses on sentence separator tokens, suggesting a practical approach to text segmentation based on semantic features. Based on the vector space emerging from the self-attention heads, a context similarity matrix, measuring the scalar product between two token vectors was derived, revealing distinct similarities between different token vector pairs within each head and layer. The findings demonstrated that different attention heads within an attention block focused on different linguistic characteristics, such as identifying token repetitions in a given text or recognizing a token of common appearance in the text and its surrounding context. This specialization is also reflected in the distribution of distances between token vectors with high similarity as the architecture progresses. The initial attention layers exhibit substantially long-range similarities; however, as the layers progress, a more short-range similarity develops, culminating in a preference for attention heads to create strong similarities within the same sentence. Finally, the behavior of individual heads was analyzed by examining the uniqueness of their most common tokens in their high similarity elements. Each head tends to focus on a unique token from the text and builds similarity pairs centered around it.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21956v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HALF: Hollowing Analysis Framework for Binary Programs with Kernel Module Assistance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22043</link><description>arXiv:2512.22043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary program analysis represents a fundamental pillar of modern system security. Fine-grained methodologies like dynamic taint analysis still suffer from deployment complexity and performance overhead despite significant progress. Traditional in-process analysis tools trigger severe \textbf{address-space conflicts} that inevitably disrupt the native memory layout of the target. These conflicts frequently cause layout-sensitive exploits and evasive malware to deviate from their intended execution paths or fail entirely. This paper introduces \textbf{HALF} as a novel framework that resolves this fundamental tension while ensuring both analysis fidelity and practical performance. HALF achieves high-fidelity address-space transparency by leveraging a kernel-assisted process hollowing mechanism. This design effectively eliminates the observation artifacts that characterize traditional instrumentation tools. We further mitigate the synchronization latency of decoupled execution by implementing an exception-driven strategy via a lightweight kernel monitor. Extensive evaluation of a Windows-based prototype demonstrates that HALF maintains superior performance compared to conventional in-process baselines. HALF also provides unique capabilities for deconstructing complex, stealthy threats where existing frameworks fail to maintain execution integrity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22043v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Reliable Evaluation of Adversarial Robustness for Spiking Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22522</link><description>arXiv:2512.22522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) utilize spike-based activations to mimic the brain's energy-efficient information processing. However, the binary and discontinuous nature of spike activations causes vanishing gradients, making adversarial robustness evaluation via gradient descent unreliable. While improved surrogate gradient methods have been proposed, their effectiveness under strong adversarial attacks remains unclear. We propose a more reliable framework for evaluating SNN adversarial robustness. We theoretically analyze the degree of gradient vanishing in surrogate gradients and introduce the Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG), which adaptively evolves the shape of the surrogate function according to the input distribution during attack iterations, thereby enhancing gradient accuracy while mitigating gradient vanishing. In addition, we design an adversarial attack with adaptive step size under the $L_\infty$ constraint-Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD), achieving faster and more stable convergence under imprecise gradients. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially increases attack success rates across diverse adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures and neuron models, providing a more generalized and reliable evaluation of SNN adversarial robustness. The experimental results further reveal that the robustness of current SNNs has been significantly overestimated and highlighting the need for more dependable adversarial training methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22522v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GLiSE: A Prompt-Driven and ML-Powered Tool for Automated Grey Literature Extraction in Software Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23066</link><description>arXiv:2512.23066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grey literature is essential to software engineering research as it captures practices and decisions that rarely appear in academic venues. However, collecting and assessing it at scale remains difficult because of their heterogeneous sources, formats, and APIs that impede reproducible, large-scale synthesis. To address this issue, we present GLiSE, a prompt-driven tool that turns a research topic prompt into platform-specific queries, gathers results from common software-engineering web sources (GitHub, Stack Overflow) and Google Search, and uses embedding-based semantic classifiers to filter and rank results according to their relevance. GLiSE is designed for reproducibility with all settings being configuration-based, and every generated query being accessible. In this paper, (i) we present the GLiSE tool, (ii) provide a curated dataset of software engineering grey-literature search results classified by semantic relevance to their originating search intent, and (iii) conduct an empirical study on the usability of our tool.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23066v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MSACL: Multi-Step Actor-Critic Learning with Lyapunov Certificates for Exponentially Stabilizing Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24955</link><description>arXiv:2512.24955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For safety-critical applications, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) faces numerous challenges, particularly the difficulty of establishing verifiable stability guarantees while maintaining high exploration efficiency. To address these challenges, we present Multi-Step Actor-Critic Learning with Lyapunov Certificates (MSACL), a novel approach that seamlessly integrates exponential stability with maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MERL). In contrast to existing methods that rely on complex reward engineering and single-step constraints, MSACL utilizes intuitive rewards and multi-step data for actor-critic learning. Specifically, we first introduce Exponential Stability Labels (ESLs) to categorize samples and propose a $\lambda$-weighted aggregation mechanism to learn Lyapunov certificates. Leveraging these certificates, we then develop a stability-aware advantage function to guide policy optimization, thereby ensuring rapid Lyapunov descent and robust state convergence. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, comprising four stabilization and two high-dimensional tracking tasks. Experimental results demonstrate its consistent superiority over both standard RL baselines and state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. Beyond rapid convergence, MSACL exhibits significant robustness against environmental uncertainties and remarkable generalization to unseen reference signals.

Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.
  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02754v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Driving on Registers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05083</link><description>arXiv:2601.05083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present DrivoR, a simple and efficient transformer-based architecture for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our approach builds on pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) and introduces camera-aware register tokens that compress multi-camera features into a compact scene representation, significantly reducing downstream computation without sacrificing accuracy. These tokens drive two lightweight transformer decoders that generate and then score candidate trajectories. The scoring decoder learns to mimic an oracle and predicts interpretable sub-scores representing aspects such as safety, comfort, and efficiency, enabling behavior-conditioned driving at inference. Despite its minimal design, DrivoR outperforms or matches strong contemporary baselines across NAVSIM-v1, NAVSIM-v2, and the photorealistic closed-loop HUGSIM benchmark. Our results show that a pure-transformer architecture, combined with targeted token compression, is sufficient for accurate, efficient, and adaptive end-to-end driving. Code and checkpoints will be made available via the project page.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05083v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GlimpRouter: Efficient Collaborative Inference by Glimpsing One Token of Thoughts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05110</link><description>arXiv:2601.05110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by explicitly generating multi-step chains of thought, but this capability incurs substantial inference latency and computational cost. Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the "Aha Moment" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25. These results suggest a simple yet effective mechanism for reasoning: allocating computation based on a glimpse of thought rather than full-step evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05110v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autoregressive Ranking: Bridging the Gap Between Dual and Cross Encoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05588</link><description>arXiv:2601.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated a shift toward generative approaches to retrieval and ranking, aiming to supersede classical Dual Encoders (DEs) and Cross Encoders (CEs). A prominent paradigm is pointwise Autoregressive Ranking (ARR), where an LLM generates document identifiers (docIDs) token-by-token to enable ranking via beam search. ARR offers the promise of superior expressivity compared to DEs while avoiding the prohibitive computational cost of CEs. However, a formal theoretical foundation for this expressive power has been missing. Moreover, the standard next-token prediction loss is rank-agnostic and inappropriate for finetuning an LLM for ranking tasks.
  In this paper, we first prove that the expressive capacity of ARR is strictly superior to DEs. While a DE requires an embedding dimension that grows linearly with corpus size to achieve arbitrary rankings, ARR can solve it with a constant hidden dimension. We then propose SToICaL (Simple Token-Item Calibrated Loss), a generalized rank-aware training loss for LLM finetuning. By using item-level reweighting and prefix-tree marginalization, we distribute probability mass over valid docID tokens based on their ground-truth relevance. Experiments on WordNet and ESCI datasets verify that our loss suppresses invalid docID generations and significantly improves ranking metrics beyond top-1 retrieval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05588v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AWaRe-SAC: Proactive Slice Admission Control under Weather-Induced Capacity Uncertainty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05978</link><description>arXiv:2601.05978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) links are increasingly utilized in wireless x-haul transport to meet growing service demands. However, the inherent susceptibility of mmWave links to weather-related attenuation creates uncertainty about future network capacity which can significantly affect Quality of Service (QoS). This creates a critical challenge: how to make admission control decisions for slices with QoS requirements, balancing acceptance rewards against the risk of future QoS-violation penalties due to capacity uncertainty? To address this, we develop a proactive slice admission control framework that tightly integrates: (i) a predictor that leverages historical link measurements to forecast short-term attenuation and quantify uncertainty; and (ii) an admission control algorithm that incorporates both the predictions and uncertainties to maximize rewards and minimize QoS-violation penalties. We compare our framework against baseline, state-of-the-art, and idealized oracle algorithms using real-world mmWave x-haul data and residential traffic traces. Simulations suggest that our framework can achieve revenues that are 250% larger than baseline algorithms and 75% larger than state-of-the-art algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05978v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Psychology of Learning from Machines: Anthropomorphic AI and the Paradox of Automation in Education</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06172</link><description>arXiv:2601.06172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI tutors enter classrooms at unprecedented speed, their deployment increasingly outpaces our grasp of the psychological and social consequences of such technology. Yet decades of research in automation psychology, human factors, and human-computer interaction provide crucial insights that remain underutilized in educational AI design. This work synthesizes four research traditions -- automation psychology, human factors engineering, HCI, and philosophy of technology -- to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding how learners psychologically relate to anthropomorphic AI tutors. We identify three persistent challenges intensified by Generative AI's conversational fluency. First, learners exhibit dual trust calibration failures -- automation bias (uncritical acceptance) and algorithm aversion (excessive rejection after errors) -- with an expertise paradox where novices overrely while experts underrely. Second, while anthropomorphic design enhances engagement, it can distract from learning and foster harmful emotional attachment. Third, automation ironies persist: systems meant to aid cognition introduce designer errors, degrade skills through disuse, and create monitoring burdens humans perform poorly. We ground this theoretical synthesis through comparative analysis of over 104,984 YouTube comments across AI-generated philosophical debates and human-created engineering tutorials, revealing domain-dependent trust patterns and strong anthropomorphic projection despite minimal cues. For engineering education, our synthesis mandates differentiated approaches: AI tutoring for technical foundations where automation bias is manageable through proper scaffolding, but human facilitation for design, ethics, and professional judgment where tacit knowledge transmission proves irreplaceable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06172v2</guid></item></channel></rss>
