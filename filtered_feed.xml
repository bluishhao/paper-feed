Abstract: Normative modeling estimates reference distributions of biological measures conditional on covariates, enabling centiles and clinically interpretable deviation scores to be derived. Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions, the transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than the MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines. These results support diffusion-based normative modeling as a practical route to calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Templated Assembly Theory: An Extension of the Canonical Assembly Index with Block-Compressed Template</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04889</link><description>arXiv:2602.04889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembly Theory, as developed by Cronin and co-workers, assigns to an object an assembly index: the minimal number of binary join operations required to build at least one copy of the object from a specified set of basic building blocks, allowing reuse of intermediate components. For strings over a finite alphabet, the canonical assembly index can be defined in the free semigroup with universal binary concatenation and a "no-trash" condition, and its exact computation has been shown to be NP-complete. In this paper we propose an extension of the canonical, string-based formulation which augments pure concatenation with templated assembly steps. Intermediate objects may contain a distinguished wildcard symbol that represents a compressible block. Templates are restricted to block-compressed substrings of the target string and can be instantiated by inserting previously assembled motifs into one or many wildcard positions, possibly in parallel. This yields a new complexity measure, the templated assembly index, which strictly generalises the canonical index while preserving its operational character. We formalise the model, clarify its relation to the canonical assembly index and to classical problems such as the smallest grammar problem, and discuss the computational complexity of determining the templated assembly index. Finally, we sketch potential applications in sequence analysis, modularity detection, and biosignature design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04889v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Doc2Spec: Synthesizing Formal Programming Specifications from Natural Language via Grammar Induction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04892</link><description>arXiv:2602.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that API implementations and usage comply with natural language programming rules is critical for software correctness, security, and reliability. Formal verification can provide strong guarantees but requires precise specifications, which are difficult and costly to write manually. To address this challenge, we present Doc2Spec, a multi-agent framework that uses LLMs to automatically induce a specification grammar from natural-language rules and then generates formal specifications guided by the induced grammar. The grammar captures essential domain knowledge, constrains the specification space, and enforces consistent representations, thereby improving the reliability and quality of generated specifications. Evaluated on seven benchmarks across three programming languages, Doc2Spec outperforms a baseline without grammar induction and achieves competitive results against a technique with a manually crafted grammar, demonstrating the effectiveness of automated grammar induction for formalizing natural-language rules.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04892v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Causal Perspective for Enhancing Jailbreak Attack and Defense</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04893</link><description>arXiv:2602.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering the mechanisms behind "jailbreaks" in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their safety and reliability, yet these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Existing studies predominantly analyze jailbreak prompts by probing latent representations, often overlooking the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences. In this work, we propose Causal Analyst, a framework that integrates LLMs into data-driven causal discovery to identify the direct causes of jailbreaks and leverage them for both attack and defense. We introduce a comprehensive dataset comprising 35k jailbreak attempts across seven LLMs, systematically constructed from 100 attack templates and 50 harmful queries, annotated with 37 meticulously designed human-readable prompt features. By jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning, we reconstruct causal pathways linking prompt features to jailbreak responses. Our analysis reveals that specific features, such as "Positive Character" and "Number of Task Steps", act as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks. We demonstrate the practical utility of these insights through two applications: (1) a Jailbreaking Enhancer that targets identified causal features to significantly boost attack success rates on public benchmarks, and (2) a Guardrail Advisor that utilizes the learned causal graph to extract true malicious intent from obfuscated queries. Extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons and causal structure validation, confirm the robustness of our causal analysis and its superiority over non-causal approaches. Our results suggest that analyzing jailbreak features from a causal perspective is an effective and interpretable approach for improving LLM reliability.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used for code generation, but their outputs often follow recurring templates that can induce predictable vulnerabilities. We study \emph{vulnerability persistence} in LLM-generated software and introduce \emph{Feature--Security Table (FSTab)} with two components. First, FSTab enables a black-box attack that predicts likely backend vulnerabilities from observable frontend features and knowledge of the source LLM, without access to backend code or source code. Second, FSTab provides a model-centric evaluation that quantifies how consistently a given model reproduces the same vulnerabilities across programs, semantics-preserving rephrasings, and application domains. We evaluate FSTab on state-of-the-art code LLMs, including GPT-5.2, Claude-4.5 Opus, and Gemini-3 Pro, across diverse application domains. Our results show strong cross-domain transfer: even when the target domain is excluded from training, FSTab achieves up to 94\% attack success and 93\% vulnerability coverage on Internal Tools (Claude-4.5 Opus). These findings expose an underexplored attack surface in LLM-generated software and highlight the security risks of code generation. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FSTab-024E.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04894v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privacy Amplification Persists under Unlimited Synthetic Data Release</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04895</link><description>arXiv:2602.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study privacy amplification by synthetic data release, a phenomenon in which differential privacy guarantees are improved by releasing only synthetic data rather than the private generative model itself. Recent work by Pierquin et al. (2025) established the first formal amplification guarantees for a linear generator, but they apply only in asymptotic regimes where the model dimension far exceeds the number of released synthetic records, limiting their practical relevance. In this work, we show a surprising result: under a bounded-parameter assumption, privacy amplification persists even when releasing an unbounded number of synthetic records, thereby improving upon the bounds of Pierquin et al. (2025). Our analysis provides structural insights that may guide the development of tighter privacy guarantees for more complex release mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04895v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Steering Externalities: Benign Activation Steering Unintentionally Increases Jailbreak Risk for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04896</link><description>arXiv:2602.04896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activation steering is a practical post-training model alignment technique to enhance the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs). Prior to deploying a model as a service, developers can steer a pre-trained model toward specific behavioral objectives, such as compliance or instruction adherence, without the need for retraining. This process is as simple as adding a steering vector to the model's internal representations. However, this capability unintentionally introduces critical and under-explored safety risks. We identify a phenomenon termed Steering Externalities, where steering vectors derived from entirely benign datasets-such as those enforcing strict compliance or specific output formats like JSON-inadvertently erode safety guardrails. Experiments reveal that these interventions act as a force multiplier, creating new vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and increasing attack success rates to over 80% on standard benchmarks by bypassing the initial safety alignment. Ultimately, our results expose a critical blind spot in deployment: benign activation steering systematically erodes the "safety margin," rendering models more vulnerable to black-box attacks and proving that inference-time utility improvements must be rigorously audited for unintended safety externalities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04896v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semantic-level Backdoor Attack against Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04898</link><description>arXiv:2602.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are widely adopted for their strong generative capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attacks typically rely on fixed textual triggers and single-entity backdoor targets, making them highly susceptible to enumeration-based input defenses and attention-consistency detection. In this work, we propose Semantic-level Backdoor Attack (SemBD), which implants backdoors at the representation level by defining triggers as continuous semantic regions rather than discrete textual patterns. Concretely, SemBD injects semantic backdoors by distillation-based editing of the key and value projection matrices in cross-attention layers, enabling diverse prompts with identical semantic compositions to reliably activate the backdoor attack. To further enhance stealthiness, SemBD incorporates a semantic regularization to prevent unintended activation under incomplete semantics, as well as multi-entity backdoor targets that avoid highly consistent cross-attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemBD achieves a 100% attack success rate while maintaining strong robustness against state-of-the-art input-level defenses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04898v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Phantom Transfer: Data-level Defences are Insufficient Against Data Poisoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04899</link><description>arXiv:2602.04899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data poisoning attack -- Phantom Transfer -- with the property that, even if you know precisely how the poison was placed into an otherwise benign dataset, you cannot filter it out. We achieve this by modifying subliminal learning to work in real-world contexts and demonstrate that the attack works across models, including GPT-4.1. Indeed, even fully paraphrasing every sample in the dataset using a different model does not stop the attack. We also discuss connections to steering vectors and show that one can plant password-triggered behaviours into models while still beating defences.
  This suggests that data-level defences are insufficient for stopping sophisticated data poisoning attacks. We suggest that future work should focus on model audits and white-box security methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04899v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Kubernetes Performance for GenAI Inference: From Automatic Speech Recognition to LLM Summarization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04900</link><description>arXiv:2602.04900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI), particularly inference, rapidly emerges as a dominant workload category, the Kubernetes ecosystem is proactively evolving to natively support its unique demands. This industry paper demonstrates how emerging Kubernetes-native projects can be combined to deliver the benefits of container orchestration, such as scalability and resource efficiency, to complex AI workflows. We implement and evaluate an illustrative, multi-stage use case consisting of automatic speech recognition and summarization. First, we address batch inference by using Kueue to manage jobs that transcribe audio files with Whisper models and Dynamic Accelerator Slicer (DAS) to increase parallel job execution. Second, we address a discrete online inference scenario by feeding the transcripts to a Large Language Model for summarization hosted using llm-d, a novel solution utilizing the recent developments around the Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extension (GAIE) for optimized routing of inference requests. Our findings illustrate that these complementary components (Kueue, DAS, and GAIE) form a cohesive, high-performance platform, proving Kubernetes' capability to serve as a unified foundation for demanding GenAI workloads: Kueue reduced total makespan by up to 15%; DAS shortened mean job completion time by 36%; and GAIE improved Time to First Token by 82\%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04900v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Momentum Attention: The Physics of In-Context Learning and Spectral Forensics for Mechanistic Interpretability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04902</link><description>arXiv:2602.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) program has mapped the Transformer as a precise computational graph. We extend this graph with a conservation law and time-varying AC dynamics, viewing it as a physical circuit. We introduce Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation embedding physical priors via the kinematic difference operator $p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$, implementing the symplectic shear $\hat{q}_t = q_t + \gamma p_t$ on queries and keys. We identify a fundamental Symplectic-Filter Duality: the physical shear is mathematically equivalent to a High-Pass Filter. This duality is our cornerstone contribution -- by injecting kinematic momentum, we sidestep the topological depth constraint ($L \geq 2$) for induction head formation. While standard architectures require two layers for induction from static positions, our extension grants direct access to velocity, enabling Single-Layer Induction and Spectral Forensics via Bode Plots. We formalize an Orthogonality Theorem proving that DC (semantic) and AC (mechanistic) signals segregate into orthogonal frequency bands when Low-Pass RoPE interacts with High-Pass Momentum. Validated through 5,100+ controlled experiments (documented in Supplementary Appendices A--R and 27 Jupyter notebooks), our 125M Momentum model exceeds expectations on induction-heavy tasks while tracking a 350M baseline within $\sim$2.9% validation loss. Dedicated associative recall experiments reveal a scaling law $\gamma^* = 4.17 \times N^{-0.74}$ establishing momentum-depth fungibility. We offer this framework as a complementary analytical toolkit connecting Generative AI, Hamiltonian Physics, and Signal Processing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04902v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mind the Performance Gap: Capability-Behavior Trade-offs in Feature Steering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04903</link><description>arXiv:2602.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature steering has emerged as a promising approach for controlling LLM behavior through direct manipulation of internal representations, offering advantages over prompt engineering. However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed. More broadly, our work demonstrates that mechanistic control methods face fundamental capability-behavior trade-offs that must be empirically characterized before deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04903v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DCER: Dual-Stage Compression and Energy-Based Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04904</link><description>arXiv:2602.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal fusion faces two robustness challenges: noisy inputs degrade representation quality, and missing modalities cause prediction failures. We propose DCER, a
  unified framework addressing both challenges through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction. The compression stage operates at two levels:
  within-modality frequency transforms (wavelet for audio, DCT for video) remove noise while preserving task-relevant patterns, and cross-modality bottleneck tokens
  force genuine integration rather than modality-specific shortcuts. For missing modalities, energy-based reconstruction recovers representations via gradient descent
  on a learned energy function, with the final energy providing intrinsic uncertainty quantification (\r{ho} &gt; 0.72 correlation with prediction error). Experiments on
  CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, with a U-shaped robustness pattern favoring multimodal fusion at
  both complete and high-missing conditions.

Abstract: We propose Laplacian In-context Spectral Analysis (LISA), a method for inference-time adaptation of Laplacian-based time-series models using only an observed prefix. LISA combines delay-coordinate embeddings and Laplacian spectral learning to produce diffusion-coordinate state representations, together with a frozen nonlinear decoder for one-step prediction. We introduce lightweight latent-space residual adapters based on either Gaussian-process regression or an attention-like Markov operator over context windows. Across forecasting and autoregressive rollout experiments, LISA improves over the frozen baseline and is often most beneficial under changing dynamics. This work links in-context adaptation to nonparametric spectral methods for dynamical systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physics as the Inductive Bias for Causal Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04907</link><description>arXiv:2602.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery is often a data-driven paradigm to analyze complex real-world systems. In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph. Experiments on dynamical systems with diverse causal structures show that our approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates than purely data-driven state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04907v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Temporal Pair Consistency for Variance-Reduced Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04908</link><description>arXiv:2602.04908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and rectified flow, learn time-dependent vector fields but are typically trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, leading to high estimator variance and inefficient sampling. Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04908v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Where It Matters: Geometric Anchoring for Robust Preference Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04909</link><description>arXiv:2602.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and related methods align large language models from pairwise preferences by regularizing updates against a fixed reference policy. As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04909v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reducing the Costs of Proof Synthesis on Rust Systems by Scaling Up a Seed Training Set</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04910</link><description>arXiv:2602.04910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation. However, the correctness of code generated by LLMs remains a concern. A potential remedy to this concern is to have LLMs generate formal correctness proofs along with such code. However, compared with code generation, code-proof generation requires much higher reasoning capability and has much less existing data to learn from. In this paper, we present VeruSyn, a data synthesis pipeline for Verus, a state-of-the-art verification tool for system software written in Rust. Through self-synthesis and tutorial-based synthesis, VeruSyn achieves much larger scale and Verus-feature coverage than previous data-synthesis techniques designed for Verus; VeruSyn also supplements its dataset with long-chain-of-thought (CoT) data through agent trajectory synthesis. With VeruSyn, we synthesize the largest set of Verus verified programs: 6.9 million Rust programs, each with a formal specification and a proof that it meets that specification. This dataset lets us create a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model with appealing cost-proof tradeoff compared with state-of-the-art commercial models like Claude Sonnet 4.5. It also significantly outperforms models like o4-mini and previously proposed research models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04910v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A logical re-conception of neural networks: Hamiltonian bitwise part-whole architecture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04911</link><description>arXiv:2602.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple initial working system in which relations (such as part-whole) are directly represented via an architecture with operating and learning rules fundamentally distinct from standard artificial neural network methods. Arbitrary data are straightforwardly encoded as graphs whose edges correspond to codes from a small fixed primitive set of elemental pairwise relations, such that simple relational encoding is not an add-on, but occurs intrinsically within the most basic components of the system. A novel graph-Hamiltonian operator calculates energies among these encodings, with ground states denoting simultaneous satisfaction of all relation constraints among graph vertices. The method solely uses radically low-precision arithmetic; computational cost is correspondingly low, and scales linearly with the number of edges in the data. The resulting unconventional architecture can process standard ANN examples, but also produces representations that exhibit characteristics of symbolic computation. Specifically, the method identifies simple logical relational structures in these data (part-of; next-to), building hierarchical representations that enable abductive inferential steps generating relational position-based encodings, rather than solely statistical representations. Notably, an equivalent set of ANN operations are derived, identifying a special case of embedded vector encodings that may constitute a useful approach to current work in higher-level semantic representation. The very simple current state of the implemented system invites additional tools and improvements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04911v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Atomic Information Flow: A Network Flow Model for Tool Attributions in RAG Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04912</link><description>arXiv:2602.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many tool-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack precise mechanisms for tracing final responses back to specific tool components -- a critical gap as systems scale to complex multi-agent architectures. We present \textbf{Atomic Information Flow (AIF)}, a graph-based network flow model that decomposes tool outputs and LLM calls into atoms: indivisible, self-contained units of information. By modeling LLM orchestration as a directed flow of atoms from tool and LLM nodes to a response super-sink, AIF enables granular attribution metrics for AI explainability.
  Motivated by the max-flow min-cut theorem in network flow theory, we train a lightweight Gemma3 (4B parameter) language model as a context compressor to approximate the minimum cut of tool atoms using flow signals computed offline by AIF. We note that the base Gemma3-4B model struggles to identify critical information with \textbf{54.7\%} accuracy on HotpotQA, barely outperforming lexical baselines (BM25). However, post-training on AIF signals boosts accuracy to \textbf{82.71\%} (+28.01 points) while achieving \textbf{87.52\%} (+1.85\%) context token compression -- bridging the gap with the Gemma3-27B variant, a model nearly $7\times$ larger.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04912v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A$^2$-LLM: An End-to-end Conversational Audio Avatar Large Language Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04913</link><description>arXiv:2602.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing expressive and responsive conversational digital humans is a cornerstone of next-generation human-computer interaction. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced dialogue capabilities, most current systems still rely on cascaded architectures that connect independent modules. These pipelines are often plagued by accumulated errors, high latency, and poor real-time performance. Lacking access to the underlying conversational context, these pipelines inherently prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. To facilitate training, we introduce FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset designed to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics within a QA format. By leveraging deep semantic understanding, A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04913v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SLAY: Geometry-Aware Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat-Kernel</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04915</link><description>arXiv:2602.04915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new class of linear-time attention mechanisms based on a relaxed and computationally efficient formulation of the recently introduced E-Product, often referred to as the Yat-kernel (Bouhsine, 2025). The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention. We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers. To the best of our knowledge, SLAY represents the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention reported to date, enabling scalable Transformers without the typical performance trade-offs of attention linearization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04915v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simulated Adoption: Decoupling Magnitude and Direction in LLM In-Context Conflict Resolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04918</link><description>arXiv:2602.04918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently prioritize conflicting in-context information over pre-existing parametric memory, a phenomenon often termed sycophancy or compliance. However, the mechanistic realization of this behavior remains obscure, specifically how the model resolves these knowledge conflicts through compliance, and whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream. To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the "Manifold Dilution" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by "Orthogonal Interference," where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not "unlearn" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude. These findings challenge scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and underscore the necessity of vectorial monitoring to distinguish between genuine knowledge integration and superficial in-context mimicry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04918v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gradually Compacting Large Language Models for Reasoning Like a Boiling Frog</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04919</link><description>arXiv:2602.04919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but their substantial size often demands significant computational resources. To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the "boiling frog" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PTL on a variety of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04919v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CyIN: Cyclic Informative Latent Space for Bridging Complete and Incomplete Multimodal Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04920</link><description>arXiv:2602.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, mimicking the human brain's ability to integrate various modalities has seen rapid growth. Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model. Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04920v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Imposing Boundary Conditions on Neural Operators via Learned Function Extensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04923</link><description>arXiv:2602.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their ability to handle general, highly variable boundary conditions (BCs) remains limited. Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator exhibits strong sensitivity to boundary forcings. We propose a general framework for conditioning neural operators on complex non-homogeneous BCs through function extensions. Our key idea is to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The resulting operator, coupled with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator, can learn rich dependencies on complex BCs and input domain functions at the same time. To benchmark this setting, we construct 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems, with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment BCs on diverse geometries. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming baselines by large margins, while requiring no hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate that learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex BCs in existing neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04923v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowing When to Answer: Adaptive Confidence Refinement for Reliable Audio-Visual Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04924</link><description>arXiv:2602.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formal problem formulation for \textit{Reliable} Audio-Visual Question Answering ($\mathcal{R}$-AVQA), where we prefer abstention over answering incorrectly. While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task.

Abstract: The internalization of chain-of-thought processes into hidden states has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for scaling test-time compute. However, existing activation steering methods rely on static control vectors that fail to adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks. To address this limitation, we propose STIR (Self-Distilled Tools for Internal Reasoning), a framework that reformulates reasoning enhancement as a dynamic latent trajectory control problem. STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is now standard for knowledge-intensive LLM tasks, but most systems still treat every query as fresh, repeatedly re-retrieving long passages and re-reasoning from scratch, inflating tokens, latency, and cost. We present AutoPrunedRetriever, a graph-style RAG system that persists the minimal reasoning subgraph built for earlier questions and incrementally extends it for later ones. AutoPrunedRetriever stores entities and relations in a compact, ID-indexed codebook and represents questions, facts, and answers as edge sequences, enabling retrieval and prompting over symbolic structure instead of raw text. To keep the graph compact, we apply a two-layer consolidation policy (fast ANN/KNN alias detection plus selective $k$-means once a memory threshold is reached) and prune low-value structure, while prompts retain only overlap representatives and genuinely new evidence. We instantiate two front ends: AutoPrunedRetriever-REBEL, which uses REBEL as a triplet parser, and AutoPrunedRetriever-llm, which swaps in an LLM extractor. On GraphRAG-Benchmark (Medical and Novel), both variants achieve state-of-the-art complex reasoning accuracy, improving over HippoRAG2 by roughly 9--11 points, and remain competitive on contextual summarize and generation. On our harder STEM and TV benchmarks, AutoPrunedRetriever again ranks first, while using up to two orders of magnitude fewer tokens than graph-heavy baselines, making it a practical substrate for long-running sessions, evolving corpora, and multi-agent pipelines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04926v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PriMod4AI: Lifecycle-Aware Privacy Threat Modeling for AI Systems using LLM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04927</link><description>arXiv:2602.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems introduce complex privacy risks throughout their lifecycle, especially when processing sensitive or high-dimensional data. Beyond the seven traditional privacy threat categories defined by the LINDDUN framework, AI systems are also exposed to model-centric privacy attacks such as membership inference and model inversion, which LINDDUN does not cover. To address both classical LINDDUN threats and additional AI-driven privacy attacks, PriMod4AI introduces a hybrid privacy threat modeling approach that unifies two structured knowledge sources, a LINDDUN knowledge base representing the established taxonomy, and a model-centric privacy attack knowledge base capturing threats outside LINDDUN. These knowledge bases are embedded into a vector database for semantic retrieval and combined with system level metadata derived from Data Flow Diagram. PriMod4AI uses retrieval-augmented and Data Flow specific prompt generation to guide large language models (LLMs) in identifying, explaining, and categorizing privacy threats across lifecycle stages. The framework produces justified and taxonomy-grounded threat assessments that integrate both classical and AI-driven perspectives. Evaluation on two AI systems indicates that PriMod4AI provides broad coverage of classical privacy categories while additionally identifying model-centric privacy threats. The framework produces consistent, knowledge-grounded outputs across LLMs, as reflected in agreement scores in the observed range.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04927v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Euphonium: Steering Video Flow Matching via Process Reward Gradient Guided Stochastic Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04928</link><description>arXiv:2602.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While online Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning flow matching models with human preferences, current approaches are hindered by inefficient exploration during training rollouts. Relying on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, these methods struggle to discover high-reward samples, resulting in data-inefficient and slow optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Euphonium, a novel framework that steers generation via process reward gradient guided dynamics. Our key insight is to formulate the sampling process as a theoretically principled Stochastic Differential Equation that explicitly incorporates the gradient of a Process Reward Model into the flow drift. This design enables dense, step-by-step steering toward high-reward regions, advancing beyond the unguided exploration in prior works, and theoretically encompasses existing sampling methods (e.g., Flow-GRPO, DanceGRPO) as special cases. We further derive a distillation objective that internalizes the guidance signal into the flow network, eliminating inference-time dependency on the reward model. We instantiate this framework with a Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, combining latent process rewards for efficient credit assignment with pixel-level outcome rewards for final visual fidelity. Experiments on text-to-video generation show that Euphonium achieves better alignment compared to existing methods while accelerating training convergence by 1.66x.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04928v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TurboBoA: Faster and Exact Attention-aware Quantization without Backpropagation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04929</link><description>arXiv:2602.04929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the importance of post-training quantization (PTQ) for reducing memory and computation costs. Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization.

Abstract: Future AI deployments will likely be monitored for malicious behaviour. The ability of these AIs to subvert monitors by adversarially selecting against them - attack selection - is particularly concerning. To study this, we let a red team create attack policies that attempt to insert attacks into code without being caught by a monitor in the concentrated BigCodeBench backdooring setting. We decompose attack selection into two problems: mapping attacks to a quality score and mapping quality scores to submission probabilities. We frame attack selection as a classification problem and show that safety is significantly more sensitive to FPR than TPR. We find that prompting the attacker model to reason about the monitor while being cautious with attack selection reduces safety from a baseline of 99% to 59% at 0.5% auditing budget, emphasizing that eliciting attack selection capabilities of models is vital to avoid overly optimistic safety scores in control evaluations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04930v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Depth-Wise Emergence of Prediction-Centric Geometry in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04931</link><description>arXiv:2602.04931v1 Announce Type: new

Using a unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention, we demonstrate that late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token prediction. Specifically, angular organization of the representation geometry parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that does not determine prediction. Together, these results provide a mechanistic-geometric account of the dynamics of transforming context into predictions in LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04931v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Comparing Euclidean and Hyperbolic K-Means for Generalized Category Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04932</link><description>arXiv:2602.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic representation learning has been widely used to extract implicit hierarchies within data, and recently it has found its way to the open-world classification task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04932v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Birthmark Standard: Privacy-Preserving Photo Authentication via Hardware Roots of Trust and Consortium Blockchain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04933</link><description>arXiv:2602.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI systems has collapsed the credibility landscape for photographic evidence. Modern image generation models produce photorealistic images undermining the evidentiary foundation upon which journalism and public discourse depend. Existing authentication approaches, such as the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), embed cryptographically signed metadata directly into image files but suffer from two critical failures: technical vulnerability to metadata stripping during social media reprocessing, and structural dependency on corporate-controlled verification infrastructure where commercial incentives may conflict with public interest. We present the Birthmark Standard, an authentication architecture leveraging manufacturing-unique sensor entropy from non-uniformity correction (NUC) maps and PRNU patterns to generate hardware-rooted authentication keys. During capture, cameras create anonymized authentication certificates proving sensor authenticity without exposing device identity via a key table architecture maintaining anonymity sets exceeding 1,000 devices. Authentication records are stored on a consortium blockchain operated by journalism organizations rather than commercial platforms, enabling verification that survives all metadata loss. We formally verify privacy properties using ProVerif, proving observational equivalence for Manufacturer Non-Correlation and Blockchain Observer Non-Identification under Dolev-Yao adversary assumptions. The architecture is validated through prototype implementation using Raspberry Pi 4 hardware, demonstrating the complete cryptographic pipeline. Performance analysis projects camera overhead below 100ms and verification latency below 500ms at scale of one million daily authentications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ASA: Activation Steering for Tool-Calling Domain Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04935</link><description>arXiv:2602.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For real-world deployment of general-purpose LLM agents, the core challenge is often not tool use itself, but efficient domain adaptation under rapidly evolving toolsets, APIs, and protocols. Repeated LoRA or SFT across domains incurs exponentially growing training and maintenance costs, while prompt or schema methods are brittle under distribution shift and complex interfaces. We propose \textbf{Activation Steering Adapter (ASA}), a lightweight, inference-time, training-free mechanism that reads routing signals from intermediate activations and uses an ultra-light router to produce adaptive control strengths for precise domain alignment. Across multiple model scales and domains, ASA achieves LoRA-comparable adaptation with substantially lower overhead and strong cross-model transferability, making it ideally practical for robust, scalable, and efficient multi-domain tool ecosystems with frequent interface churn dynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04935v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deterministic Retrieval at Scale: Optimal-Space LCP Indexing and 308x Energy Reduction on Modern GPUs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04936</link><description>arXiv:2602.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deterministic top-k retrieval under Longest Common Prefix (LCP) similarity for N sequences of length L. We prove a tight Omega(N) space lower bound (cell-probe model) and present a trie-based index using O(N*L) space with O(L+k) query time. We contrast this with pairwise materialization (Theta(N^2)), which hits a practical OOM wall at scale, while our indexed approach remains O(N) in memory. We then introduce Thermal-Aware Logic (TAL), which turns prefix structure into range-bounded scans. In hardware measurements, TAL reduces energy per query by 308x (0.0145 J vs 4.46 J) and cuts p95 latency by 329x (0.114 ms vs 37.5 ms) on a 20M-item range-scan benchmark, while sustaining near-peak utilization (~99%) under long runs. The result is a deterministic retrieval primitive with receipts in regimes where approximate methods are unacceptable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04936v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Linear Model Merging Unlocks Simple and Scalable Multimodal Data Mixture Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04937</link><description>arXiv:2602.04937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting the best data mixture is critical for successful Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, determining the optimal mixture weights across multiple domain-specific datasets remains a significant bottleneck due to the combinatorial search space and the high cost associated with even a single training run. This is the so-called Data Mixture Optimization (DMO) problem. On the other hand, model merging unifies domain-specific experts through parameter interpolation. This strategy is efficient, as it only requires a single training run per domain, yet oftentimes leads to suboptimal models. In this work, we take the best of both worlds, studying model merging as an efficient strategy for estimating the performance of different data mixtures. We train domain-specific multimodal experts and evaluate their weighted parameter-space combinations to estimate the efficacy of corresponding data mixtures. We conduct extensive experiments on 14 multimodal benchmarks, and empirically demonstrate that the merged proxy models exhibit a high rank correlation with models trained on actual data mixtures. This decouples the search for optimal mixtures from the resource-intensive training process, thereby providing a scalable and efficient strategy for navigating the complex landscape of mixture weights.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence attracts significant attention, especially with the introduction of large language models. Its capabilities are being exploited to solve various software engineering tasks. Thanks to their ability to understand natural language and generate natural language responses, large language models are great for processing various software documentation artifacts. At the same time, large language models excel at understanding structured languages, having the potential for working with software programs and models. We conduct a literature review on the usage of large language models for software engineering tasks related to documentation and modeling. We analyze articles from four major venues in the area, organize them per tasks they solve, and provide an overview of used prompt techniques, metrics, approaches to human-based evaluation, and major datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SynthForensics: A Multi-Generator Benchmark for Detecting Synthetic Video Deepfakes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04939</link><description>arXiv:2602.04939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landscape of synthetic media has been irrevocably altered by text-to-video (T2V) models, whose outputs are rapidly approaching indistinguishability from reality. Critically, this technology is no longer confined to large-scale labs; the proliferation of efficient, open-source generators is democratizing the ability to create high-fidelity synthetic content on consumer-grade hardware. This makes existing face-centric and manipulation-based benchmarks obsolete. To address this urgent threat, we introduce SynthForensics, to the best of our knowledge the first human-centric benchmark for detecting purely synthetic video deepfakes. The benchmark comprises 6,815 unique videos from five architecturally distinct, state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. Its construction was underpinned by a meticulous two-stage, human-in-the-loop validation to ensure high semantic and visual quality. Each video is provided in four versions (raw, lossless, light, and heavy compression) to enable real-world robustness testing. Experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art detectors are both fragile and exhibit limited generalization when evaluated on this new domain: we observe a mean performance drop of $29.19\%$ AUC, with some methods performing worse than random chance, and top models losing over 30 points under heavy compression. The paper further investigates the efficacy of training on SynthForensics as a means to mitigate these observed performance gaps, achieving robust generalization to unseen generators ($93.81\%$ AUC), though at the cost of reduced backward compatibility with traditional manipulation-based deepfakes. The complete dataset and all generation metadata, including the specific prompts and inference parameters for every video, will be made publicly available at [link anonymized for review].</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04939v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transolver-3: Scaling Up Transformer Solvers to Industrial-Scale Geometries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04940</link><description>arXiv:2602.04940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for the neural surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. However, scaling these solvers to industrial-scale geometries with over $10^8$ cells remains a fundamental challenge due to the prohibitive memory complexity of processing high-resolution meshes. We present Transolver-3, a new member of the Transolver family as a highly scalable framework designed for high-fidelity physics simulations. To bridge the gap between limited GPU capacity and the resolution requirements of complex engineering tasks, we introduce two key architectural optimizations: faster slice and deslice by exploiting matrix multiplication associative property and geometry slice tiling to partition the computation of physical states. Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Transolver-3 is capable of handling meshes with over 160 million cells, achieving impressive performance across three challenging simulation benchmarks, including aircraft and automotive design tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Set Function Approximation with Quasi-Arithmetic Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04941</link><description>arXiv:2602.04941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sets represent a fundamental abstraction across many types of data. To handle the unordered nature of set-structured data, models such as DeepSets and PointNet rely on fixed, non-learnable pooling operations (e.g., sum or max) -- a design choice that can hinder the transferability of learned embeddings and limits model expressivity. More recently, learnable aggregation functions have been proposed as more expressive alternatives. In this work, we advance this line of research by introducing the Neuralized Kolmogorov Mean (NKM) -- a novel, trainable framework for learning a generalized measure of central tendency through an invertible neural function. We further propose quasi-arithmetic neural networks (QUANNs), which incorporate the NKM as a learnable aggregation function. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that, QUANNs are universal approximators for a broad class of common set-function decompositions and, thanks to their invertible neural components, learn more structured latent representations. Empirically, QUANNs outperform state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, while learning embeddings that transfer effectively even to tasks that do not involve sets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04941v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privileged Information Distillation for Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04942</link><description>arXiv:2602.04942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce {\pi}-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that {\pi}-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on {\pi}-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04942v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Context Matters: Measuring and Diagnosing Personalization Gaps in LLM-Based Instructional Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04972</link><description>arXiv:2602.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of generative AI in education has accelerated dramatically in recent years, with Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrated into learning environments in the hope of providing personalized support that enhances learner engagement and knowledge retention. However, truly personalized support requires access to meaningful Learning Context (LC) regarding who the learner is, what they are trying to understand, and how they are engaging with the material. In this paper, we present a framework for measuring and diagnosing how the LC influences instructional strategy selection in LLM-based tutoring systems. Using psychometrically grounded synthetic learning contexts and a pedagogically grounded decision space, we compare LLM instructional decisions in context-blind and context-aware conditions and quantify their alignment with the pedagogical judgments of subject matter experts. Our results show that, while providing the LC induces systematic, measurable changes in instructional decisions that move LLM policies closer to the subject matter expert policy, substantial misalignment remains. To diagnose this misalignment, we introduce a relevance-impact analysis that reveals which learner characteristics are attended to, ignored, or spuriously influential in LLM instructional decision-making. This analysis, conducted in collaboration with subject matter experts, demonstrates that LC materially shapes LLM instructional planning but does not reliably induce pedagogically appropriate personalization. Our results enable principled evaluation of context-aware LLM systems and provide a foundation for improving personalization through learner characteristic prioritization, pedagogical model tuning, and LC engineering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04972v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic hierarchical data-driven optimization: application to plasma-surface kinetics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04975</link><description>arXiv:2602.04975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04975v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BioACE: An Automated Framework for Biomedical Answer and Citation Evaluations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04982</link><description>arXiv:2602.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for generating answers to biomedical questions, it is crucial to evaluate the quality of the generated answers and the references provided to support the facts in the generated answers. Evaluation of text generated by LLMs remains a challenge for question answering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and many other natural language processing tasks in the biomedical domain, due to the requirements of expert assessment to verify consistency with the scientific literature and complex medical terminology. In this work, we propose BioACE, an automated framework for evaluating biomedical answers and citations against the facts stated in the answers. The proposed BioACE framework considers multiple aspects, including completeness, correctness, precision, and recall, in relation to the ground-truth nuggets for answer evaluation. We developed automated approaches to evaluate each of the aforementioned aspects and performed extensive experiments to assess and analyze their correlation with human evaluations. In addition, we considered multiple existing approaches, such as natural language inference (NLI) and pre-trained language models and LLMs, to evaluate the quality of evidence provided to support the generated answers in the form of citations into biomedical literature. With the detailed experiments and analysis, we provide the best approaches for biomedical answer and citation evaluation as a part of BioACE (https://github.com/deepaknlp/BioACE) evaluation package.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04982v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parameterized Algorithms for the Drone Delivery Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04985</link><description>arXiv:2602.04985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely delivery and optimal routing remain fundamental challenges in the modern logistics industry. Building on prior work that considers single-package delivery across networks using multiple types of collaborative agents with restricted movement areas (e.g., drones or trucks), we examine the complexity of the problem under structural and operational constraints. Our focus is on minimizing total delivery time by coordinating agents that differ in speed and movement range across a graph. This problem formulation aligns with the recently proposed Drone Delivery Problem with respect to delivery time (DDT), introduced by Erlebach et al. [ISAAC 2022].
  We first resolve an open question posed by Erlebach et al. [ISAAC 2022] by showing that even when the delivery network is a path graph, DDT admits no polynomial-time approximation within any polynomially encodable factor $a(n)$, unless P=NP. Additionally, we identify the intersection graph of the agents, where nodes represent agents and edges indicate an overlap of the movement areas of two agents, as an important structural concept. For path graphs, we show that DDT becomes tractable when parameterized by the treewidth $w$ of the intersection graph, and we present an exact FPT algorithm with running time $f(w)\cdot\text{poly}(n,k)$, for some computable function $f$. For general graphs, we give an FPT algorithm with running time $f(\Delta,w)\cdot\text{poly}(n,k)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the intersection graph. In the special case where the intersection graph is a tree, we provide a simple polynomial-time algorithm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04985v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Artificial Intelligence as Strange Intelligence: Against Linear Models of Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04986</link><description>arXiv:2602.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A uniformly accurate multiscale time integrator for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in the nonrelativistic regime via simplified transmission conditions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04988</link><description>arXiv:2602.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new and simplified multiscale time integrator Fourier pseudospectral (MTI-FP) method for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter epsilon in (0,1] inversely proportional to the speed of light, and establish its uniform first-order accuracy in time in the nonrelativistic regime, i.e. 0 &lt; epsilon &lt;&lt; 1. In this regime, the solution of the NKGE is highly oscillatory in time with O(epsilon^2)-wavelength, which brings significant difficulties in designing uniformly accurate numerical methods. The MTI-FP is based on (i) a multiscale decomposition by frequency of the NKGE in each time interval with simplified transmission conditions, and (ii) an exponential wave integrator for temporal discretization and a Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial discretization. By adapting the energy method and the mathematical induction, we obtain two error bounds in H1-norm at O(h^{m0}+tau^2/epsilon^2) and O(h^{m0}+tau+epsilon^2) with mesh size h, time step tau and m0 an integer dependent on the regularity of the solution, which immediately implies a uniformly accurate error bound O(h^{m0}+tau) with respect to epsilon in (0,1]. In addition, by adopting a linear interpolation of the micro variables with the multiscale decomposition in each time interval, we obtain a uniformly accurate numerical solution for any time t larger than zero. Thus the proposed MTI-FP method has a super resolution property in time in terms of the Shannon sampling theory, i.e. accurate numerical solutions can be obtained even when the time step is much bigger than the O(epsilon^2)-wavelength. Extensive numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds and demonstrate their super resolution in time. Finally the proposed MTI-FP method is applied to study numerically convergence rates of the NKGE to its different limiting models in the nonrelativistic regime.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04988v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Near-Optimal Dynamic Matching via Coarsening with Application to Heart Transplantation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04989</link><description>arXiv:2602.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online matching has been a mainstay in domains such as Internet advertising and organ allocation, but practical algorithms often lack strong theoretical guarantees. We take an important step toward addressing this by developing new online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach. Although coarsening typically implies a loss of granularity, we show that, to the contrary, aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters can yield near-optimal theoretical guarantees. We apply our methodology to heart transplant allocation to develop theoretically grounded policies based on structural properties of historical data. In realistic simulations, our policy closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical lower bounds, and provides rigorous justification for prior clustering-based approaches in organ allocation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04989v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Position: Machine Learning for Heart Transplant Allocation Policy Optimization Should Account for Incentives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04990</link><description>arXiv:2602.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The allocation of scarce donor organs constitutes one of the most consequential algorithmic challenges in healthcare. While the field is rapidly transitioning from rigid, rule-based systems to machine learning and data-driven optimization, we argue that current approaches often overlook a fundamental barrier: incentives. In this position paper, we highlight that organ allocation is not merely a static optimization problem, but rather a complex game involving transplant centers, clinicians, and regulators. Focusing on US adult heart transplant allocation, we identify critical incentive misalignments across the decision-making pipeline, and present data showing that they are having adverse consequences today. Our main position is that the next generation of allocation policies should be incentive aware. We outline a research agenda for the machine learning community, calling for the integration of mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness in the face of strategic behavior from the various constituent groups.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04990v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CVA6-CFI: A First Glance at RISC-V Control-Flow Integrity Extensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04991</link><description>arXiv:2602.04991v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Urban searches demand rapid, defensible decisions and sustained physical effort under high cognitive and situational load. Incident commanders must plan, coordinate, and document time-critical operations, while field searchers execute evolving tasks in uncertain environments. With recent advances in technology, ground-robot fleets paired with computer-vision-based situational awareness and LLM-powered interfaces offer the potential to ease these operational burdens. However, no dedicated studies have examined how public safety professionals perceive such technologies or envision their integration into existing practices, risking building technically sophisticated yet impractical solutions. To address this gap, we conducted focus-group sessions with eight police officers across five local departments in Virginia. Our findings show that ground robots could reduce professionals' reliance on paper references, mental calculations, and ad-hoc coordination, alleviating cognitive and physical strain in four key challenge areas: (1) partitioning the workforce across multiple search hypotheses, (2) retaining group awareness and situational awareness, (3) building route planning that fits the lost-person profile, and (4) managing cognitive and physical fatigue under uncertainty. We further identify four design opportunities and requirements for future ground-robot fleet integration in public-safety operations: (1) scalable multi-robot planning and control interfaces, (2) agency-specific route optimization, (3) real-time replanning informed by debrief updates, and (4) vision-assisted cueing that preserves operational trust while reducing cognitive workload.

Abstract: With the deep integration of facial recognition into online banking, identity verification, and other networked services, achieving effective decoupling of identity information from visual representations during image storage and transmission has become a critical challenge for privacy protection. To address this issue, we propose SIDeR, a Semantic decoupling-driven framework for unrestricted face privacy protection. SIDeR decomposes a facial image into a machine-recognizable identity feature vector and a visually perceptible semantic appearance component. By leveraging semantic-guided recomposition in the latent space of a diffusion model, it generates visually anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining machine-level identity consistency. The framework incorporates momentum-driven unrestricted perturbation optimization and a semantic-visual balancing factor to synthesize multiple visually diverse, highly natural adversarial samples. Furthermore, for authorized access, the protected image can be restored to its original form when the correct password is provided. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that SIDeR achieves a 99% attack success rate in black-box scenarios and outperforms baseline methods by 41.28% in PSNR-based restoration quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04994v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Rate Matters: Vanilla LoRA May Suffice for LLM Fine-tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04998</link><description>arXiv:2602.04998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the prevailing approach for efficient large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. Building on this paradigm, recent studies have proposed alternative initialization strategies and architectural modifications, reporting substantial improvements over vanilla LoRA. However, these gains are often demonstrated under fixed or narrowly tuned hyperparameter settings, despite the known sensitivity of neural networks to training configurations. In this work, we systematically re-evaluate four representative LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA through extensive hyperparameter searches. Across mathematical and code generation tasks on diverse model scales, we find that different LoRA methods favor distinct learning rate ranges. Crucially, once learning rates are properly tuned, all methods achieve similar peak performance (within 1-2%), with only subtle rank-dependent behaviors. These results suggest that vanilla LoRA remains a competitive baseline and that improvements reported under single training configuration may not reflect consistent methodological advantages. Finally, a second-order analysis attributes the differing optimal learning rate ranges to variations in the largest Hessian eigenvalue, aligning with classical learning theories.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04998v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EntRGi: Entropy Aware Reward Guidance for Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05000</link><description>arXiv:2602.05000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward guidance has been applied to great success in the test-time adaptation of continuous diffusion models; it updates each denoising step using the gradients from a downstream reward model. We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05000v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] System-Level Isolation for Mixed-Criticality RISC-V SoCs: A "World" Reality Check</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05002</link><description>arXiv:2602.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As RISC-V adoption accelerates, domains such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT), and industrial control are attracting growing attention. These domains are subject to stringent Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) constraints, which have driven a shift toward heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) integrating general-purpose CPUs, tightly coupled accelerators, and diverse I/O devices with different integrity levels. While such integration improves cost efficiency and performance, it introduces a fundamental safety and security challenge: enforcing system-level isolation in mixed-criticality environments. Although RISC-V International has proposed several hardware isolation primitives, including RISC-V Worlds, IOPMP, and SmMTT, their interoperability, scalability, and suitability for real-time systems remain insufficiently understood. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of these primitives from the perspective of practical heterogeneous SoC designs. We implement an IOPMP, a World-based checker, and a modified RISC-V World checker that addresses key limitations of the baseline specification, and evaluate their trade-offs in terms of security guarantees and power-performance-area (PPA). Our results show that the World-based checker introduces a fixed, configuration-independent access latency, achieving lower worst-case delay than the evaluated alternatives while scaling predictably with system size. At the macro level, we estimate that the proposed modifications reduce SoC area by up to approximately 5% compared to a baseline design. All artifacts will be released as open source, and we expect these findings to directly contribute to the evolution and ratification of RISC-V specifications, as well as to the design of future RISC-V SoCs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05002v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoWork-X: Experience-Optimized Co-Evolution for Multi-Agent Collaboration System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05004</link><description>arXiv:2602.05004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are enabling language-conditioned agents in interactive environments, but highly cooperative tasks often impose two simultaneous constraints: sub-second real-time coordination and sustained multi-episode adaptation under a strict online token budget. Existing approaches either rely on frequent in-episode reasoning that induces latency and timing jitter, or deliver post-episode improvements through unstructured text that is difficult to compile into reliable low-cost execution. We propose CoWork-X, an active co-evolution framework that casts peer collaboration as a closed-loop optimization problem across episodes, inspired by fast--slow memory separation. CoWork-X instantiates a Skill-Agent that executes via HTN (hierarchical task network)-based skill retrieval from a structured, interpretable, and compositional skill library, and a post-episode Co-Optimizer that performs patch-style skill consolidation with explicit budget constraints and drift regularization. Experiments in challenging Overcooked-AI-like realtime collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CoWork-X achieves stable, cumulative performance gains while steadily reducing online latency and token usage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05004v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Acoustic scattering by fractal inhomogeneities via geometry-conforming Galerkin methods for the Lippmann-Schwinger equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05005</link><description>arXiv:2602.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a numerical method for time-harmonic acoustic scattering in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n=2,3$, by a class of inhomogeneities (penetrable scatterers) with fractal boundary. Our method is based on a Galerkin discretisation of the Lippmann-Schwinger volume integral equation, using a discontinuous piecewise-polynomial approximation space on a geometry-conforming mesh comprising elements which themselves have fractal boundary. We first provide a semi-discrete well-posedness and error analysis for both the $h$- and $p$-versions of our method for completely arbitrary inhomogeneities (without any regularity assumption on the boundary of the inhomogeneity or of the mesh elements). We prove convergence estimates for the integral equation solution and superconvergence estimates for linear functionals such as scattered field and far-field pattern evaluations, and elucidate how the regularity of the inhomogeneity boundary and the regularity of the refractive index affect the rates of convergence predicted. We then specialise to the case where the inhomogeneity is an ``$n$-attractor'', i.e.\ the fractal attractor of an iterated function system satisfying the open set condition with non-empty interior, showing how in this case the self-similarity of the inhomogeneity can be used to generate geometry-conforming meshes. For the $h$-version with piecewise constant approximation we also present singular quadrature rules, supported by a fully discrete error analysis, permitting practical implementation of our method. We present numerical results for two-dimensional examples, which validate our theoretical results and show that our method is significantly more accurate than a comparable method involving replacement of the fractal inhomogeneity by a smoother prefractal approximation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05005v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhanced QKNorm normalization for neural transformers with the Lp norm</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05006</link><description>arXiv:2602.05006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The normalization of query and key vectors is an essential part of the Transformer architecture. It ensures that learning is stable regardless of the scale of these vectors.

Abstract: In the real world, robots frequently make errors, yet little is known about people's social responses to errors outside of lab settings. Prior work has shown that social signals are reliable and useful for error management in constrained interactions, but it is unclear if this holds in the real world - especially with a non-social robot in repeated and group interactions with successive or propagated errors. To explore this, we built a coffee robot and conducted a public field deployment ($N = 49$). We found that participants consistently expressed varied social signals in response to errors and other stimuli, particularly during group interactions. Our findings suggest that social signals in the wild are rich (with participants volunteering information about the interaction), but "noisy." We discuss lessons, benefits, and challenges for using social signals in real-world HRI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Private PoEtry: Private In-Context Learning via Product of Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05012</link><description>arXiv:2602.05012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with only a small set of examples at inference time, thereby avoiding task-specific fine-tuning. However, in-context examples may contain privacy-sensitive information that should not be revealed through model outputs. Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness, including context oversampling, synthetic data generation, or unnecessary thresholding. We reformulate private ICL through the lens of a Product-of-Experts model. This gives a theoretically grounded framework, and the algorithm can be trivially parallelized. We evaluate our method across five datasets in text classification, math, and vision-language. We find that our method improves accuracy by more than 30 percentage points on average compared to prior DP-ICL methods, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05012v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Untwisting RoPE: Frequency Control for Shared Attention in DiTs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05013</link><description>arXiv:2602.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positional encodings are essential to transformer-based generative models, yet their behavior in multimodal and attention-sharing settings is not fully understood. In this work, we present a principled analysis of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), showing that RoPE naturally decomposes into frequency components with distinct positional sensitivities. We demonstrate that this frequency structure explains why shared-attention mechanisms, where a target image is generated while attending to tokens from a reference image, can lead to reference copying, in which the model reproduces content from the reference instead of extracting only its stylistic cues. Our analysis reveals that the high-frequency components of RoPE dominate the attention computation, forcing queries to attend mainly to spatially aligned reference tokens and thereby inducing this unintended copying behavior. Building on these insights, we introduce a method for selectively modulating RoPE frequency bands so that attention reflects semantic similarity rather than strict positional alignment. Applied to modern transformer-based diffusion architectures, where all tokens share attention, this modulation restores stable and meaningful shared attention. As a result, it enables effective control over the degree of style transfer versus content copying, yielding a proper style-aligned generation process in which stylistic attributes are transferred without duplicating reference content.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05013v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepRead: Document Structure-Aware Reasoning to Enhance Agentic Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05014</link><description>arXiv:2602.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is evolving from one-shot, passive retrieval into multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Fragmentation to Integration: Exploring the Design Space of AI Agents for Human-as-the-Unit Privacy Management</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05016</link><description>arXiv:2602.05016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing one's digital footprint is overwhelming, as it spans multiple platforms and involves countless context-dependent decisions. Recent advances in agentic AI offer ways forward by enabling holistic, contextual privacy-enhancing solutions. Building on this potential, we adopted a ''human-as-the-unit'' perspective and investigated users' cross-context privacy challenges through 12 semi-structured interviews. Results reveal that people rely on ad hoc manual strategies while lacking comprehensive privacy controls, highlighting nine privacy-management challenges across applications, temporal contexts, and relationships. To explore solutions, we generated nine AI agent concepts and evaluated them via a speed-dating survey with 116 US participants. The three highest-ranked concepts were all post-sharing management tools with half or full agent autonomy, with users expressing greater trust in AI accuracy than in their own efforts. Our findings highlight a promising design space where users see AI agents bridging the fragments in privacy management, particularly through automated, comprehensive post-sharing remediation of users' digital footprints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05016v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A novel scalable high performance diffusion solver for multiscale cell simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05017</link><description>arXiv:2602.05017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based cellular models simulate tissue evolution by capturing the behavior of individual cells, their interactions with neighboring cells, and their responses to the surrounding microenvironment. An important challenge in the field is scaling cellular resolution models to real-scale tumor simulations, which is critical for the development of digital twin models of diseases and requires the use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) since every time step involves trillions of operations. We hereby present a scalable HPC solution for the molecular diffusion modeling using an efficient implementation of state-of-the-art Finite Volume Method (FVM) frameworks. The paper systematically evaluates a novel scalable Biological Finite Volume Method (BioFVM) library and presents an extensive performance analysis of the available solutions. Results shows that our HPC proposal reach almost 200x speedup and up to 36% reduction in memory usage over the current state-of-the-art solutions, paving the way to efficiently compute the next generation of biological problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05017v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] COFFEE: A Carbon-Modeling and Optimization Framework for HZO-based FeFET eNVMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05018</link><description>arXiv:2602.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information and communication technologies account for a growing portion of global environmental impacts. While emerging technologies, such as emerging non-volatile memories (eNVM), offer a promising solution to energy efficient computing, their end-to-end footprint is not well understood. Understanding the environmental impact of hardware systems over their life cycle is the first step to realizing sustainable computing. This work conducts a detailed study of one example eNVM device: hafnium-zirconium-oxide (HZO)-based ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs). We present COFFEE, the first carbon modeling framework for HZO-based FeFET eNVMs across life cycle, from hardware manufacturing (embodied carbon) to use (operational carbon). COFFEE builds on data gathered from a real semiconductor fab and device fabrication recipes to estimate embodied carbon, and architecture level eNVM design space exploration tools to quantify use-phase performance and energy. Our evaluation shows that, at 2 MB capacity, the embodied carbon per unit area overhead of HZO-FeFETs can be up to 11% higher than the CMOS baseline, while the embodied carbon per MB remains consistently about 4.3x lower than SRAM across different memory capacity. A further case study applies COFFEE to an edge ML accelerator, showing that replacing the SRAM-based weight buffer with HZO-based FeFET eNVMs reduces embodied carbon by 42.3% and operational carbon by up to 70%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Simple Reduction Scheme for Constrained Contextual Bandits with Adversarial Contexts via Regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05019</link><description>arXiv:2602.05019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study constrained contextual bandits (CCB) with adversarially chosen contexts, where each action yields a random reward and incurs a random cost. We adopt the standard realizability assumption: conditioned on the observed context, rewards and costs are drawn independently from fixed distributions whose expectations belong to known function classes. We consider the continuing setting, in which the algorithm operates over the entire horizon even after the budget is exhausted. In this setting, the objective is to simultaneously control regret and cumulative constraint violation. Building on the seminal SquareCB framework of Foster et al. (2018), we propose a simple and modular algorithmic scheme that leverages online regression oracles to reduce the constrained problem to a standard unconstrained contextual bandit problem with adaptively defined surrogate reward functions. In contrast to most prior work on CCB, which focuses on stochastic contexts, our reduction yields improved guarantees for the more general adversarial context setting, together with a compact and transparent analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Vision-Language Models Respect Contextual Integrity in Location Disclosure?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05023</link><description>arXiv:2602.05023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in image geolocation, a capability further sharpened by frontier multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs). This poses a significant privacy risk, as these widely accessible models can be exploited to infer sensitive locations from casually shared photos, often at street-level precision, potentially surpassing the level of detail the sharer consented or intended to disclose. While recent work has proposed applying a blanket restriction on geolocation disclosure to combat this risk, these measures fail to distinguish valid geolocation uses from malicious behavior. Instead, VLMs should maintain contextual integrity by reasoning about elements within an image to determine the appropriate level of information disclosure, balancing privacy and utility. To evaluate how well models respect contextual integrity, we introduce VLM-GEOPRIVACY, a benchmark that challenges VLMs to interpret latent social norms and contextual cues in real-world images and determine the appropriate level of location disclosure. Our evaluation of 14 leading VLMs shows that, despite their ability to precisely geolocate images, the models are poorly aligned with human privacy expectations. They often over-disclose in sensitive contexts and are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks. Our results call for new design principles in multimodal systems to incorporate context-conditioned privacy reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05023v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Laws of Learning Dynamics and the Core of Learners</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05026</link><description>arXiv:2602.05026v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are powerful tools for interpreting neural representations, yet their use in audio remains underexplored. We train SAEs across all encoder layers of Whisper and HuBERT, provide an extensive evaluation of their stability, interpretability, and show their practical utility. Over 50% of the features remain consistent across random seeds, and reconstruction quality is preserved. SAE features capture general acoustic and semantic information as well as specific events, including environmental noises and paralinguistic sounds (e.g. laughter, whispering) and disentangle them effectively, requiring removal of only 19-27% of features to erase a concept. Feature steering reduces Whisper's false speech detections by 70% with negligible WER increase, demonstrating real-world applicability. Finally, we find SAE features correlated with human EEG activity during speech perception, indicating alignment with human neural processing.

Abstract: Operating effectively in novel real-world environments requires robotic systems to estimate and interact with previously unseen objects. Current state-of-the-art models address this challenge by using large amounts of training data and test-time samples to build black-box scene representations. In this work, we introduce a differentiable neuro-graphics model that combines neural foundation models with physics-based differentiable rendering to perform zero-shot scene reconstruction and robot grasping without relying on any additional 3D data or test-time samples. Our model solves a series of constrained optimization problems to estimate physically consistent scene parameters, such as meshes, lighting conditions, material properties, and 6D poses of previously unseen objects from a single RGBD image and bounding boxes. We evaluated our approach on standard model-free few-shot benchmarks and demonstrated that it outperforms existing algorithms for model-free few-shot pose estimation. Furthermore, we validated the accuracy of our scene reconstructions by applying our algorithm to a zero-shot grasping task. By enabling zero-shot, physically-consistent scene reconstruction and grasping without reliance on extensive datasets or test-time sampling, our approach offers a pathway towards more data efficient, interpretable and generalizable robot autonomy in novel environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05029v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Laplacian Representations for Decision-Time Planning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05031</link><description>arXiv:2602.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning with a learned model remains a key challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05031v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Representation Meets Stochastic Modeling under Generic Geometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05033</link><description>arXiv:2602.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05033v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Capacity Constraints and the Multilingual Penalty for Lexical Disambiguation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05035</link><description>arXiv:2602.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual language models (LMs) sometimes under-perform their monolingual counterparts, possibly due to capacity limitations. We quantify this ``multilingual penalty'' for lexical disambiguation--a task requiring precise semantic representations and contextualization mechanisms--using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in both English and Spanish. Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families, we find consistently reduced performance in multilingual LMs. We then explore three potential capacity constraints: representational (reduced embedding isotropy), attentional (reduced attention to disambiguating cues), and vocabulary-related (increased multi-token segmentation). Multilingual LMs show some evidence of all three limitations; moreover, these factors statistically account for the variance formerly attributed to a model's multilingual status. These findings suggest both that multilingual LMs do suffer from multiple capacity constraints, and that these constraints correlate with reduced disambiguation performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05035v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feedback Control for Multi-Objective Graph Self-Supervision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05036</link><description>arXiv:2602.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can multi-task self-supervised learning on graphs be coordinated without the usual tug-of-war between objectives? Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05036v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MINT: Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree for Objective-Driven Knowledge-Gap Reasoning and Active Elicitation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05048</link><description>arXiv:2602.05048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VISTA: Enhancing Visual Conditioning via Track-Following Preference Optimization in Vision-Language-Action Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05049</link><description>arXiv:2602.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. Despite the success, extending large pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to the action space can induce vision-action misalignment, where action predictions exhibit weak dependence on the current visual state, leading to unreliable action outputs. In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models. Our approach first aligns action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and then transfers the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning. Without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection, our method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and further yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn the optimal policy from a fixed dataset generated by behavior policies without additional environment interactions. One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05051v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantile-Physics Hybrid Framework for Safe-Speed Recommendation under Diverse Weather Conditions Leveraging Connected Vehicle and Road Weather Information Systems Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05053</link><description>arXiv:2602.05053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inclement weather conditions can significantly impact driver visibility and tire-road surface friction, requiring adjusted safe driving speeds to reduce crash risk. This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05053v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VEXA: Evidence-Grounded and Persona-Adaptive Explanations for Scam Risk Sensemaking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05056</link><description>arXiv:2602.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online scams across email, short message services, and social media increasingly challenge everyday risk assessment, particularly as generative AI enables more fluent and context-aware deception. Although transformer-based detectors achieve strong predictive performance, their explanations are often opaque to non-experts or misaligned with model decisions. We propose VEXA, an evidence-grounded and persona-adaptive framework for generating learner-facing scam explanations by integrating GradientSHAP-based attribution with theory-informed vulnerability personas. Evaluation across multi-channel datasets shows that grounding explanations in detector-derived evidence improves semantic reliability without increasing linguistic complexity, while persona conditioning introduces interpretable stylistic variation without disrupting evidential alignment. These results reveal a key design insight: evidential grounding governs semantic correctness, whereas persona-based adaptation operates at the level of presentation under constraints of faithfulness. Together, VEXA demonstrates the feasibility of persona-adaptive, evidence-grounded explanations and provides design guidance for trustworthy, learner-facing security explanations in non-formal contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05056v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Large Language Models on Solved and Unsolved Problems in Graph Theory: Implications for Computing Education</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05059</link><description>arXiv:2602.05059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.
  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.
  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05059v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StagePilot: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Stage-Controlled Cybergrooming Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05060</link><description>arXiv:2602.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cybergrooming is an evolving threat to youth, necessitating proactive educational interventions. We propose StagePilot, an offline RL-based dialogue agent that simulates the stage-wise progression of grooming behaviors for prevention training. StagePilot selects conversational stages using a composite reward that balances user sentiment and goal proximity, with transitions constrained to adjacent stages for realism and interpretability. We evaluate StagePilot through LLM-based simulations, measuring stage completion, dialogue efficiency, and emotional engagement. Results show that StagePilot generates realistic and coherent conversations aligned with grooming dynamics. Among tested methods, the IQL+AWAC agent achieves the best balance between strategic planning and emotional coherence, reaching the final stage up to 43% more frequently than baselines while maintaining over 70% sentiment alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05060v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Laws for Embedding Dimension in Information Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05062</link><description>arXiv:2602.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense retrieval, which encodes queries and documents into a single dense vector, has become the dominant neural retrieval approach due to its simplicity and compatibility with fast approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. As the tasks dense retrieval performs grow in complexity, the fundamental limitations of the underlying data structure and similarity metric -- namely vectors and inner-products -- become more apparent. Prior recent work has shown theoretical limitations inherent to single vectors and inner-products that are generally tied to the embedding dimension. Given the importance of embedding dimension for retrieval capacity, understanding how dense retrieval performance changes as embedding dimension is scaled is fundamental to building next generation retrieval models that balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between embedding dimension and retrieval performance. Our experiments include two model families and a range of model sizes from each to construct a detailed picture of embedding scaling behavior. We find that the scaling behavior fits a power law, allowing us to derive scaling laws for performance given only embedding dimension, as well as a joint law accounting for embedding dimension and model size. Our analysis shows that for evaluation tasks aligned with the training task, performance continues to improve as embedding size increases, though with diminishing returns. For evaluation data that is less aligned with the training task, we find that performance is less predictable, with performance degrading with larger embedding dimensions for certain tasks. We hope our work provides additional insight into the limitations of embeddings and their behavior as well as offers a practical guide for selecting model and embedding dimension to achieve optimal performance with reduced storage and compute costs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05062v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Design Space for Live Music Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05064</link><description>arXiv:2602.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Live music provides a uniquely rich setting for studying creativity and interaction due to its spontaneous nature. The pursuit of live music agents--intelligent systems supporting real-time music performance and interaction--has captivated researchers across HCI, AI, and computer music for decades, and recent advancements in AI suggest unprecedented opportunities to evolve their design. However, the interdisciplinary nature of music has led to fragmented development across research communities, hindering effective communication and collaborative progress. In this work, we bring together perspectives from these diverse fields to map the current landscape of live music agents. Based on our analysis of 184 systems across both academic literature and video, we develop a comprehensive design space that categorizes dimensions spanning usage contexts, interactions, technologies, and ecosystems. By highlighting trends and gaps in live music agents, our design space offers researchers, designers, and musicians a structured lens to understand existing systems and shape future directions in real-time human-AI music co-creation. We release our annotated systems as a living artifact at https://live-music-agents.github.io.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Does SGD Seek Flatness or Sharpness?

Abstract: A large body of theory and empirical work hypothesizes a connection between the flatness of a neural network's loss landscape during training and its performance. However, there have been conceptually opposite pieces of evidence regarding when SGD prefers flatter or sharper solutions during training. In this work, we partially but causally clarify the flatness-seeking behavior of SGD by identifying and exactly solving an analytically solvable model that exhibits both flattening and sharpening behavior during training. In this model, the SGD training has no \textit{a priori} preference for flatness, but only a preference for minimal gradient fluctuations. This leads to the insight that, at least within this model, it is data distribution that uniquely determines the sharpness at convergence, and that a flat minimum is preferred if and only if the noise in the labels is isotropic across all output dimensions. When the noise in the labels is anisotropic, the model instead prefers sharpness and can converge to an arbitrarily sharp solution, depending on the imbalance in the noise in the labels spectrum. We reproduce this key insight in controlled settings with different model architectures such as MLP, RNN, and transformers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05065v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bypassing AI Control Protocols via Agent-as-a-Proxy Attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05066</link><description>arXiv:2602.05066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI agents automate critical workloads, they remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks. Current defenses rely on monitoring protocols that jointly evaluate an agent's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool-use actions to ensure alignment with user intent. We demonstrate that these monitoring-based defenses can be bypassed via a novel Agent-as-a-Proxy attack, where prompt injection attacks treat the agent as a delivery mechanism, bypassing both agent and monitor simultaneously. While prior work on scalable oversight has focused on whether small monitors can supervise large agents, we show that even frontier-scale monitors are vulnerable. Large-scale monitoring models like Qwen2.5-72B can be bypassed by agents with similar capabilities, such as GPT-4o mini and Llama-3.1-70B. On the AgentDojo benchmark, we achieve a high attack success rate against AlignmentCheck and Extract-and-Evaluate monitors under diverse monitoring LLMs. Our findings suggest current monitoring-based agentic defenses are fundamentally fragile regardless of model scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05066v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] E-Globe: Scalable $\epsilon$-Global Verification of Neural Networks via Tight Upper Bounds and Pattern-Aware Branching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05068</link><description>arXiv:2602.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks achieve strong empirical performance, but robustness concerns still hinder deployment in safety-critical applications. Formal verification provides robustness guarantees, but current methods face a scalability-completeness trade-off. We propose a hybrid verifier in a branch-and-bound (BaB) framework that efficiently tightens both upper and lower bounds until an $\epsilon-$global optimum is reached or early stop is triggered. The key is an exact nonlinear program with complementarity constraints (NLP-CC) for upper bounding that preserves the ReLU input-output graph, so any feasible solution yields a valid counterexample and enables rapid pruning of unsafe subproblems. We further accelerate verification with (i) warm-started NLP solves requiring minimal constraint-matrix updates and (ii) pattern-aligned strong branching that prioritizes splits most effective at tightening relaxations. We also provide conditions under which NLP-CC upper bounds are tight. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show markedly tighter upper bounds than PGD across perturbation radii spanning up to three orders of magnitude, fast per-node solves in practice, and substantial end-to-end speedups over MIP-based verification, amplified by warm-starting, GPU batching, and pattern-aligned branching.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05068v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Correcting Contextual Deletions in DNA Nanopore Readouts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05072</link><description>arXiv:2602.05072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of designing codes for deletion-correction and synchronization has received renewed interest due to applications in DNA-based data storage systems that use nanopore sequencers as readout platforms. In almost all instances, deletions are assumed to be imposed independently of each other and of the sequence context. These assumptions are not valid in practice, since nanopore errors tend to occur within specific contexts. We study contextual nanopore deletion-errors through the example setting of deterministic single deletions following (complete) runlengths of length at least $k$. The model critically depends on the runlength threshold $k$, and we examine two regimes for $k$: a) $k=C\log n$ for a constant $C\in(0,1)$; in this case, we study error-correcting codes that can protect from a constant number $t$ of contextual deletions, and show that the minimum redundancy (ignoring lower-order terms) is between $(1-C)t\log n$ and $2(1-C)t\log n$, meaning that it is a ($1-C$)-fraction of that of arbitrary $t$-deletion-correcting codes. To complement our non-constructive redundancy upper bound, we design efficiently and encodable and decodable codes for any constant $t$. In particular, for $t=1$ and $C&gt;1/2$ we construct efficient codes with redundancy that essentially matches our non-constructive upper bound; b) $k$ equal a constant; in this case we consider the extremal problem where the number of deletions is not bounded and a deletion is imposed after every run of length at least $k$, which we call the extremal contextual deletion channel. This combinatorial setting arises naturally by considering a probabilistic channel that introduces contextual deletions after each run of length at least $k$ with probability $p$ and taking the limit $p\to 1$. We obtain sharp bounds on the maximum achievable rate under the extremal contextual deletion channel for arbitrary constant $k$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05072v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05073</link><description>arXiv:2602.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05073v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimizing Mission Planning for Multi-Debris Rendezvous Using Reinforcement Learning with Refueling and Adaptive Collision Avoidance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05075</link><description>arXiv:2602.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.
  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.
  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.
  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05075v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Food Portion Estimation: From Pixels to Calories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05078</link><description>arXiv:2602.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliance on images for dietary assessment is an important strategy to accurately and conveniently monitor an individual's health, making it a vital mechanism in the prevention and care of chronic diseases and obesity. However, image-based dietary assessment suffers from estimating the three dimensional size of food from 2D image inputs. Many strategies have been devised to overcome this critical limitation such as the use of auxiliary inputs like depth maps, multi-view inputs, or model-based approaches such as template matching. Deep learning also helps bridge the gap by either using monocular images or combinations of the image and the auxillary inputs to precisely predict the output portion from the image input. In this paper, we explore the different strategies employed for accurate portion estimation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05078v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Learning Enhancement Using Vector Semantic Representation and Symbolic Reasoning for Human-Centered Autonomous Emergency Braking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05079</link><description>arXiv:2602.05079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem with existing camera-based Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches is twofold: they rarely integrate high-level scene context into the feature representation, and they rely on rigid, fixed reward functions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel pipeline that produces a neuro-symbolic feature representation that encompasses semantic, spatial, and shape information, as well as spatially boosted features of dynamic entities in the scene, with an emphasis on safety-critical road users. It also proposes a Soft First-Order Logic (SFOL) reward function that balances human values via a symbolic reasoning module. Here, semantic and spatial predicates are extracted from segmentation maps and applied to linguistic rules to obtain reward weights. Quantitative experiments in the CARLA simulation environment show that the proposed neuro-symbolic representation and SFOL reward function improved policy robustness and safety-related performance metrics compared to baseline representations and reward formulations across varying traffic densities and occlusion levels. The findings demonstrate that integrating holistic representations and soft reasoning into Reinforcement Learning can support more context-aware and value-aligned decision-making for autonomous driving.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05079v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gabor Fields: Orientation-Selective Level-of-Detail for Volume Rendering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05081</link><description>arXiv:2602.05081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian-based representations have enabled efficient physically-based volume rendering at a fraction of the memory cost of regular, discrete, voxel-based distributions. However, several remaining issues hamper their widespread use. One of the advantages of classic voxel grids is the ease of constructing hierarchical representations by either storing volumetric mipmaps or selectively pruning branches of an already hierarchical voxel grid. Such strategies reduce rendering time and eliminate aliasing when lower levels of detail are required. Constructing similar strategies for Gaussian-based volumes is not trivial. Straightforward solutions, such as prefiltering or computing mipmap-style representations, lead to increased memory requirements or expensive re-fitting of each level separately. Additionally, such solutions do not guarantee a smooth transition between different hierarchy levels. To address these limitations, we propose Gabor Fields, an orientation-selective mixture of Gabor kernels that enables continuous frequency filtering at no cost. The frequency content of the asset is reduced by selectively pruning primitives, directly benefiting rendering performance. Beyond filtering, we demonstrate that stochastically sampling from different frequencies and orientations at each ray recursion enables masking substantial portions of the volume, accelerating ray traversal time in single- and multiple-scattering settings. Furthermore, inspired by procedural volumes, we present an application for efficient design and rendering of procedural clouds as Gabor-noise-modulated Gaussians.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05081v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reliable Explanations or Random Noise? A Reliability Metric for XAI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05082</link><description>arXiv:2602.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05082v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Individual Fairness In Strategic Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05084</link><description>arXiv:2602.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategic classification, where individuals modify their features to influence machine learning (ML) decisions, presents critical fairness challenges. While group fairness in this setting has been widely studied, individual fairness remains underexplored. We analyze threshold-based classifiers and prove that deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness. Then, we investigate the possibility of using a randomized classifier to achieve individual fairness. We introduce conditions under which a randomized classifier ensures individual fairness and leverage these conditions to find an optimal and individually fair randomized classifier through a linear programming problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to group fairness notions. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method effectively mitigates unfairness and improves the fairness-accuracy trade-off.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05084v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Locas: Your Models are Principled Initializers of Locally-Supported Parametric Memories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05085</link><description>arXiv:2602.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to bridge test-time-training with a new type of parametric memory that can be flexibly offloaded from or merged into model parameters. We present Locas, a Locally-Supported parametric memory that shares the design of FFN blocks in modern transformers, allowing it to be flexibly permanentized into the model parameters while supporting efficient continual learning. We discuss two major variants of Locas: one with a conventional two-layer MLP design that has a clearer theoretical guarantee; the other one shares the same GLU-FFN structure with SOTA LLMs, and can be easily attached to existing models for both parameter-efficient and computation-efficient continual learning. Crucially, we show that proper initialization of such low-rank sideway-FFN-style memories -- performed in a principled way by reusing model parameters, activations and/or gradients -- is essential for fast convergence, improved generalization, and catastrophic forgetting prevention. We validate the proposed memory mechanism on the PG-19 whole-book language modeling and LoCoMo long-context dialogue question answering tasks. With only 0.02\% additional parameters in the lowest case, Locas-GLU is capable of storing the information from past context while maintaining a much smaller context window. In addition, we also test the model's general capability loss after memorizing the whole book with Locas, through comparative MMLU evaluation. Results show the promising ability of Locas to permanentize past context into parametric knowledge with minimized catastrophic forgetting of the model's existing internal knowledge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05085v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autodiscover: A reinforcement learning recommendation system for the cold-start imbalance challenge in active learning, powered by graph-aware thompson sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05087</link><description>arXiv:2602.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are fundamental to evidence-based research, but manual screening is an increasing bottleneck as scientific output grows. Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05087v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VERA-MH: Reliability and Validity of an Open-Source AI Safety Evaluation in Mental Health</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05088</link><description>arXiv:2602.05088v1 Announce Type: new

This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05088v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beware Untrusted Simulators -- Reward-Free Backdoor Attacks in Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05089</link><description>arXiv:2602.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulated environments are a key piece in the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), allowing practitioners and researchers to train decision making agents without running expensive experiments on real hardware. Simulators remain a security blind spot, however, enabling adversarial developers to alter the dynamics of their released simulators for malicious purposes. Therefore, in this work we highlight a novel threat, demonstrating how simulator dynamics can be exploited to stealthily implant action-level backdoors into RL agents. The backdoor then allows an adversary to reliably activate targeted actions in an agent upon observing a predefined ``trigger'', leading to potentially dangerous consequences. Traditional backdoor attacks are limited in their strong threat models, assuming the adversary has near full control over an agent's training pipeline, enabling them to both alter and observe agent's rewards. As these assumptions are infeasible to implement within a simulator, we propose a new attack ``Daze'' which is able to reliably and stealthily implant backdoors into RL agents trained for real world tasks without altering or even observing their rewards. We provide formal proof of Daze's effectiveness in guaranteeing attack success across general RL tasks along with extensive empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous action space domains. We additionally provide the first example of RL backdoor attacks transferring to real, robotic hardware. These developments motivate further research into securing all components of the RL training pipeline to prevent malicious attacks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05089v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Robustness and Adaptability in Learning-Based Mission Planning for Active Debris Removal</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05091</link><description>arXiv:2602.05091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VR Calm Plus: Coupling a Squeezable Tangible Interaction with Immersive VR for Stress Regulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05093</link><description>arXiv:2602.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly employed for stress management, most applications rely heavily on audio-visual stimuli and overlook the therapeutic potential of squeezing engagement. To address this gap, we introduce VR Calm Plus, a multimodal system that integrates a pressure-sensitive plush toy into an interactive VR environment. This interface allows users to dynamically modulate the virtual atmosphere through physical squeezing actions, fostering a deeper sense of embodied relaxation. We evaluated the system with 40 participants using PANAS-X surveys, subjective questionnaires, physiological measures (heart rate, skin conductance, pulse rate variability), and semi-structured interviews. Results demonstrate that, compared to a visual-only baseline, squeeze-based interaction significantly enhances positive affect and perceived relaxation. Physiological data further revealed a state of "active relaxation", characterized by greater reductions in heart rate and preserved autonomic flexibility (PRV), alongside sustained emotional engagement (GSR). Our findings highlight the value of coupling tangible input with immersive environments to support emotional well-being and offer design insights for future VR-based mental health tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05093v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Visual concept ranking uncovers medical shortcuts used by large multimodal models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05096</link><description>arXiv:2602.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains such as healthcare requires auditing methods that can uncover model shortcomings. We introduce a method for identifying important visual concepts within large multimodal models (LMMs) and use it to investigate the behaviors these models exhibit when prompted with medical tasks. We primarily focus on the task of classifying malignant skin lesions from clinical dermatology images, with supplemental experiments including both chest radiographs and natural images. After showing how LMMs display unexpected gaps in performance between different demographic subgroups when prompted with demonstrating examples, we apply our method, Visual Concept Ranking (VCR), to these models and prompts. VCR generates hypotheses related to different visual feature dependencies, which we are then able to validate with manual interventions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05096v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On QC and GQC algebraic geometry codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05097</link><description>arXiv:2602.05097v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Crypto-assets are a main segment of electronic markets, with growing trade volume and market share, yet there's no unified and comprehensive asset level taxonomy framework. This paper develops a multidimensional taxonomy for crypto-assets that connects technical design to market structure and regulation. Building on established taxonomy guideline and existing models, we derive dimensions from theory, regulatory frameworks, and case studies. We then map top 100 assets within the structure and provide several detailed case studies. The taxonomy covers technology standard, centralisation of critical resources, asset function, legal classification and mechanism designs of minting, yield, redemption. The asset mapping and case studies reveal recurring design patterns, capture features of edge cases that sit on boundaries of current categorisations, and document centralised control of nominal decentralised assets. This paper provides framework for systematic study for crypto markets, supports regulators in assessing token risks, and offers investors and digital platform designers a tool to compare assets when building or participate in electronic markets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05098v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rule-Based Spatial Mixture-of-Experts U-Net for Explainable Edge Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05100</link><description>arXiv:2602.05100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models like U-Net and its variants, have established state-of-the-art performance in edge detection tasks and are used by Generative AI services world-wide for their image generation models. However, their decision-making processes remain opaque, operating as "black boxes" that obscure the rationale behind specific boundary predictions. This lack of transparency is a critical barrier in safety-critical applications where verification is mandatory. To bridge the gap between high-performance deep learning and interpretable logic, we propose the Rule-Based Spatial Mixture-of-Experts U-Net (sMoE U-Net). Our architecture introduces two key innovations: (1) Spatially-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (sMoE) blocks integrated into the decoder skip connections, which dynamically gate between "Context" (smooth) and "Boundary" (sharp) experts based on local feature statistics; and (2) a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) Fuzzy Head that replaces the standard classification layer. This fuzzy head fuses deep semantic features with heuristic edge signals using explicit IF-THEN rules. We evaluate our method on the BSDS500 benchmark, achieving an Optimal Dataset Scale (ODS) F-score of 0.7628, effectively matching purely deep baselines like HED (0.7688) while outperforming the standard U-Net (0.7437). Crucially, our model provides pixel-level explainability through "Rule Firing Maps" and "Strategy Maps," allowing users to visualize whether an edge was detected due to strong gradients, high semantic confidence, or specific logical rule combinations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05100v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GAMMS: Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05105</link><description>arXiv:2602.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination become increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible. Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments. We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling. The framework is open-source and available at https://github.com/GAMMSim/GAMMS/</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05105v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data Kernel Perspective Space Performance Guarantees for Synthetic Data from Transformer Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05106</link><description>arXiv:2602.05106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scarcity of labeled training data remains the long pole in the tent for building performant language technology and generative AI models. Transformer models -- particularly LLMs -- are increasingly being used to mitigate the data scarcity problem via synthetic data generation. However, because the models are black boxes, the properties of the synthetic data are difficult to predict. In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models. We first show the mathematical derivation of DKPS and how it provides performance guarantees. Next we show how DKPS performance guarantees can elucidate performance of a downstream task, such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO). Limitations of the current work and future research are also discussed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05106v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multilingual Extraction and Recognition of Implicit Discourse Relations in Speech and Text</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05107</link><description>arXiv:2602.05107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit discourse relation classification is a challenging task, as it requires inferring meaning from context. While contextual cues can be distributed across modalities and vary across languages, they are not always captured by text alone. To address this, we introduce an automatic method for distantly related and unrelated language pairs to construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset for implicit discourse relations in English, French, and Spanish. For classification, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio, allowing joint modeling of text and audio for implicit discourse relation classification across languages. We find that while text-based models outperform audio-based models, integrating both modalities can enhance performance, and cross-lingual transfer can provide substantial improvements for low-resource languages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05107v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Blockchain Technology for Public Services: A Polycentric Governance Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05109</link><description>arXiv:2602.05109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: National governments are increasingly adopting blockchain to enhance transparency, trust, and efficiency in public service delivery. However, evidence on how these technologies are governed across national contexts remains fragmented and overly focused on technical features. Using Polycentric Governance Theory, this study conducts a systematic review of peer-reviewed research published between 2021 and 2025 to examine blockchain-enabled public services and the institutional, organizational, and information-management factors shaping their adoption. Following PRISMA guidelines, we synthesize findings from major digital government and information systems databases to identify key application domains, including digital identity, electronic voting, procurement, and social services, and analyze the governance arrangements underpinning these initiatives. Our analysis reveals that blockchain adoption is embedded within polycentric environments characterized by distributed authority, inter-organizational coordination, and layered accountability. Rather than adopting full decentralization, governments typically utilize hybrid and permissioned designs that allow for selective decentralization alongside centralized oversight, a pattern we conceptualize as "controlled polycentricity." By reframing blockchain as a governance infrastructure that encodes rules for coordination and information-sharing, this study advances digital government theory beyond simple adoption metrics. The findings offer theoretically grounded insights for researchers and practical guidance for policymakers seeking to design and scale sustainable blockchain-enabled public services.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05109v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding LLM Evaluator Behavior: A Structured Multi-Evaluator Framework for Merchant Risk Assessment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05110</link><description>arXiv:2602.05110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, yet their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood. We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05110v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Democratic Preference Alignment via Sortition-Weighted RLHF</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05113</link><description>arXiv:2602.05113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05113v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Generation and Validation of Isomorphic Physics Problems with GenAI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05114</link><description>arXiv:2602.05114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional synchronous STEM assessments face growing challenges including accessibility barriers, security concerns from resource-sharing platforms, and limited comparability across institutions. We present a framework for generating and evaluating large-scale isomorphic physics problem banks using Generative AI to enable asynchronous, multi-attempt assessments. Isomorphic problems test identical concepts through varied surface features and contexts, providing richer variation than conventional parameterized questions while maintaining consistent difficulty. Our generation framework employs prompt chaining and tool use to achieve precise control over structural variations (numeric values, spatial relations) alongside diverse contextual variations. For pre-deployment validation, we evaluate generated items using 17 open-source language models (LMs) (0.6B-32B) and compare against actual student performance (N&gt;200) across three midterm exams. Results show that 73% of deployed banks achieve statistically homogeneous difficulty, and LMs pattern correlate strongly with student performance (Pearson's $\rho$ up to 0.594). Additionally, LMs successfully identify problematic variants, such as ambiguous problem texts. Model scale also proves critical for effective validation, where extremely small (&lt;4B) and large (&gt;14B) models exhibit floor and ceiling effects respectively, making mid-sized models optimal for detecting difficulty outliers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SocialVeil: Probing Social Intelligence of Language Agents under Communication Barriers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05115</link><description>arXiv:2602.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in interactive environments to test their social intelligence. However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \emph{semantic vagueness}, \emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \emph{unresolved confusion} and \emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05115v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GPU-to-Grid: Voltage Regulation via GPU Utilization Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05116</link><description>arXiv:2602.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the rapid expansion of data centers poses challenges for power grids, it also offers new opportunities as potentially flexible loads. Existing power system research often abstracts data centers as aggregate resources, while computer system research primarily focuses on optimizing GPU energy efficiency and largely ignores the grid impacts of optimized GPU power consumption. To bridge this gap, we develop a GPU-to-Grid framework that couples device-level GPU control with power system objectives. We study distribution-level voltage regulation enabled by flexibility in LLM inference, using batch size as a control knob that trades off the voltage impacts of GPU power consumption against inference latency and token throughput. We first formulate this problem as an optimization problem and then realize it as an online feedback optimization controller that leverages measurements from both the power grid and GPU systems. Our key insight is that reducing GPU power consumption alleviates violations of lower voltage limits, while increasing GPU power mitigates violations near upper voltage limits in distribution systems; this runs counter to the common belief that minimizing GPU power consumption is always beneficial to power grids.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05116v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unbiased Single-Queried Gradient for Combinatorial Objective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05119</link><description>arXiv:2602.05119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a probabilistic reformulation of a combinatorial problem, we often face an optimization over a hypercube, which corresponds to the Bernoulli probability parameter for each binary variable in the primal problem. The combinatorial nature suggests that an exact gradient computation requires multiple queries. We propose a stochastic gradient that is unbiased and requires only a single query of the combinatorial function. This method encompasses a well-established REINFORCE (through an importance sampling), as well as including a class of new stochastic gradients.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05119v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Certifiable Boolean Reasoning Is Universal</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05120</link><description>arXiv:2602.05120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of agentic systems has thrust the reasoning capabilities of AI into the forefront of contemporary machine learning. While it is known that there \emph{exist} neural networks which can reason through any Boolean task $f:\{0,1\}^B\to\{0,1\}$, in the sense that they emulate Boolean circuits with fan-in $2$ and fan-out $1$ gates, trained models have been repeatedly demonstrated to fall short of these theoretical ideals. This raises the question: \textit{Can one exhibit a deep learning model which \textbf{certifiably} always reasons and can \textbf{universally} reason through any Boolean task?} Moreover, such a model should ideally require few parameters to solve simple Boolean tasks.
  We answer this question affirmatively by exhibiting a deep learning architecture which parameterizes distributions over Boolean circuits with the guarantee that, for every parameter configuration, a sample is almost surely a valid Boolean circuit (and hence admits an intrinsic circuit-level certificate). We then prove a universality theorem: for any Boolean $f:\{0,1\}^B\to\{0,1\}$, there exists a parameter configuration under which the sampled circuit computes $f$ with arbitrarily high probability. When $f$ is an $\mathcal{O}(\log B)$-junta, the required number of parameters scales linearly with the input dimension $B$.
  Empirically, on a controlled truth-table completion benchmark aligned with our setting, the proposed architecture trains reliably and achieves high exact-match accuracy while preserving the predicted structure: every internal unit is Boolean-valued on $\{0,1\}^B$. Matched MLP baselines reach comparable accuracy, but only about $10\%$ of hidden units admit a Boolean representation; i.e.\ are two-valued over the Boolean cube.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05120v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trojan Attacks on Neural Network Controllers for Robotic Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05121</link><description>arXiv:2602.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network controllers are increasingly deployed in robotic systems for tasks such as trajectory tracking and pose stabilization. However, their reliance on potentially untrusted training pipelines or supply chains introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This paper investigates backdoor (Trojan) attacks against neural controllers, using a differential-drive mobile robot platform as a case study. In particular, assuming that the robot's tracking controller is implemented as a neural network, we design a lightweight, parallel Trojan network that can be embedded within the controller. This malicious module remains dormant during normal operation but, upon detecting a highly specific trigger condition defined by the robot's pose and goal parameters, compromises the primary controller's wheel velocity commands, resulting in undesired and potentially unsafe robot behaviours. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed Trojan network, which is validated through simulation under two different attack scenarios. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed attack and demonstrate that neural network-based robotic control systems are subject to potentially critical security threats.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05121v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exceptional Behaviors: How Frequently Are They Tested?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05123</link><description>arXiv:2602.05123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptions allow developers to handle error cases expected to occur infrequently. Ideally, good test suites should test both normal and exceptional behaviors to catch more bugs and avoid regressions. While current research analyzes exceptions that propagate to tests, it does not explore other exceptions that do not reach the tests. In this paper, we provide an empirical study to explore how frequently exceptional behaviors are tested in real-world systems. We consider both exceptions that propagate to tests and the ones that do not reach the tests. For this purpose, we run an instrumented version of test suites, monitor their execution, and collect information about the exceptions raised at runtime. We analyze the test suites of 25 Python systems, covering 5,372 executed methods, 17.9M calls, and 1.4M raised exceptions. We find that 21.4% of the executed methods do raise exceptions at runtime. In methods that raise exceptions, on the median, 1 in 10 calls exercise exceptional behaviors. Close to 80% of the methods that raise exceptions do so infrequently, but about 20% raise exceptions more frequently. Finally, we provide implications for researchers and practitioners. We suggest developing novel tools to support exercising exceptional behaviors and refactoring expensive try/except blocks. We also call attention to the fact that exception-raising behaviors are not necessarily "abnormal" or rare.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05123v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Fixed-Point Framework for High-Dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi Equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05124</link><description>arXiv:2602.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel, mesh-free, and gradient-free fixed-point approach for computing viscosity solutions of high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. By leveraging the Hopf-Lax formula, our approach iteratively solves the associated variational problem via a Picard iteration, enabling efficient evaluation of both the solution and its corresponding control without relying on grids, characteristics, or differentiation. We demonstrate the practical efficacy and scalability of the approach through numerical experiments in up to 100 dimensions, including control problems and non-smooth solutions. Our results show that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy, is highly efficient, and exhibits computational times that are largely independent of dimensionality, highlighting its suitability for high-dimensional problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Rubric Generation for Improving LLM Judge and Reward Modeling for Open-ended Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05125</link><description>arXiv:2602.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, rubrics have been used to guide LLM judges in capturing subjective, nuanced, multi-dimensional human preferences, and have been extended from evaluation to reward signals for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench. Overall, RRD establishes recursive rubric refinement as a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05125v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CLEAR-HPV: Interpretable Concept Discovery for HPV-Associated Morphology in Whole-Slide Histology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05126</link><description>arXiv:2602.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) status is a critical determinant of prognosis and treatment response in head and neck and cervical cancers. Although attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) achieves strong slide-level prediction for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, it provides limited morphologic interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept-Level Explainable Attention-guided Representation for HPV (CLEAR-HPV), a framework that restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training. Operating in an attention-weighted latent space, CLEAR-HPV automatically discovers keratinizing, basaloid, and stromal morphologic concepts, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector. CLEAR-HPV's concept-fraction vectors preserve the predictive information of the original MIL embeddings while reducing the high-dimensional feature space (e.g., 1536 dimensions) to only 10 interpretable concepts. CLEAR-HPV generalizes consistently across TCGA-HNSCC, TCGA-CESC, and CPTAC-HNSCC, providing compact, concept-level interpretability through a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05126v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reporting and Reviewing LLM-Integrated Systems in HCI: Challenges and Considerations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05128</link><description>arXiv:2602.05128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What should HCI scholars consider when reporting and reviewing papers that involve LLM-integrated systems? We interview 18 authors of LLM-integrated system papers on their authoring and reviewing experiences. We find that norms of trust-building between authors and reviewers appear to be eroded by the uncertainty of LLM behavior and hyperbolic rhetoric surrounding AI. Authors perceive that reviewers apply uniquely skeptical and inconsistent standards towards papers that report LLM-integrated systems, and mitigate mistrust by adding technical evaluations, justifying usage, and de-emphasizing LLM presence. Authors' views challenge blanket directives to report all prompts and use open models, arguing that prompt reporting is context-dependent and justifying proprietary model usage despite ethical concerns. Finally, some tensions in peer review appear to stem from clashes between the norms and values of HCI and ML/NLP communities, particularly around what constitutes a contribution and an appropriate level of technical rigor. Based on our findings and additional feedback from six expert HCI researchers, we present a set of guidelines and considerations for authors, reviewers, and HCI communities around reporting and reviewing papers that involve LLM-integrated systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05128v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Advancing Research with Workflows: A perspective from the Workflows Community Summit -- Amsterdam, 2025</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05131</link><description>arXiv:2602.05131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific workflows have become essential for orchestrating complex computational processes across distributed resources, managing large datasets, and ensuring reproducibility in modern research. The Workflows Community Summit 2025, held in Amsterdam on June 6th, 2025, convened international experts to examine emerging challenges and opportunities in this domain. Participants identified key barriers to workflow adoption, including tensions between system generality and domain-specific utility, concerns over long-term sustainability of workflow systems and services, insufficient recognition for those who develop and maintain reproducible workflows, and gaps in standardization, funding, training, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address these challenges, the summit proposed action lines spanning technology, policy, and community dimensions: shifting evaluation metrics from raw computational performance toward measuring genuine scientific impact; formalizing workflow patterns and community-driven benchmarks to improve transparency, reproducibility, and usability; cultivating a cohesive international workflows community that engages funding bodies and research stakeholders; and investing in human capital through dedicated workflow engineering roles, career pathways, and integration of workflow concepts into educational curricula and long-term training initiatives. This document presents the summit's findings, beginning with an overview of the current computing ecosystem and the rationale for workflow-centric approaches, followed by a discussion of identified challenges and recommended action lines for advancing scientific discovery through workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05131v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARGaze: Autoregressive Transformers for Online Egocentric Gaze Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05132</link><description>arXiv:2602.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online egocentric gaze estimation predicts where a camera wearer is looking from first-person video using only past and current frames, a task essential for augmented reality and assistive technologies. Unlike third-person gaze estimation, this setting lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from sparse, indirect cues such as hand-object interactions and salient scene content. We observe that gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities: knowing where a person looked recently provides a powerful prior for predicting where they look next. Inspired by vision-conditioned autoregressive decoding in vision-language models, we propose ARGaze, which reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction: at each timestep, a transformer decoder predicts current gaze by conditioning on (i) current visual features and (ii) a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates. This design enforces causality and enables bounded-resource streaming inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction. We will release our source code and pre-trained models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CAST-CKT: Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer for Traffic Flow Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05133</link><description>arXiv:2602.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning on tabular data relies on complex data preparation pipelines for prediction, data integration, augmentation, and debugging. Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity. We implement SemPipes in Python and release it at https://github.com/deem-data/sempipes/tree/v1.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05134v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoupled Orthogonal Dynamics: Regularization for Deep Network Optimizers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05136</link><description>arXiv:2602.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is the standard weight decay in AdamW truly optimal? Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters. Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05136v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Exploration for Latent-State Bandits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05139</link><description>arXiv:2602.05139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-armed bandit problem is a core framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical algorithms often fail in environments with hidden, time-varying states that confound reward estimation and optimal action selection. We address key challenges arising from unobserved confounders, such as biased reward estimates and limited state information, by introducing a family of state-model-free bandit algorithms that leverage lagged contextual features and coordinated probing strategies. These implicitly track latent states and disambiguate state-dependent reward patterns. Our methods and their adaptive variants can learn optimal policies without explicit state modeling, combining computational efficiency with robust adaptation to non-stationary rewards. Empirical results across diverse settings demonstrate superior performance over classical approaches, and we provide practical recommendations for algorithm selection in real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05139v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HugRAG: Hierarchical Causal Knowledge Graph Design for RAG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05143</link><description>arXiv:2602.05143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05143v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fairness Under Group-Conditional Prior Probability Shift: Invariance, Drift, and Target-Aware Post-Processing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05144</link><description>arXiv:2602.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning systems are often trained and evaluated for fairness on historical data, yet deployed in environments where conditions have shifted. A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain. Experiments validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that TAP-GPPS achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05144v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TIDE: Temporal Incremental Draft Engine for Self-Improving LLM Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05145</link><description>arXiv:2602.05145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding can substantially accelerate LLM inference, but realizing its benefits in practice is challenging due to evolving workloads and system-level constraints. We present TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine), a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation directly into high-performance LLM inference systems. TIDE reuses target model hidden states generated during inference as training signals, enabling zero-overhead draft adaptation without reloading the target model, and employs adaptive runtime control to activate speculation and training only when beneficial. TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes. Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05145v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-talk based multi-task learning for fault classification of physically coupled machine system</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05146</link><description>arXiv:2602.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine systems inherently generate signals in which fault conditions and various physical variables are physically coupled. Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset. In this system, each fault component, inner race fault, outer race fault, misalignment, and unbalance is coupled to the other. For motor compound fault, we also test classification performance when we use single-channel data or multi-channel data as input to the classifier. Across both benchmarks, our residual neural dimension reductor, consistently outperformed single-task models, multi-class models that merge all label combinations, and shared trunk multi-task models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoSA: Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05148</link><description>arXiv:2602.05148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) without updating all parameters. Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05148v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GreekMMLU: A Native-Sourced Multitask Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models in Greek</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05150</link><description>arXiv:2602.05150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multilingual corpora that include Greek, yet reliable evaluation benchmarks for Greek-particularly those based on authentic, native-sourced content-remain limited. Existing datasets are often machine-translated from English, failing to capture Greek linguistic and cultural characteristics. We introduce GreekMMLU, a native-sourced benchmark for massive multitask language understanding in Greek, comprising 21,805 multiple-choice questions across 45 subject areas, organized under a newly defined subject taxonomy and annotated with educational difficulty levels spanning primary to professional examinations. All questions are sourced or authored in Greek from academic, professional, and governmental exams. We publicly release 16,857 samples and reserve 4,948 samples for a private leaderboard to enable robust and contamination-resistant evaluation. Evaluations of over 80 open- and closed-source LLMs reveal substantial performance gaps between frontier and open-weight models, as well as between Greek-adapted models and general multilingual ones. Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of factors influencing performance-including model scale, adaptation, and prompting-and derive insights for improving LLM capabilities in Greek.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAG without Forgetting: Continual Query-Infused Key Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05152</link><description>arXiv:2602.05152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems commonly improve robustness via query-time adaptations such as query expansion and iterative retrieval. While effective, these approaches are inherently stateless: adaptations are recomputed for each query and discarded thereafter, precluding cumulative learning and repeatedly incurring inference-time cost. Index-side approaches like key expansion introduce persistence but rely on offline preprocessing or heuristic updates that are weakly aligned with downstream task utility, leading to semantic drift and noise accumulation. We propose Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM), a training-free framework that transforms transient query-time gains into persistent retrieval improvements. ERM updates the retrieval index through correctness-gated feedback, selectively attributes atomic expansion signals to the document keys they benefit, and progressively evolves keys via stable, norm-bounded updates. We show that query and key expansion are theoretically equivalent under standard similarity functions and prove convergence of ERM's selective updates, amortizing optimal query expansion into a stable index with zero inference-time overhead. Experiments on BEIR and BRIGHT across 13 domains demonstrate consistent gains in retrieval and generation, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks, at native retrieval speed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05152v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PLATO Hand: Shaping Contact Behavior with Fingernails for Precise Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05156</link><description>arXiv:2602.05156v1 Announce Type: new

Together, these results show that coupling structured contact geometry with a force-motion transparent mechanism provides a principled, physically embodied approach to precise manipulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Necessity of a Holistic Safety Evaluation Framework for AI-Based Automation Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05157</link><description>arXiv:2602.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection of Safety of Intended Functionality (SOTIF) and Functional Safety (FuSa) analysis of driving automation features has traditionally excluded Quality Management (QM) components from rigorous safety impact evaluations. While QM components are not typically classified as safety-relevant, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) integration reveal that such components can contribute to SOTIF-related hazardous risks. Compliance with emerging AI safety standards, such as ISO/PAS 8800, necessitates re-evaluating safety considerations for these components. This paper examines the necessity of conducting holistic safety analysis and risk assessment on AI components, emphasizing their potential to introduce hazards with the capacity to violate risk acceptance criteria when deployed in safety-critical driving systems, particularly in perception algorithms. Using case studies, we demonstrate how deficiencies in AI-driven perception systems can emerge even in QM-classified components, leading to unintended functional behaviors with critical safety implications. By bridging theoretical analysis with practical examples, this paper argues for the adoption of comprehensive FuSa, SOTIF, and AI standards-driven methodologies to identify and mitigate risks in AI components. The findings demonstrate the importance of revising existing safety frameworks to address the evolving challenges posed by AI, ensuring comprehensive safety assurance across all component classifications spanning multiple safety standards.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05157v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AirGlove: Exploring Egocentric 3D Hand Tracking and Appearance Generalization for Sensing Gloves</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05159</link><description>arXiv:2602.05159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing gloves have become important tools for teleoperation and robotic policy learning as they are able to provide rich signals like speed, acceleration and tactile feedback. A common approach to track gloved hands is to directly use the sensor signals (e.g., angular velocity, gravity orientation) to estimate 3D hand poses. However, sensor-based tracking can be restrictive in practice as the accuracy is often impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality. Recent advances in vision-based approaches have achieved strong performance on human hands via large-scale pre-training, but their performance on gloved hands with distinct visual appearances remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups. Our analysis shows that existing bare-hand models suffer from substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to large appearance gap between bare-hand and glove designs. We therefore propose AirGlove, which leverages existing gloves to generalize the learned glove representations towards new gloves with limited data.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often inherit social and demographic biases from annotated data during model training, leading to unfair predictions, especially in the presence of sensitive attributes like race, age, gender etc. Existing methods fall prey to the inherent data imbalance between attribute groups and inadvertently emphasize on sensitive attributes, worsening unfairness and performance. To surmount these challenges, we propose SHaSaM (Submodular Hard Sample Mining), a novel combinatorial approach that models fairness-driven representation learning as a submodular hard-sample mining problem. Our two-stage approach comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which introduces a submodular subset selection strategy to mine hard positives and negatives - effectively mitigating data imbalance, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces a family of combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes. This unified formulation restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05162v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LOBSTgER-enhance: an underwater image enhancement pipeline</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05163</link><description>arXiv:2602.05163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater photography presents significant inherent challenges including reduced contrast, spatial blur, and wavelength-dependent color distortions. These effects can obscure the vibrancy of marine life and awareness photographers in particular are often challenged with heavy post-processing pipelines to correct for these distortions.
  We develop an image-to-image pipeline that learns to reverse underwater degradations by introducing a synthetic corruption pipeline and learning to reverse its effects with diffusion-based generation. Training and evaluation are performed on a small high-quality dataset of awareness photography images by Keith Ellenbogen. The proposed methodology achieves high perceptual consistency and strong generalization in synthesizing 512x768 images using a model of ~11M parameters after training from scratch on ~2.5k images.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05163v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Position: Capability Control Should be a Separate Goal From Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05164</link><description>arXiv:2602.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are trained on broad data distributions, yielding generalist capabilities that enable many downstream applications but also expand the space of potential misuse and failures. This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack. We further outline key open challenges in achieving such control, including the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05164v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EBPO: Empirical Bayes Shrinkage for Stabilizing Group-Relative Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05165</link><description>arXiv:2602.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05165v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ShapePuri: Shape Guided and Appearance Generalized Adversarial Purification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05175</link><description>arXiv:2602.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate impressive performance in visual recognition, but they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that is imperceptible to the human. Although existing defense strategies such as adversarial training and purification have achieved progress, diffusion-based purification often involves high computational costs and information loss. To address these challenges, we introduce Shape Guided Purification (ShapePuri), a novel defense framework enhances robustness by aligning model representations with stable structural invariants. ShapePuri integrates two components: a Shape Encoding Module (SEM) that provides dense geometric guidance through Signed Distance Functions (SDF), and a Global Appearance Debiasing (GAD) module that mitigates appearance bias via stochastic transformations. In our experiments, ShapePuri achieves $84.06\%$ clean accuracy and $81.64\%$ robust accuracy under the AutoAttack protocol, representing the first defense framework to surpass the $80\%$ threshold on this benchmark. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient adversarial defense that preserves prediction stability during inference without requiring auxiliary modules or additional computational cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05175v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Among Us: Measuring and Mitigating Malicious Contributions in Model Collaboration Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05176</link><description>arXiv:2602.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used in collaboration: multiple LMs trained by different parties collaborate through routing systems, multi-agent debate, model merging, and more. Critical safety risks remain in this decentralized paradigm: what if some of the models in multi-LLM systems are compromised or malicious? We first quantify the impact of malicious models by engineering four categories of malicious LMs, plug them into four types of popular model collaboration systems, and evaluate the compromised system across 10 datasets. We find that malicious models have a severe impact on the multi-LLM systems, especially for reasoning and safety domains where performance is lowered by 7.12% and 7.94% on average. We then propose mitigation strategies to alleviate the impact of malicious components, by employing external supervisors that oversee model collaboration to disable/mask them out to reduce their influence. On average, these strategies recover 95.31% of the initial performance, while making model collaboration systems fully resistant to malicious models remains an open research question.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05176v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Artificial Intelligence Models for Daily Coastal Hypoxia Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05178</link><description>arXiv:2602.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coastal hypoxia, especially in the northern part of Gulf of Mexico, presents a persistent ecological and economic concern. Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

Abstract: The growing reliance on prediction markets as epistemic infrastructures has positioned platforms like Polymarket as providers of objective, real-time probabilistic truth, yet the signals they produce often obscure uncertainty, strategic manipulation, and capital asymmetries, encouraging misplaced epistemic trust. This paper presents a qualitative sociotechnical audit of Polymarket (N = 27), combining digital ethnography, interpretive walkthroughs, and semi-structured interviews to examine how probabilistic authority is produced and contested. We introduce the concept of Prediction Laundering, drawing on MacFarlanes framework of knowledge transmission, to describe how subjective, high-uncertainty bets, strategic hedges, and capital-heavy whale activity are stripped of their original noise through algorithmic aggregation. We trace a four-stage laundering lifecycle: Structural Sanitization, where a centralized ontology scripts the bet-able future; Probabilistic Flattening, which collapses heterogeneous motives into a single signal; Architectural Masking, which conceals capital-driven influence behind apparent consensus; and Epistemic Hardening, which erases governance disputes to produce an objective historical fact. We show that this process induces epistemic vertigo and accountability gaps by offloading truth-resolution to off-platform communities such as Discord. Challenging narratives of frictionless collective intelligence, we demonstrate Epistemic Stratification, in which technical elites audit underlying mechanisms while the broader public consumes a sanitized, capital-weighted signal, and we conclude by advocating Friction-Positive Design that surfaces the social and financial frictions inherent in synthetic truth production.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Single-Multi Evolution Loop for Self-Improving Model Collaboration Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05182</link><description>arXiv:2602.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model collaboration -- systems where multiple language models (LMs) collaborate -- combines the strengths of diverse models with cost in loading multiple LMs. We improve efficiency while preserving the strengths of collaboration by distilling collaborative patterns into a single model, where the model is trained on the outputs of the model collaboration system. At inference time, only the distilled model is employed: it imitates the collaboration while only incurring the cost of a single model. Furthermore, we propose the single-multi evolution loop: multiple LMs collaborate, each distills from the collaborative outputs, and these post-distillation improved LMs collaborate again, forming a collective evolution ecosystem where models evolve and self-improve by interacting with an environment of other models. Extensive experiments with 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks (QA, reasoning, factuality, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) individual models improve by 8.0% on average, absorbing the strengths of collaboration while reducing the cost to a single model; 2) the collaboration also benefits from the stronger and more synergistic LMs after distillation, improving over initial systems without evolution by 14.9% on average. Analysis reveals that the single-multi evolution loop outperforms various existing evolutionary AI methods, is compatible with diverse model/collaboration/distillation settings, and helps solve problems where the initial model/system struggles to.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05182v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-Centric Interpretability for LLM-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05183</link><description>arXiv:2602.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained in complex Reinforcement Learning, multi-agent environments, making it difficult to understand how behavior changes over training. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05183v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Challenges in Solving Sequence-to-Graph Alignment with Co-Linear Structure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05186</link><description>arXiv:2602.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequence alignment is a cornerstone technique in computational biology for assessing similarities and differences among biological sequences. A key variant, sequence-to-graph alignment, plays a crucial role in effectively capturing genetic variations. In this work, we introduce two novel formulations within this framework: the Gap-Sensitive Co-Linear Chaining (Gap-CLC) problem and the Co-Linear Chaining with Errors based on Edit Distance (Edit-CLC) problem, and we investigate their computational complexity. We show that solving the Gap-CLC problem in sub-quadratic time is highly unlikely unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails -- even when restricted to binary alphabets. Furthermore, we establish that the Edit-CLC problem is NP-hard in the presence of errors within the graph. These findings emphasize that incorporating co-linear structures into sequence-to-graph alignment models fails to reduce computational complexity, highlighting that these models remain at least as computationally challenging to solve as those lacking such prior information.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are Open-Weight LLMs Ready for Social Media Moderation?

Abstract: As internet access expands, so does exposure to harmful content, increasing the need for effective moderation. Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.
  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals that specificity exceeds sensitivity for rudeness detection, but the opposite holds for intolerance and threats. Lastly, we identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and the LLMs, highlighting considerations for deploying LLMs in both platform-scale and personalized moderation contexts. These findings show open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware and suggest new directions for designing moderation systems that balance community values with individual user preferences.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05189v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PoseGaussian: Pose-Driven Novel View Synthesis for Robust 3D Human Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05190</link><description>arXiv:2602.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose PoseGaussian, a pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis. Human body pose serves a dual purpose in our design: as a structural prior, it is fused with a color encoder to refine depth estimation; as a temporal cue, it is processed by a dedicated pose encoder to enhance temporal consistency across frames. These components are integrated into a fully differentiable, end-to-end trainable pipeline. Unlike prior works that use pose only as a condition or for warping, PoseGaussian embeds pose signals into both geometric and temporal stages to improve robustness and generalization. It is specifically designed to address challenges inherent in dynamic human scenes, such as articulated motion and severe self-occlusion. Notably, our framework achieves real-time rendering at 100 FPS, maintaining the efficiency of standard Gaussian Splatting pipelines. We validate our approach on ZJU-MoCap, THuman2.0, and in-house datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and structural accuracy (PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, LPIPS 0.028).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05190v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Double-P: Hierarchical Top-P Sparse Attention for Long-Context LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05191</link><description>arXiv:2602.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As long-context inference becomes central to large language models (LLMs), attention over growing key-value caches emerges as a dominant decoding bottleneck, motivating sparse attention for scalable inference. Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05191v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Traceable Cross-Source RAG for Chinese Tibetan Medicine Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05195</link><description>arXiv:2602.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05195v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Informative Path Planning with Guaranteed Estimation Uncertainty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05198</link><description>arXiv:2602.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental monitoring robots often need to reconstruct spatial fields (e.g., salinity, temperature, bathymetry) under tight distance and energy constraints. Classical boustrophedon lawnmower surveys provide geometric coverage guarantees but can waste effort by oversampling predictable regions. In contrast, informative path planning (IPP) methods leverage spatial correlations to reduce oversampling, yet typically offer no guarantees on reconstruction quality. This paper bridges these approaches by addressing informative path planning with guaranteed estimation uncertainty: computing the shortest path whose measurements ensure that the Gaussian-process (GP) posterior variance -- an intrinsic uncertainty measure that lower-bounds the mean-squared prediction error under the GP model -- falls below a user-specified threshold over the monitoring region.
  We propose a three-stage approach: (i) learn a GP model from available prior information; (ii) transform the learned GP kernel into binary coverage maps for each candidate sensing location, indicating which locations' uncertainty can be reduced below a specified target; and (iii) plan a near-shortest route whose combined coverage satisfies the global uncertainty constraint. To address heterogeneous phenomena, we incorporate a nonstationary kernel that captures spatially varying correlation structure, and we accommodate non-convex environments with obstacles. Algorithmically, we present methods with provable approximation guarantees for sensing-location selection and for the joint selection-and-routing problem under a travel budget. Experiments on real-world topographic data show that our planners meet the uncertainty target using fewer sensing locations and shorter travel distances than a recent baseline, and field experiments with bathymetry-mapping autonomous surface and underwater vehicles demonstrate real-world feasibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05198v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FATe of Bots: Ethical Considerations of Social Bot Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05200</link><description>arXiv:2602.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing suite of research illustrates the negative impact of social media bots in amplifying harmful information with widespread social implications. Social bot detection algorithms have been developed to help identify these bot agents efficiently. While such algorithms can help mitigate the harmful effects of social media bots, they operate within complex socio-technical systems that include users and organizations. As such, ethical considerations are key while developing and deploying these bot detection algorithms, especially at scales as massive as social media ecosystems. In this article, we examine the ethical implications for social bot detection systems through three pillars: training datasets, algorithm development, and the use of bot agents. We do so by surveying the training datasets of existing bot detection algorithms, evaluating existing bot detection datasets, and drawing on discussions of user experiences of people being detected as bots. This examination is grounded in the FATe framework, which examines Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in consideration of tech ethics. We then elaborate on the challenges that researchers face in addressing ethical issues with bot detection and provide recommendations for research directions. We aim for this preliminary discussion to inspire more responsible and equitable approaches towards improving the social media bot detection landscape.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05200v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GT-SVJ: Generative-Transformer-Based Self-Supervised Video Judge For Efficient Video Reward Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05202</link><description>arXiv:2602.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning video generative models with human preferences remains challenging: current approaches rely on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling, but these models struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics. We propose a fundamentally different approach: repurposing video generative models, which are inherently designed to model temporal structure, as reward models. We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\times$ to $65\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05202v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Extreme Weather Nowcasting via Local Precipitation Pattern Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05204</link><description>arXiv:2602.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05204v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aligning Large Language Model Behavior with Human Citation Preferences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05205</link><description>arXiv:2602.05205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most services built on powerful large-scale language models (LLMs) add citations to their output to enhance credibility. Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains underexplored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with Direct Preference Optimization demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences. We expect this study to provide a foundation for more fine-grained investigations into LLM citation preferences.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05205v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantifying the Knowledge Proximity Between Academic and Industry Research: An Entity and Semantic Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05211</link><description>arXiv:2602.05211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The academia and industry are characterized by a reciprocal shaping and dynamic feedback mechanism. Despite distinct institutional logics, they have adapted closely in collaborative publishing and talent mobility, demonstrating tension between institutional divergence and intensive collaboration. Existing studies on their knowledge proximity mainly rely on macro indicators such as the number of collaborative papers or patents, lacking an analysis of knowledge units in the literature. This has led to an insufficient grasp of fine-grained knowledge proximity between industry and academia, potentially undermining collaboration frameworks and resource allocation efficiency. To remedy the limitation, this study quantifies the trajectory of academia-industry co-evolution through fine-grained entities and semantic space. In the entity measurement part, we extract fine-grained knowledge entities via pre-trained models, measure sequence overlaps using cosine similarity, and analyze topological features through complex network analysis. At the semantic level, we employ unsupervised contrastive learning to quantify convergence in semantic spaces by measuring cross-institutional textual similarities. Finally, we use citation distribution patterns to examine correlations between bidirectional knowledge flows and similarity. Analysis reveals that knowledge proximity between academia and industry rises, particularly following technological change. This provides textual evidence of bidirectional adaptation in co-evolution. Additionally, academia's knowledge dominance weakens during technological paradigm shifts.

Abstract: While recent neural codecs achieve strong performance at low bitrates when optimized for perceptual quality, their effectiveness deteriorates significantly under ultra-low bitrate conditions. To mitigate this, generative compression methods leveraging semantic priors from pretrained models have emerged as a promising paradigm. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism. Methods based on explicit representations preserve content structure but often lack fine-grained textures, whereas implicit methods can synthesize visually plausible details at the cost of semantic drift. In this work, we propose a unified framework that bridges this gap by coherently integrating explicit and implicit representations in a training-free manner. Specifically, We condition a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics while employing reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details. Moreover, we introduce a plug-in encoder that enables flexible control of the distortion-perception tradeoff by modulating the implicit information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods and surpassing DiffC by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on the Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05213v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Disentangled Representation Learning via Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05214</link><description>arXiv:2602.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to capture the underlying explanatory factors of observed data, enabling a principled understanding of the data-generating process. Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations. However, existing diffusion-based methods encourage factor independence via inductive biases, yet frequently lack strong semantic alignment. In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05214v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] E.M.Ground: A Temporal Grounding Vid-LLM with Holistic Event Perception and Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05215</link><description>arXiv:2602.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs), Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which aims to precisely localize time segments corresponding to query events, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often match start and end frames by comparing frame features with two separate tokens, relying heavily on exact timestamps. However, this approach fails to capture the event's semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities. To address this, we propose E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for TVG that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception. E.M.Ground introduces three key innovations: (i) a special  token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event, preserving semantic continuity for accurate event matching; (ii) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities across timestamps, improving prediction accuracy; (iii) multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and temporal understanding, compensating for compression-induced information loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that E.M.Ground consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs by significant margins.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05215v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semantic Search over 9 Million Mathematical Theorems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05216</link><description>arXiv:2602.05216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for mathematical results remains difficult: most existing tools retrieve entire papers, while mathematicians and theorem-proving agents often seek a specific theorem, lemma, or proposition that answers a query. While semantic search has seen rapid progress, its behavior on large, highly technical corpora such as research-level mathematical theorems remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over a unified corpus of $9.2$ million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems. We represent each theorem with a short natural-language description as a retrieval representation and systematically analyze how representation context, language model choice, embedding model, and prompting strategy affect retrieval quality. On a curated evaluation set of theorem-search queries written by professional mathematicians, our approach substantially improves both theorem-level and paper-level retrieval compared to existing baselines, demonstrating that semantic theorem search is feasible and effective at web scale.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation aims to segment categories in data-scarce domains conditioned on a few exemplars. Typical methods first establish few-shot capability in a large-scale source domain and then adapt it to target domains. However, due to the limited quantity and diversity of target samples, existing methods still exhibit constrained performance. Moreover, the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains, coupled with substantial domain gaps, severely hinders the effective utilization of target samples and further impedes adaptation. To this end, we propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which progressively adapts few-shot capability to target domains from both data and strategy perspectives. (i) From the data perspective, we introduce Hybrid Progressive Augmentation, which progressively generates more diverse and complex views through cumulative strong augmentations, thereby creating increasingly challenging learning scenarios. (ii) From the strategy perspective, we design Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction, which fully leverages these progressively complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths under extensive supervision. By jointly enforcing prediction consistency across diverse and complex views, MPA achieves both robust and accurate adaptation to target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPA effectively adapts few-shot capability to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05217v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Boosting SAM for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation via Conditional Point Sparsification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05218</link><description>arXiv:2602.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in promptable segmentation, recent studies leverage SAM to develop training-free solutions for few-shot segmentation, which aims to predict object masks in the target image based on a few reference exemplars. These SAM-based methods typically rely on point matching between reference and target images and use the matched dense points as prompts for mask prediction. However, we observe that dense points perform poorly in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), where target images are from medical or satellite domains. We attribute this issue to large domain shifts that disrupt the point-image interactions learned by SAM, and find that point density plays a crucial role under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars. Leveraging ground-truth masks, the reference images provide reliable guidance for adaptively sparsifying dense matched points, enabling more accurate segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05218v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Private Prediction via Shrinkage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05219</link><description>arXiv:2602.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study differentially private prediction introduced by Dwork and Feldman (COLT 2018): an algorithm receives one labeled sample set $S$ and then answers a stream of unlabeled queries while the output transcript remains $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private with respect to $S$. Standard composition yields a $\sqrt{T}$ dependence for $T$ queries.
  We show that this dependence can be reduced to polylogarithmic in $T$ in streaming settings. For an oblivious online adversary and any concept class $\mathcal{C}$, we give a private predictor that answers $T$ queries with $|S|= \tilde{O}(VC(\mathcal{C})^{3.5}\log^{3.5}T)$ labeled examples. For an adaptive online adversary and halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$, we obtain $|S|=\tilde{O}\left(d^{5.5}\log T\right)$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bagpiper: Solving Open-Ended Audio Tasks via Rich Captions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05220</link><description>arXiv:2602.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current audio foundation models typically rely on rigid, task-specific supervision, addressing isolated factors of audio rather than the whole. In contrast, human intelligence processes audio holistically, seamlessly bridging physical signals with abstract cognitive concepts to execute complex tasks. Grounded in this philosophy, we introduce Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions, i.e., comprehensive natural language descriptions that encapsulate the critical cognitive concepts inherent in the signal (e.g., transcription, audio events). By pre-training on a massive corpus of 600B tokens, the model establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and this high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, Bagpiper adopts a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step to solve diverse tasks without task-specific priors. Experimentally, Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpasses CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects. To the best of our knowledge, Bagpiper is among the first works that achieve unified understanding generation for general audio. Model, data, and code are available at Bagpiper Home Page.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05220v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Surgery: Mitigating Harmful Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Attention Sink</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05228</link><description>arXiv:2602.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Balanced Anomaly-guided Ego-graph Diffusion Model for Inductive Graph Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05232</link><description>arXiv:2602.05232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is crucial in applications like fraud detection and cybersecurity. Despite recent advancements using graph neural networks (GNNs), two major challenges persist. At the model level, most methods adopt a transductive learning paradigm, which assumes static graph structures, making them unsuitable for dynamic, evolving networks. At the data level, the extreme class imbalance, where anomalous nodes are rare, leads to biased models that fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. These challenges are interdependent: static transductive frameworks limit effective data augmentation, while imbalance exacerbates model distortion in inductive learning settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data-centric framework that integrates dynamic graph modeling with balanced anomaly synthesis. Our framework features: (1) a discrete ego-graph diffusion model, which captures the local topology of anomalies to generate ego-graphs aligned with anomalous structural distribution, and (2) a curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism, which dynamically adjusts synthetic data generation during training, focusing on underrepresented anomaly patterns to improve detection and generalization. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05232v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MobileManiBench: Simplifying Model Verification for Mobile Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05233</link><description>arXiv:2602.05233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language-action models have advanced robotic manipulation but remain constrained by reliance on the large, teleoperation-collected datasets dominated by the static, tabletop scenes. We propose a simulation-first framework to verify VLA architectures before real-world deployment and introduce MobileManiBench, a large-scale benchmark for mobile-based robotic manipulation. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim and powered by reinforcement learning, our pipeline autonomously generates diverse manipulation trajectories with rich annotations (language instructions, multi-view RGB-depth-segmentation images, synchronized object/robot states and actions). MobileManiBench features 2 mobile platforms (parallel-gripper and dexterous-hand robots), 2 synchronized cameras (head and right wrist), 630 objects in 20 categories, 5 skills (open, close, pull, push, pick) with over 100 tasks performed in 100 realistic scenes, yielding 300K trajectories. This design enables controlled, scalable studies of robot embodiments, sensing modalities, and policy architectures, accelerating research on data efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Intervention-based model steering offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative to prompting and fine-tuning. However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding generation in external knowledge to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Yet most deployments assume a centralized corpus, which is infeasible in privacy aware domains where knowledge remains siloed. This motivates federated RAG (FedRAG), where a central LLM server collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents. In context RAG violates this requirement by transmitting verbatim documents, whereas parametric RAG encodes documents into lightweight adapters that merge with a frozen LLM at inference, avoiding raw-text exchange. We adopt the parametric approach but face two unique challenges induced by FedRAG: high storage and communication from per-document adapters, and destructive aggregation caused by indiscriminately merging multiple adapters. We present FedMosaic, the first federated RAG framework built on parametric adapters. FedMosaic clusters semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks to reduce overhead while preserving specificity, and performs selective adapter aggregation to combine only relevance-aligned, nonconflicting adapters. Experiments show that FedMosaic achieves an average 10.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in four categories, while lowering storage costs by 78.8% to 86.3% and communication costs by 91.4%, and never sharing raw documents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05235v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PatchFlow: Leveraging a Flow-Based Model with Patch Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05238</link><description>arXiv:2602.05238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Die casting plays a crucial role across various industries due to its ability to craft intricate shapes with high precision and smooth surfaces. However, surface defects remain a major issue that impedes die casting quality control. Recently, computer vision techniques have been explored to automate and improve defect detection. In this work, we combine local neighbor-aware patch features with a normalizing flow model and bridge the gap between the generic pretrained feature extractor and industrial product images by introducing an adapter module to increase the efficiency and accuracy of automated anomaly detection. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach reduces the error rate by 20\% on the MVTec AD dataset, achieving an image-level AUROC of 99.28\%. Our approach has also enhanced performance on the VisA dataset , achieving an image-level AUROC of 96.48\%. Compared to the state-of-the-art models, this represents a 28.2\% reduction in error.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for brain tumour detection. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained on the BraTS 2021 dataset, achieving 91.24% accuracy in distinguishing between tumour and non-tumour regions. This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions. The integrated approach effectively explained model predictions, including cases with partial tumour visibility thus showing superior explanatory power compared to individual XAI methods. This research enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven medical imaging analysis by offering a more comprehensive perspective on the model's reasoning.

Abstract: Agentic Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has delivered state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex software engineering tasks such as code generation and bug fixing. However, its practical adoption remains limited due to significant computational overhead, primarily driven by two key challenges: (1) the high cost associated with deploying excessively large ensembles, and (2) the lack of a reliable mechanism for selecting the optimal candidate solution, ultimately constraining the performance gains that can be realized. To address these challenges, we propose Entropy-Guided Stepwise Scaling (EGSS), a novel TTS framework that dynamically balances efficiency and effectiveness through entropy-guided adaptive search and robust test-suite augmentation. Extensive experiments on SWE-Bench-Verified demonstrate that EGSS consistently boosts performance by 5-10% across all evaluated models. Specifically, it increases the resolved ratio of Kimi-K2-Intruct from 63.2% to 72.2%, and GLM-4.6 from 65.8% to 74.6%. Furthermore, when paired with GLM-4.6, EGSS achieves a new state-of-the-art among open-source large language models. In addition to these accuracy improvements, EGSS reduces inference-time token usage by over 28% compared to existing TTS methods, achieving simultaneous gains in both effectiveness and computational efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05242v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CORP: Closed-Form One-shot Representation-Preserving Structured Pruning for Vision Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05243</link><description>arXiv:2602.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers achieve strong accuracy but incur high compute and memory cost. Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05243v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automatic Cognitive Task Generation for In-Situ Evaluation of Embodied Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05249</link><description>arXiv:2602.05249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As general intelligent agents are poised for widespread deployment in diverse households, evaluation tailored to each unique unseen 3D environment has become a critical prerequisite. However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05249v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Active Label Cleaning for Reliable Detection of Electron Dense Deposits in Transmission Electron Microscopy Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05250</link><description>arXiv:2602.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated detection of electron dense deposits (EDD) in glomerular disease is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. While crowdsourcing reduces annotation cost, it introduces label noise. We propose an active label cleaning method to efficiently denoise crowdsourced datasets. Our approach uses active learning to select the most valuable noisy samples for expert re-annotation, building high-accuracy cleaning models. A Label Selection Module leverages discrepancies between crowdsourced labels and model predictions for both sample selection and instance-level noise grading. Experiments show our method achieves 67.18% AP\textsubscript{50} on a private dataset, an 18.83% improvement over training on noisy labels. This performance reaches 95.79% of that with full expert annotation while reducing annotation cost by 73.30%. The method provides a practical, cost-effective solution for developing reliable medical AI with limited expert resources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05250v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TADS: Task-Aware Data Selection for Multi-Task Multimodal Pre-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05251</link><description>arXiv:2602.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale multimodal pre-trained models like CLIP rely heavily on high-quality training data, yet raw web-crawled datasets are often noisy, misaligned, and redundant, leading to inefficient training and suboptimal generalization. Existing data selection methods are either heuristic-based, suffering from bias and limited diversity, or data-driven but task-agnostic, failing to optimize for multi-task scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce TADS (Task-Aware Data Selection), a novel framework for multi-task multimodal pre-training that integrates Intrinsic Quality, Task Relevance, and Distributional Diversity into a learnable value function. TADS employs a comprehensive quality assessment system with unimodal and cross-modal operators, quantifies task relevance via interpretable similarity vectors, and optimizes diversity through cluster-based weighting. A feedback-driven meta-learning mechanism adaptively refines the selection strategy based on proxy model performance across multiple downstream tasks. Experiments on CC12M demonstrate that TADS achieves superior zero-shot performance on benchmarks like ImageNet, CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K, using only 36% of the data while outperforming baselines by an average of 1.0%. This highlights that TADS significantly enhances data efficiency by curating a high-utility subset that yields a much higher performance ceiling within the same computational constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05251v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Copyright Detective: A Forensic System to Evidence LLMs Flickering Copyright Leakage Risks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05252</link><description>arXiv:2602.05252v1 Announce Type: new

It integrates multiple detection paradigms, including content recall testing, paraphrase-level similarity analysis, persuasive jailbreak probing, and unlearning verification, within a unified and extensible framework. Through interactive prompting, response collection, and iterative workflows, our system enables systematic auditing of verbatim memorization and paraphrase-level leakage, supporting responsible deployment and transparent evaluation of LLM copyright risks even with black-box access.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05252v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RFM-Pose:Reinforcement-Guided Flow Matching for Fast Category-Level 6D Pose Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05257</link><description>arXiv:2602.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and plays a critical role in virtual reality and embodied intelligence, where agents must understand and interact with objects in 3D space. Recently, score based generative models have to some extent solved the rotational symmetry ambiguity problem in category level pose estimation, but their efficiency remains limited by the high sampling cost of score-based diffusion. In this work, we propose a new framework, RFM-Pose, that accelerates category-level 6D object pose generation while actively evaluating sampled hypotheses. To improve sampling efficiency, we adopt a flow-matching generative model and generate pose candidates along an optimal transport path from a simple prior to the pose distribution. To further refine these candidates, we cast the flow-matching sampling process as a Markov decision process and apply proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy. In particular, we interpret the flow field as a learnable policy and map an estimator to a value network, enabling joint optimization of pose generation and hypothesis scoring within a reinforcement learning framework. Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark demonstrate that RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance while significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, similar to prior work, our approach can be readily adapted to object pose tracking and attains competitive results in this setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05257v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoPE: Clipped RoPE as A Scalable Free Lunch for Long Context LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05258</link><description>arXiv:2602.05258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization. Our code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/hrlics/CoPE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05258v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization: Revealing and Controlling Response Length Variation in RLVR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05261</link><description>arXiv:2602.05261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent applications of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance. Empirical results demonstrate that LUSPO represents a novel, state-of-the-art optimization strategy compared to existing methods such as GRPO and GSPO.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05261v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReGLA: Efficient Receptive-Field Modeling with Gated Linear Attention Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05262</link><description>arXiv:2602.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing accuracy and latency on high-resolution images is a critical challenge for lightweight models, particularly for Transformer-based architectures that often suffer from excessive latency. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ReGLA}, a series of lightweight hybrid networks, which integrates efficient convolutions for local feature extraction with ReLU-based gated linear attention for global modeling. The design incorporates three key innovations: the Efficient Large Receptive Field (ELRF) module for enhancing convolutional efficiency while preserving a large receptive field; the ReLU Gated Modulated Attention (RGMA) module for maintaining linear complexity while enhancing local feature representation; and a multi-teacher distillation strategy to boost performance on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ReGLA; particularly the ReGLA-M achieves \textbf{80.85\%} Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K at $224px$, with only \textbf{4.98 ms} latency at $512px$. Furthermore, ReGLA outperforms similarly scaled iFormer models in downstream tasks, achieving gains of \textbf{3.1\%} AP on COCO object detection and \textbf{3.6\%} mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, establishing it as a state-of-the-art solution for high-resolution visual applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05262v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nonlinear Predictive Cost Adaptive Control of Pseudo-Linear Input-Output Models Using Polynomial, Fourier, and Cubic Spline Observables</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05263</link><description>arXiv:2602.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of nonlinear systems with high levels of uncertainty is practically relevant and theoretically challenging. This paper presents a numerical investigation of an adaptive nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) technique that relies entirely on online system identification without prior modeling, training, or data collection. In particular, the paper considers predictive cost adaptive control (PCAC), which is an extension of generalized predictive control. Nonlinear PCAC (NPCAC) uses recursive least squares (RLS) with subspace of information forgetting (SIFt) to identify a discrete-time, pseudo-linear, input-output model, which is used with iterative MPC for nonlinear receding-horizon optimization. The performance of NPCAC is illustrated using polynomial, Fourier, and cubic-spline basis functions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05263v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Low-Cost Underwater In-Pipe Centering and Inspection Using a Minimal-Sensing Robot</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05265</link><description>arXiv:2602.05265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater inspection of submerged pipelines is challenging due to confined geometries, turbidity, and the scarcity of reliable localization cues. This paper presents a minimal-sensing strategy that enables a free-swimming underwater robot to center itself and traverse a flooded pipe of known radius using only an IMU, a pressure sensor, and two sonars: a downward-facing single-beam sonar and a rotating 360 degree sonar. We introduce a computationally efficient method for extracting range estimates from single-beam sonar intensity data, enabling reliable wall detection in noisy and reverberant conditions. A closed-form geometric model leverages the two sonar ranges to estimate the pipe center, and an adaptive, confidence-weighted proportional-derivative (PD) controller maintains alignment during traversal. The system requires no Doppler velocity log, external tracking, or complex multi-sensor arrays. Experiments in a submerged 46 cm-diameter pipe using a Blue Robotics BlueROV2 heavy remotely operated vehicle demonstrate stable centering and successful full-pipe traversal despite ambient flow and structural deformations. These results show that reliable in-pipe navigation and inspection can be achieved with a lightweight, computationally efficient sensing and processing architecture, advancing the practicality of autonomous underwater inspection in confined environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05265v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Cosine Similarity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05266</link><description>arXiv:2602.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF): Stabilizing 1.58-bit LLMs via Selective Low-Rank Correction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05269</link><description>arXiv:2602.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" -- a hardware limitation where memory bandwidth, not compute, becomes the bottleneck. Recent 1.58-bit quantization techniques (e.g., BitNet b1.58) dramatically reduce memory footprint but typically incur a perplexity degradation of 20-25% compared to FP16 baselines. In this work, we introduce Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), a dual-stream architecture that couples a 1.58-bit ternary backbone with a learnable, low-rank FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates.
  Through extensive experiments on the TinyStories dataset across two training regimes (2500 and 3500 steps), we demonstrate that HGF 5.4 achieves a validation loss of 0.9306 compared to BitNet's 1.0294, recovering approximately 55% of the quality gap between pure ternary quantization and the FP16 baseline (0.8490). This recovery is achieved with only ~12-15% memory overhead beyond the ternary backbone.
  Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence for an emergent phenomenon: quantization as structural regularization. While a full-precision differential attention baseline (Diff_Only) exhibited training instability with validation loss exceeding 1.68, the ternary-anchored HGF maintained robust convergence throughout training. Finally, we report preliminary results extending this architecture to 1.2B and 3B parameter models trained on SlimPajama and FineWeb-Edu. These larger-scale experiments confirm that the architectural stability and quality recovery observed in small-scale proxies scale linearly to production-grade language modeling regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05269v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PatchGuru: Patch Oracle Inference from Natural Language Artifacts with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05270</link><description>arXiv:2602.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As software systems evolve, patches may unintentionally alter program behavior. Validating patches against their intended semantics is difficult due to incomplete regression tests and informal, non-executable natural language (NL) descriptions of patch intent. We present PatchGuru, the first automated technique that infers executable patch specifications from real-world pull requests (PRs). Given a PR, PatchGuru uses large language models (LLMs) to extract developer intent from NL artifacts and synthesizes patch oracles: under-approximate yet practical specifications expressed as runtime assertions in comparison programs that integrate pre- and post-patch versions. Patch oracles focus on patch-relevant behaviors, enable automated validation, and support cross-version properties. PatchGuru iteratively refines inferred oracles by comparing pre- and post-patch behaviors, identifies violations, filters inconsistencies via self-review, and generates bug reports. We evaluate PatchGuru on 400 recent PRs from four widely used open-source Python projects. PatchGuru reports 39 warnings with a precision of 0.62, yielding 24 confirmed true positives, including 12 previously unknown bugs, 11 of which were subsequently fixed by developers. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique Testora, PatchGuru detects 17 more bugs (24 vs. 7) while improving precision from 0.32 to 0.62. PatchGuru incurs an average cost of 8.9 minutes and USD 0.07 per PR. These results suggest that PatchGuru complements code review and regression testing by providing executable documentation and automated validation of patch intent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05270v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unlocking Prototype Potential: An Efficient Tuning Framework for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05271</link><description>arXiv:2602.05271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) seeks to continuously learn new classes from very limited samples while preserving previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods often utilize a frozen pre-trained feature extractor to generate static class prototypes, which suffer from the inherent representation bias of the backbone. While recent prompt-based tuning methods attempt to adapt the backbone via minimal parameter updates, given the constraint of extreme data scarcity, the model's capacity to assimilate novel information and substantively enhance its global discriminative power is inherently limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shift in perspective: freezing the feature extractor while fine-tuning the prototypes. We argue that the primary challenge in FSCIL is not feature acquisition, but rather the optimization of decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space. To this end, we introduce an efficient prototype fine-tuning framework that evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets. These components function synergistically to improve the discriminative capacity of prototypes for ongoing incremental classes. Extensive results demonstrate that our method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05271v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Affordance-Aware Interactive Decision-Making and Execution for Ambiguous Instructions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05273</link><description>arXiv:2602.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling robots to explore and act in unfamiliar environments under ambiguous human instructions by interactively identifying task-relevant objects (e.g., identifying cups or beverages for "I'm thirsty") remains challenging for existing vision-language model (VLM)-based methods. This challenge stems from inefficient reasoning and the lack of environmental interaction, which hinder real-time task planning and execution. To address this, We propose Affordance-Aware Interactive Decision-Making and Execution for Ambiguous Instructions (AIDE), a dual-stream framework that integrates interactive exploration with vision-language reasoning, where Multi-Stage Inference (MSI) serves as the decision-making stream and Accelerated Decision-Making (ADM) as the execution stream, enabling zero-shot affordance analysis and interpretation of ambiguous instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments show that AIDE achieves the task planning success rate of over 80\% and more than 95\% accuracy in closed-loop continuous execution at 10 Hz, outperforming existing VLM-based methods in diverse open-world scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05273v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Magic-MM-Embedding: Towards Visual-Token-Efficient Universal Multimodal Embedding with MLLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05275</link><description>arXiv:2602.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown immense promise in universal multimodal retrieval, which aims to find relevant items of various modalities for a given query. But their practical application is often hindered by the substantial computational cost incurred from processing a large number of tokens from visual inputs. In this paper, we propose Magic-MM-Embedding, a series of novel models that achieve both high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in universal multimodal embedding. Our approach is built on two synergistic pillars: (1) a highly efficient MLLM architecture incorporating visual token compression to drastically reduce inference latency and memory footprint, and (2) a multi-stage progressive training strategy designed to not only recover but significantly boost performance. This coarse-to-fine training paradigm begins with extensive continue pretraining to restore multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, progresses to large-scale contrastive pretraining and hard negative mining to enhance discriminative power, and culminates in a task-aware fine-tuning stage guided by an MLLM-as-a-Judge for precise data curation. Comprehensive experiments show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin while being more inference-efficient.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05275v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hallucination-Resistant Security Planning with a Large Language Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05279</link><description>arXiv:2602.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05279v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Online Learning of Safe Regions in Cloud Radio Access Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05280</link><description>arXiv:2602.05280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud radio access networks (RANs) enable cost-effective management of mobile networks by dynamically scaling their capacity on demand. However, deploying adaptive controllers to implement such dynamic scaling in operational networks is challenging due to the risk of breaching service agreements and operational constraints. To mitigate this challenge, we present a novel method for learning the safe operating region of the RAN, i.e., the set of resource allocations and network configurations for which its specification is fulfilled. The method, which we call (C)ausal (O)nline (L)earning, operates in two online phases: an inference phase and an intervention phase. In the first phase, we passively observe the RAN to infer an initial safe region via causal inference and Gaussian process regression. In the second phase, we gradually expand this region through interventional Bayesian learning. We prove that COL ensures that the learned region is safe with a specified probability and that it converges to the full safe region under standard conditions. We experimentally validate COL on a 5G testbed. The results show that COL quickly learns the safe region while incurring low operational cost and being up to 10x more sample-efficient than current state-of-the-art methods for safe learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05280v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Back to Basics: Revisiting Exploration in Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning via Generative Probabilities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05281</link><description>arXiv:2602.05281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05281v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Inference-Time Steering of Protein Diffusion Models via Embedding Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05285</link><description>arXiv:2602.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many biophysical inverse problems, the goal is to generate biomolecular conformations that are both physically plausible and consistent with experimental measurements. As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Position: Universal Time Series Foundation Models Rest on a Category Error</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05287</link><description>arXiv:2602.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05287v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards a Science of Collective AI: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems Need a Transition from Blind Trial-and-Error to Rigorous Science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05289</link><description>arXiv:2602.05289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly extended the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), demonstrating significant effectiveness across a wide range of complex and open-ended domains. However, despite this rapid progress, the field still relies heavily on empirical trial-and-error. It lacks a unified and principled scientific framework necessary for systematic optimization and improvement. This bottleneck stems from the ambiguity of attribution: first, the absence of a structured taxonomy of factors leaves researchers restricted to unguided adjustments; second, the lack of a unified metric fails to distinguish genuine collaboration gain from mere resource accumulation. In this paper, we advocate for a transition to design science through an integrated framework. We advocate to establish the collaboration gain metric ($\Gamma$) as the scientific standard to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets. Leveraging $\Gamma$, we propose a factor attribution paradigm to systematically identify collaboration-driving factors. To support this, we construct a systematic MAS factor library, structuring the design space into control-level presets and information-level dynamics. Ultimately, this framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05289v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ORACL: Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05292</link><description>arXiv:2602.05292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications are moving away from monolithic designs to microservice and serverless architectures, where fleets of lightweight and independently deployable components run on public clouds. Autoscaling serves as the primary control mechanism for balancing resource utilization and quality of service, yet existing policies are either opaque learned models that require substantial per-deployment training or brittle hand-tuned rules that fail to generalize. We investigate whether large language models can act as universal few-shot resource allocators that adapt across rapidly evolving microservice deployments.
  We propose ORACL, Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices, a framework that leverages prior knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning to diagnose performance regressions and recommend resource allocations. ORACL transforms runtime telemetry, including pods, replicas, CPU and memory usage, latency, service-level objectives, and fault signals, into semantic natural-language state descriptions and invokes an LLM to produce an interpretable intermediate reasoning trace. This reasoning identifies likely root causes, prunes the action space, and issues safe allocation decisions under policy constraints. Experiments on representative open-source microservice workloads show that ORACL improves root-cause identification accuracy by 15 percent, accelerates training by up to 24x, and improves quality of service by 6 percent in short-term scenarios, without deployment-specific retraining.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05292v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast-SAM3D: 3Dfy Anything in Images but Faster</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05293</link><description>arXiv:2602.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SAM3D enables scalable, open-world 3D reconstruction from complex scenes, yet its deployment is hindered by prohibitive inference latency. In this work, we conduct the \textbf{first systematic investigation} into its inference dynamics, revealing that generic acceleration strategies are brittle in this context. We demonstrate that these failures stem from neglecting the pipeline's inherent multi-level \textbf{heterogeneity}: the kinematic distinctiveness between shape and layout, the intrinsic sparsity of texture refinement, and the spectral variance across geometries. To address this, we present \textbf{Fast-SAM3D}, a training-free framework that dynamically aligns computation with instantaneous generation complexity. Our approach integrates three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: (1) \textit{Modality-Aware Step Caching} to decouple structural evolution from sensitive layout updates; (2) \textit{Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving} to concentrate refinement on high-entropy regions; and (3) \textit{Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation} to adapt decoding resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fast-SAM3D delivers up to \textbf{2.67$\times$} end-to-end speedup with negligible fidelity loss, establishing a new Pareto frontier for efficient single-view 3D generation.

Abstract: In this work, we present a memory-efficient, high-performance GPU framework for moment-based lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) with fluid-solid coupling. We introduce a split-kernel scheme that decouples fluid updates from solid boundary handling, substantially reducing warp divergence and improving utilization on GPUs. We further perform the first von Neumann stability analysis of the high-order moment-encoded LBM (HOME-LBM) formulation, characterizing its spectral behavior and deriving stability bounds for individual moment components. These theoretical insights directly guide a practical 16-bit moment quantization without compromising numerical stability. Our framework achieves up to 6x speedup and reduces GPU memory footprint by up to 50% in fluid-only scenarios and 25% in scenes with complex solid boundaries compared to the state-of-the-art LBM solver, while preserving physical fidelity across a range of large-scale benchmarks and real-time demonstrations. The proposed approach enables scalable, stable, and high-resolution LBM simulation on a single GPU, bridging theoretical stability analysis with practical GPU algorithm design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aspect-Aware MOOC Recommendation in a Heterogeneous Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05297</link><description>arXiv:2602.05297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MOOC recommendation systems have received increasing attention to help learners navigate and select preferred learning content. Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05297v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Co-Designing Collaborative Generative AI Tools for Freelancers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05299</link><description>arXiv:2602.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most generative AI tools prioritize individual productivity and personalization, with limited support for collaboration. Designed for traditional workplaces, these tools do not fit freelancers' short-term teams or lack of shared institutional support, which can worsen their isolation and overlook freelancing platform dynamics. This mismatch means that, instead of empowering freelancers, current generative AI tools could reinforce existing precarity and make freelancer collaboration harder. To investigate how to design generative AI tools to support freelancer collaboration, we conducted co-design sessions with 27 freelancers. A key concern that emerged was the risk of AI systems compromising their creative agency and work identities when collaborating, especially when AI tools could reproduce content without attribution, threatening the authenticity and distinctiveness of their collaborative work. Freelancers proposed "auxiliary AI" systems, human-guided tools that support their creative agencies and identities, allowing for flexible freelancer-led collaborations that promote "productive friction". Drawing on Marcuse's concept of technological rationality, we argue that freelancers are resisting one-dimensional, efficiency-driven AI, and instead envisioning technologies that preserve their collective creative agencies. We conclude with design recommendations for collaborative generative AI tools for freelancers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05299v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PieArena: Frontier Language Agents Achieve MBA-Level Negotiation Performance and Reveal Novel Behavioral Differences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05302</link><description>arXiv:2602.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' ability to negotiate, a central business task that requires strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation. To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05302v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Short and Unified Convergence Analysis of the SAG, SAGA, and IAG Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05304</link><description>arXiv:2602.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic variance-reduced algorithms such as Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) and SAGA, and their deterministic counterparts like the Incremental Aggregated Gradient (IAG) method, have been extensively studied in large-scale machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05304v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlashBlock: Attention Caching for Efficient Long-Context Block Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05305</link><description>arXiv:2602.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating long-form content, such as minute-long videos and extended texts, is increasingly important for modern generative models. Block diffusion improves inference efficiency via KV caching and block-wise causal inference and has been widely adopted in diffusion language models and video generation. However, in long-context settings, block diffusion still incurs substantial overhead from repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache. We identify an underexplored property of block diffusion: cross-step redundancy of attention within a block. Our analysis shows that attention outputs from tokens outside the current block remain largely stable across diffusion steps, while block-internal attention varies significantly. Based on this observation, we propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output, reducing attention computation and KV cache access without modifying the diffusion process. Moreover, FlashBlock is orthogonal to sparse attention and can be combined as a complementary residual reuse strategy, substantially improving model accuracy under aggressive sparsification. Experiments on diffusion language models and video generation demonstrate up to 1.44$\times$ higher token throughput and up to 1.6$\times$ reduction in attention time, with negligible impact on generation quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by producing long chains of thought, but their inference costs are high and often generate redundant reasoning. Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration. Our results show that selective inference-time guidance restores large-model reasoning ability without substantial inference overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05307v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Soccer Skills for Humanoid Robots: A Progressive Perception-Action Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05310</link><description>arXiv:2602.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soccer presents a significant challenge for humanoid robots, demanding tightly integrated perception-action capabilities for tasks like perception-guided kicking and whole-body balance control. Existing approaches suffer from inter-module instability in modular pipelines or conflicting training objectives in end-to-end frameworks. We propose Perception-Action integrated Decision-making (PAiD), a progressive architecture that decomposes soccer skill acquisition into three stages: motion-skill acquisition via human motion tracking, lightweight perception-action integration for positional generalization, and physics-aware sim-to-real transfer. This staged decomposition establishes stable foundational skills, avoids reward conflicts during perception integration, and minimizes sim-to-real gaps. Experiments on the Unitree G1 demonstrate high-fidelity human-like kicking with robust performance under diverse conditions-including static or rolling balls, various positions, and disturbances-while maintaining consistent execution across indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our divide-and-conquer strategy advances robust humanoid soccer capabilities and offers a scalable framework for complex embodied skill acquisition.

Abstract: Fuzzing has become a popular technique for automatically detecting vulnerabilities and bugs by generating unexpected inputs. In recent years, the fuzzing process has been integrated into continuous integration workflows (i.e., continuous fuzzing), enabling short and frequent testing cycles. Despite its widespread adoption, prior research has not examined whether the effectiveness of continuous fuzzing varies across programming languages. This study conducts a large-scale cross-language analysis to examine how fuzzing bug characteristics and detection efficiency differ among languages. We analyze 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects categorized by primary language. Our findings reveal that (i) C++ and Rust exhibit higher fuzzing bug detection frequencies, (ii) Rust and Python show low vulnerability ratios but tend to expose more critical vulnerabilities, (iii) crash types vary across languages and unreproducible bugs are more frequent in Go but rare in Rust, and (iv) Python attains higher patch coverage but suffers from longer time-to-detection. These results demonstrate that fuzzing behavior and effectiveness are strongly shaped by language design, providing insights for language-aware fuzzing strategies and tool development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05312v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Reachability Problem for One-Dimensional Thin Grammar Vector Addition Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05315</link><description>arXiv:2602.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector addition systems with states (VASS) are a classic model in concurrency theory. Grammar vector addition systems (GVAS), equivalently, pushdown VASS, extend VASS by using a context-free grammar to control addition. In this paper, our main focus is on the reachability problem for one-dimensional thin GVAS (thin 1-GVAS), a structurally restricted yet expressive subclass. By adopting the index measure for complexity, and by generalizing the decomposition technique developed in the study of VASS reachability to grammar-generated derivation trees of GVAS, an effective integer programming system is established for a thin 1-GVAS. In this way, a nondeterministic algorithm with $\mathbf{F}_{2k}$ complexity is obtained for the reachability of thin 1-GVAS with index $k$, yielding a tighter upper bound than the previous one.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05315v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accelerated Sequential Flow Matching: A Bayesian Filtering Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05319</link><description>arXiv:2602.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential prediction from streaming observations is a fundamental problem in stochastic dynamical systems, where inherent uncertainty often leads to multiple plausible futures. While diffusion and flow-matching models are capable of modeling complex, multi-modal trajectories, their deployment in real-time streaming environments typically relies on repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, incurring substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs. In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to na\"ive re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling. It suggests that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a new and principled perspective towards efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05319v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wid3R: Wide Field-of-View 3D Reconstruction via Camera Model Conditioning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05321</link><description>arXiv:2602.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Wid3R, a feed-forward neural network for visual geometry reconstruction that supports wide field-of-view camera models. Prior methods typically assume that input images are rectified or captured with pinhole cameras, since both their architectures and training datasets are tailored to perspective images only. These assumptions limit their applicability in real-world scenarios that use fisheye or panoramic cameras and often require careful calibration and undistortion. In contrast, Wid3R is a generalizable multi-view 3D estimation method that can model wide field-of-view camera types. Our approach leverages a ray representation with spherical harmonics and a novel camera model token within the network, enabling distortion-aware 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, Wid3R is the first multi-view foundation model to support feed-forward 3D reconstruction directly from 360 imagery. It demonstrates strong zero-shot robustness and consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to +77.33 on Stanford2D3D.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05321v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GAS: Enhancing Reward-Cost Balance of Generative Model-assisted Offline Safe RL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05323</link><description>arXiv:2602.05323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) aims to learn a policy to achieve high performance in sequential decision-making while satisfying constraints, using only pre-collected datasets. Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to "stitch" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05323v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Data Driven Structural Decomposition of Dynamic Games via Best Response Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05324</link><description>arXiv:2602.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic games are powerful tools to model multi-agent decision-making, yet computing Nash (generalized Nash) equilibria remains a central challenge in such settings. Complexity arises from tightly coupled optimality conditions, nested optimization structures, and poor numerical conditioning. Existing game-theoretic solvers address these challenges by directly solving the joint game, typically requiring explicit modeling of all agents' objective functions and constraints, while learning-based approaches often decouple interaction through prediction or policy approximation, sacrificing equilibrium consistency. This paper introduces a conceptually novel formulation for dynamic games by restructuring the equilibrium computation. Rather than solving a fully coupled game or decoupling agents through prediction or policy approximation, a data-driven structural reduction of the game is proposed that removes nested optimization layers and derivative coupling by embedding an offline-compiled best-response map as a feasibility constraint. Under standard regularity conditions, when the best-response operator is exact, any converged solution of the reduced problem corresponds to a local open-loop Nash (GNE) equilibrium of the original game; with a learned surrogate, the solution is approximately equilibrium-consistent up to the best-response approximation error. The proposed formulation is supported by mathematical proofs, accompanying a large-scale Monte Carlo study in a two-player open-loop dynamic game motivated by the autonomous racing problem. Comparisons are made against state-of-the-art joint game solvers, and results are reported on solution quality, computational cost, and constraint satisfaction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RoboPaint: From Human Demonstration to Any Robot and Any View</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05325</link><description>arXiv:2602.05325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring large-scale, high-fidelity robot demonstration data remains a critical bottleneck for scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in dexterous manipulation. We propose a Real-Sim-Real data collection and data editing pipeline that transforms human demonstrations into robot-executable, environment-specific training data without direct robot teleoperation. Standardized data collection rooms are built to capture multimodal human demonstrations (synchronized 3 RGB-D videos, 11 RGB videos, 29-DoF glove joint angles, and 14-channel tactile signals). Based on these human demonstrations, we introduce a tactile-aware retargeting method that maps human hand states to robot dex-hand states via geometry and force-guided optimization. Then the retargeted robot trajectories are rendered in a photorealistic Isaac Sim environment to build robot training data. Real world experiments have demonstrated: (1) The retargeted dex-hand trajectories achieve an 84\% success rate across 10 diverse object manipulation tasks. (2) VLA policies (Pi0.5) trained exclusively on our generated data achieve 80\% average success rate on three representative tasks, i.e., pick-and-place, pushing and pouring. To conclude, robot training data can be efficiently "painted" from human demonstrations using our real-sim-real data pipeline. We offer a scalable, cost-effective alternative to teleoperation with minimal performance loss for complex dexterous manipulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05325v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProAct: Agentic Lookahead in Interactive Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05327</link><description>arXiv:2602.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle in interactive environments requiring long-horizon planning, primarily due to compounding errors when simulating future states. To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

Many organizations have built their security knowledge bases to safeguard against attacks and vulnerabilities. However, due to the time lag in the official release of security information, these security knowledge bases may not be well maintained, and using them to protect software systems against emergent security risks can be challenging. On the other hand, the security posts on online knowledge-sharing platforms contain many crowd security discussions and the knowledge in those posts can be used to enhance the security knowledge bases. This paper proposes SynAT, an automatic approach to synthesize attack trees from crowd security posts. Given a security post, SynAT first utilize the Large Language Model (LLM) and prompt learning to restrict the scope of sentences that may contain attack information; then it utilizes a transition-based event and relation extraction model to extract the events and relations simultaneously from the scope; finally, it applies heuristic rules to synthesize the attack trees with the extracted events and relations. An experimental evaluation is conducted on 5,070 Stack Overflow security posts, and the results show that SynAT outperforms all baselines in both event and relation extraction, and achieves the highest tree similarity in attack tree synthesis. Furthermore, SynAT has been applied to enhance HUAWEI's security knowledge base as well as public security knowledge bases CVE and CAPEC, which demonstrates SynAT's practicality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05329v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MTPano: Multi-Task Panoramic Scene Understanding via Label-Free Integration of Dense Prediction Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05330</link><description>arXiv:2602.05330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehensive panoramic scene understanding is critical for immersive applications, yet it remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-resolution, multi-task annotations. While perspective foundation models have achieved success through data scaling, directly adapting them to the panoramic domain often fails due to severe geometric distortions and coordinate system discrepancies. Furthermore, the underlying relations between diverse dense prediction tasks in spherical spaces are underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose MTPano, a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model established by a label-free training pipeline. First, to circumvent data scarcity, we leverage powerful perspective dense priors. We project panoramic images into perspective patches to generate accurate, domain-gap-free pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf foundation models, which are then re-projected to serve as patch-wise supervision. Second, to tackle the interference between task types, we categorize tasks into rotation-invariant (e.g., depth, segmentation) and rotation-variant (e.g., surface normals) groups. We introduce the Panoramic Dual BridgeNet, which disentangles these feature streams via geometry-aware modulation layers that inject absolute position and ray direction priors. To handle the distortion from equirectangular projections (ERP), we incorporate ERP token mixers followed by a dual-branch BridgeNet for interactions with gradient truncation, facilitating beneficial cross-task information sharing while blocking conflicting gradients from incompatible task attributes. Additionally, we introduce auxiliary tasks (image gradient, point map, etc.) to fertilize the cross-task learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTPano achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and delivers competitive results against task-specific panoramic specialist foundation models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05330v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pool-based Active Learning as Noisy Lossy Compression: Characterizing Label Complexity via Finite Blocklength Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05333</link><description>arXiv:2602.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the theoretical limits of pool-based active learning (AL), in which a subset of instances is selectively labeled. The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05333v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NeuCLIRTech: Chinese Monolingual and Cross-Language Information Retrieval Evaluation in a Challenging Domain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05334</link><description>arXiv:2602.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring advances in retrieval requires test collections with relevance judgments that can faithfully distinguish systems. This paper presents NeuCLIRTech, an evaluation collection for cross-language retrieval over technical information. The collection consists of technical documents written natively in Chinese and those same documents machine translated into English. It includes 110 queries with relevance judgments. The collection supports two retrieval scenarios: monolingual retrieval in Chinese, and cross-language retrieval with English as the query language. NeuCLIRTech combines the TREC NeuCLIR track topics of 2023 and 2024. The 110 queries with 35,962 document judgments provide strong statistical discriminatory power when trying to distinguish retrieval approaches. A fusion baseline of strong neural retrieval systems is included so that developers of reranking algorithms are not reliant on BM25 as their first stage retriever.

Abstract: With the increasing versatility of text-to-image diffusion models, the ability to selectively erase undesirable concepts (e.g., harmful content) has become indispensable. However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs. We first generate safe counterparts from unsafe inputs while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data. Leveraging these pairs, we introduce two key components: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment, a guided objective that uses unsafe-safe pairs to explicitly map target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors; and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA, which initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs, encouraging the generation of safe alternatives while selectively suppressing unsafe concepts. Together, these components enable fine-grained erasure that removes only the targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05339v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wi-Fi Radar via Over-the-Air Referencing: Bridging Wi-Fi Sensing and Bistatic Radar</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05344</link><description>arXiv:2602.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has attracted significant attention for human sensing and related applications. However, unsynchronized transmitters and receivers fundamentally preclude phase-coherent radar-like delay--Doppler analysis. By exploiting the line-of-sight (LoS) path, i.e., the earliest-arriving direct path, as an over-the-air (OTA) reference for delay and phase, we propose an OTA LoS-path referencing scheme, termed LoSRef, that enables delay calibration and phase alignment in unsynchronized Wi-Fi systems. Unlike conventional Wi-Fi bistatic radar systems that rely on wired reference signals or dedicated reference antennas, the proposed LoSRef-based framework bridges the long-standing gap between conventional Wi-Fi sensing and Wi-Fi radar, enabling phase-coherent bistatic radar-like operation in a drop-in Wi-Fi sensing configuration. Through human gait and respiration experiments in indoor environments, we demonstrate that phase-coherent channel impulse responses and corresponding delay--Doppler responses are obtained using only commodity Wi-Fi devices. This enables physically interpretable human motion sensing, including gait-induced range variation and respiration-induced sub-wavelength displacement, as well as the extraction of target-induced dynamics up to 20 dB weaker than dominant static multipath components.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05344v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning with Adaptive Prototype Manifolds for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05349</link><description>arXiv:2602.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. Existing prototype-based representation learning methods have demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of our method, where APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05349v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smoothness Errors in Dynamics Models and How to Avoid Them</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05352</link><description>arXiv:2602.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern neural networks have shown promise for solving partial differential equations over surfaces, often by discretizing the surface as a mesh and learning with a mesh-aware graph neural network. However, graph neural networks suffer from oversmoothing, where a node's features become increasingly similar to those of its neighbors. Unitary graph convolutions, which are mathematically constrained to preserve smoothness, have been proposed to address this issue. Despite this, in many physical systems, such as diffusion processes, smoothness naturally increases and unitarity may be overconstraining. In this paper, we systematically study the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling and prove that unitary convolutions hurt performance for such tasks. We propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with the natural smoothing required for physical systems. We also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes. In experiments on PDEs such as the heat and wave equations over complex meshes and on weather forecasting, we find that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgentXRay: White-Boxing Agentic Systems via Workflow Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05353</link><description>arXiv:2602.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05353v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PATHWAYS: Evaluating Investigation and Context Discovery in AI Web Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05354</link><description>arXiv:2602.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 multi-step decision tasks that test whether web-based agents can discover and correctly use hidden contextual information. Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05354v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Neighborhood Adaptation for Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05358</link><description>arXiv:2602.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05358v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Latent Reasoning via Hierarchical Visual Cues Injection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05359</link><description>arXiv:2602.05359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has enabled impressive perception capabilities. However, their reasoning process often remains a "fast thinking" paradigm, reliant on end-to-end generation or explicit, language-centric chains of thought (CoT), which can be inefficient, verbose, and prone to hallucination. This work posits that robust reasoning should evolve within a latent space, integrating multimodal signals seamlessly. We propose multimodal latent reasoning via HIerarchical Visual cuEs injection (\emph{HIVE}), a novel framework that instills deliberate, "slow thinking" without depending on superficial textual rationales. Our method recursively extends transformer blocks, creating an internal loop for iterative reasoning refinement. Crucially, it injectively grounds this process with hierarchical visual cues from global scene context to fine-grained regional details directly into the model's latent representations. This enables the model to perform grounded, multi-step inference entirely in the aligned latent space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that test-time scaling is effective when incorporating vision knowledge, and that integrating hierarchical information significantly enhances the model's understanding of complex scenes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking Semantic Hegemony: Decoupling Principal and Residual Subspaces for Generalized OOD Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05360</link><description>arXiv:2602.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While feature-based post-hoc methods have made significant strides in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, we uncover a counter-intuitive Simplicity Paradox in existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models: these models exhibit keen sensitivity in distinguishing semantically subtle OOD samples but suffer from severe Geometric Blindness when confronting structurally distinct yet semantically simple samples or high-frequency sensor noise. We attribute this phenomenon to Semantic Hegemony within the deep feature space and reveal its mathematical essence through the lens of Neural Collapse. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the spectral concentration bias, induced by the high variance of the principal subspace, numerically masks the structural distribution shift signals that should be significant in the residual subspace. To address this issue, we propose D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework. This method utilizes orthogonal decomposition to explicitly separate semantic components from structural residuals and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism to reactivate the model's sensitivity to weak residual signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-KNN effectively breaks Semantic Hegemony, establishing new SOTA performance on both CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks. Notably, in resolving the Simplicity Paradox, it reduces the FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3%; when addressing sensor failures such as Gaussian noise, it boosts the detection performance (AUROC) from a baseline of 79.7% to 94.9%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05360v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Imagine a City: CityGenAgent for Procedural 3D City Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05362</link><description>arXiv:2602.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automated generation of interactive 3D cities is a critical challenge with broad applications in autonomous driving, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence. While recent advances in generative models and procedural techniques have improved the realism of city generation, existing methods often struggle with high-fidelity asset creation, controllability, and manipulation. In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program. To ensure structural correctness and semantic alignment, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We train BlockGen and BuildingGen to generate valid programs that adhere to schema constraints, including non-self-intersecting polygons and complete fields; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL). We design Spatial Alignment Reward to enhance spatial reasoning ability and Visual Consistency Reward to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and the visual modality. Benefiting from the programs and the models' generalization, CityGenAgent supports natural language editing and manipulation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability compared to existing methods, establishing a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05362v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Policy-Driven Orchestration Framework for Multi-Operator Non-Terrestrial Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05363</link><description>arXiv:2602.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) have gained significant attention for their scalability and wide coverage in next-generation communication systems. A large number of NTN nodes, such as satellites, are required to establish a global NTN, but not all operators have the capability to deploy such a system. Therefore, cooperation among multiple operators, facilitated by an orchestrator, enables the construction of virtually large-scale constellations. In this paper, we propose a weak-control-based orchestration framework that coordinates multiple NTN operators while ensuring that operations align with the policies of both the orchestrator and the individual operators. Unlike centralized orchestration frameworks, where the orchestrator determines the entire route from source to destination, the proposed framework allows each operator to select preferred routes from multiple candidates provided by the orchestrator. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted numerical simulations under various scenarios and network configurations including dynamic NTN environments with time-varying topologies, showing that inter-operator cooperation improves the availability of feasible end-to-end routes. Furthermore, we analyzed the iterative negotiation process to address policy conflicts and quantitatively demonstrated the "price of autonomy," where strict individual policies degrade global feasibility and performance. The results also demonstrate that outcomes of the proposed framework depend on the operators' policies and that hop count and latency increase as the number of operators grows. These findings validate the proposed framework's ability to deliver practical benefits of orchestrated multi-operator collaboration in future NTN environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05363v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Field Tool Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05366</link><description>arXiv:2602.05366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with real-world environments and solve complex tasks. Given the growing scale of available tools, effective tool retrieval is essential to mitigate constraints of LLMs' context windows and ensure computational efficiency. Existing approaches typically treat tool retrieval as a traditional ad-hoc retrieval task, matching user queries against the entire raw tool documentation. In this paper, we identify three fundamental challenges that limit the effectiveness of this paradigm: (i) the incompleteness and structural inconsistency of tool documentation; (ii) the significant semantic and granular mismatch between user queries and technical tool documents; and, most importantly, (iii) the multi-aspect nature of tool utility, that involves distinct dimensions, such as functionality, input constraints, and output formats, varying in format and importance. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Field Tool Retrieval, a framework designed to align user intent with tool representations through fine-grained, multi-field modeling. Experimental results show that our framework achieves SOTA performance on five datasets and a mixed benchmark, exhibiting superior generalizability and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05366v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RaBiT: Residual-Aware Binarization Training for Accurate and Efficient LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05367</link><description>arXiv:2602.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05367v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PACE: Defying the Scaling Hypothesis of Exploration in Iterative Alignment for Mathematical Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05370</link><description>arXiv:2602.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative Direct Preference Optimization has emerged as the state-of-the-art paradigm for aligning Large Language Models on reasoning tasks. Standard implementations (DPO-R1) rely on Best-of-N sampling (e.g., $N \ge 8$) to mine golden trajectories from the distribution tail. In this paper, we challenge this scaling hypothesis and reveal a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in mathematical reasoning, aggressive exploration yields diminishing returns and even catastrophic policy collapse. We theoretically demonstrate that scaling $N$ amplifies verifier noise and induces detrimental distribution shifts. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{PACE} (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which replaces brute-force mining with a generation-based corrective strategy. Operating with a minimal budget ($2&lt;3$), PACE synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations. Empirical evaluations show that PACE outperforms DPO-R1 $(N=16)$ while using only about $1/5$ of the compute, demonstrating superior robustness against reward hacking and label noise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05370v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Speech-XL: Towards Long-Form Speech Understanding in Large Speech Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05373</link><description>arXiv:2602.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing success of Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) in processing short-term acoustic signals, their extension to long-form audio understanding is severely bottlenecked. This limitation stems from the limited context length and the exorbitant memory footprints required for long-form inference. In this work, we propose Speech-XL, a new model that capitalizes on the intrinsic key-value (KV) sparsification capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve high-ratio speech input compression. Specifically, we introduce a novel special token, the Speech Summarization Token (SST), for each speech interval to encapsulate the intra-interval speech information into its associated KV pairs. The SST module is trained via instruction fine-tuning, employing a curriculum learning strategy where the SST learns to compress information in a progressive manner--advancing from low-ratio (simple) to high-ratio (challenging) compression. Despite utilizing significantly less training data than other baselines, our model achieves highly competitive performance on major benchmarks, including LongSpeech and AUDIOMARATHON. By addressing the long-standing bottlenecks in long-form audio modeling, our approach offers a novel perspective on the condensation of extensive acoustic sequences.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05373v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Lingual Empirical Evaluation of Large Language Models for Arabic Medical Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05374</link><description>arXiv:2602.05374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used in medical applications, such as clinical decision support, medical education, and medical question answering. Yet, these models are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities. Recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering. Our findings reveal a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity. Tokenization analysis exposes structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, while reliability analysis suggests that model-reported confidence and explanations exhibit limited correlation with correctness. Together, these findings underscore the need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in LLMs for medical tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05374v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Erase at the Core: Representation Unlearning for Machine Unlearning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05375</link><description>arXiv:2602.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many approximate machine unlearning methods demonstrate strong logit-level forgetting -- such as near-zero accuracy on the forget set -- yet continue to preserve substantial information within their internal feature representations. We refer to this discrepancy as superficial forgetting. Recent studies indicate that most existing unlearning approaches primarily alter the final classifier, leaving intermediate representations largely unchanged and highly similar to those of the original model. To address this limitation, we introduce the Erase at the Core (EC), a framework designed to enforce forgetting throughout the entire network hierarchy. EC integrates multi-layer contrastive unlearning on the forget set with retain set preservation through deeply supervised learning. Concretely, EC attaches auxiliary modules to intermediate layers and applies both contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses at each supervision point, with layer-wise weighted losses. Experimental results show that EC not only achieves effective logit-level forgetting, but also substantially reduces representational similarity to the original model across intermediate layers. Furthermore, EC is model-agnostic and can be incorporated as a plug-in module into existing unlearning methods, improving representation-level forgetting while maintaining performance on the retain set.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05375v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAIL: Self-Amplified Iterative Learning for Diffusion Model Alignment with Minimal Human Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05380</link><description>arXiv:2602.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with human preferences remains challenging, particularly when reward models are unavailable or impractical to obtain, and collecting large-scale preference datasets is prohibitively expensive. \textit{This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve effective alignment using only minimal human feedback, without auxiliary reward models, by unlocking the latent capabilities within diffusion models themselves?} In this paper, we propose \textbf{SAIL} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}mplified \textbf{I}terative \textbf{L}earning), a novel framework that enables diffusion models to act as their own teachers through iterative self-improvement. Starting from a minimal seed set of human-annotated preference pairs, SAIL operates in a closed-loop manner where the model progressively generates diverse samples, self-annotates preferences based on its evolving understanding, and refines itself using this self-augmented dataset. To ensure robust learning and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a ranked preference mixup strategy that carefully balances exploration with adherence to initial human priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using merely 6\% of the preference data required by existing approaches, revealing that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that, when properly harnessed, can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05380v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Clinical Validation of Medical-based Large Language Model Chatbots on Ophthalmic Patient Queries with LLM-based Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05381</link><description>arXiv:2602.05381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05381v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VRIQ: Benchmarking and Analyzing Visual-Reasoning IQ of VLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05382</link><description>arXiv:2602.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has raised the question of whether they can reliably perform nonverbal reasoning. To this end, we introduce VRIQ (Visual Reasoning IQ), a novel benchmark designed to assess and analyze the visual reasoning ability of VLMs. We evaluate models on two sets of tasks: abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks. We find that on abstract puzzles, performance remains near random with an average accuracy of around 28%, while natural tasks yield better but still weak results with 45% accuracy. We also find that tool-augmented reasoning demonstrates only modest improvements. To uncover the source of this weakness, we introduce diagnostic probes targeting perception and reasoning. Our analysis demonstrates that around 56% of failures arise from perception alone, 43% from both perception and reasoning, and only a mere 1% from reasoning alone. This motivates us to design fine-grained diagnostic probe questions targeting specific perception categories (e.g., shape, count, position, 3D/depth), revealing that certain categories cause more failures than others. Our benchmark and analysis establish that current VLMs, even with visual reasoning tools, remain unreliable abstract reasoners, mostly due to perception limitations, and offer a principled basis for improving visual reasoning in multimodal systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05382v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dolphin-v2: Universal Document Parsing via Scalable Anchor Prompting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05384</link><description>arXiv:2602.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document parsing has garnered widespread attention as vision-language models (VLMs) advance OCR capabilities. However, the field remains fragmented across dozens of specialized models with varying strengths, forcing users to navigate complex model selection and limiting system scalability. Moreover, existing two-stage approaches depend on axis-aligned bounding boxes for layout detection, failing to handle distorted or photographed documents effectively. To this end, we present Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model that substantially improves upon the original Dolphin. In the first stage, Dolphin-v2 jointly performs document type classification (digital-born versus photographed) alongside layout analysis. For digital-born documents, it conducts finer-grained element detection with reading order prediction. In the second stage, we employ a hybrid parsing strategy: photographed documents are parsed holistically as complete pages to handle geometric distortions, while digital-born documents undergo element-wise parallel parsing guided by the detected layout anchors, enabling efficient content extraction. Compared with the original Dolphin, Dolphin-v2 introduces several crucial enhancements: (1) robust parsing of photographed documents via holistic page-level understanding, (2) finer-grained element detection (21 categories) with semantic attribute extraction such as author information and document metadata, and (3) code block recognition with indentation preservation, which existing systems typically lack. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and our self-constructed RealDoc-160 benchmark. The results demonstrate substantial improvements: +14.78 points overall on the challenging OmniDocBench and 91% error reduction on photographed documents, while maintaining efficient inference through parallel processing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05384v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IESR:Efficient MCTS-Based Modular Reasoning for Text-to-SQL with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05385</link><description>arXiv:2602.05385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a key natural language processing task that maps natural language questions to SQL queries, enabling intuitive interaction with web-based databases. Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current coder models exhibit notable biases and deficiencies in physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning, highlighting important directions for future research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, their real-world applicability has expanded significantly, accompanied by new security challenges. Most existing agent defense mechanisms adopt a mandatory checking paradigm, in which security validation is forcibly triggered at predefined stages of the agent lifecycle. In this work, we argue that effective agent security should be intrinsic and selective rather than architecturally decoupled and mandatory. We propose Spider-Sense framework, an event-driven defense framework based on Intrinsic Risk Sensing (IRS), which allows agents to maintain latent vigilance and trigger defenses only upon risk perception. Once triggered, the Spider-Sense invokes a hierarchical defence mechanism that trades off efficiency and precision: it resolves known patterns via lightweight similarity matching while escalating ambiguous cases to deep internal reasoning, thereby eliminating reliance on external models. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce S$^2$Bench, a lifecycle-aware benchmark featuring realistic tool execution and multi-stage attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Spider-Sense achieves competitive or superior defense performance, attaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) and False Positive Rate (FPR), with only a marginal latency overhead of 8.3\%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05386v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced 3D MRI-to-CT Synthesis for MRI-Only Radiotherapy Planning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05387</link><description>arXiv:2602.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation; however, the absence of electron density information limits its direct use for dose calculation. As a result, current radiotherapy workflows rely on combined MRI and CT acquisitions, increasing registration uncertainty and procedural complexity. Synthetic CT generation enables MRI only planning but remains challenging due to nonlinear MRI-CT relationships and anatomical variability. We propose Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced Med2Transformer, a 3D architecture that integrates convolutional encoding with dual Swin Transformer branches to model both local anatomical detail and long-range contextual dependencies. Multi-scale shifted window attention with hierarchical feature aggregation improves anatomical fidelity. Experiments on public and clinical datasets demonstrate higher image similarity and improved geometric accuracy compared with baseline methods. Dosimetric evaluation shows clinically acceptable performance, with a mean target dose error of 1.69%.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for decision-making in domains such as weather, energy, and finance. It remains challenging because real-world sequences intertwine slow trends, multi-rate seasonalities, and irregular residuals. Existing methods often rely on rigid, hand-crafted decompositions or generic end-to-end architectures that entangle components and underuse structure shared across variables. To address these limitations, we propose DecompSSM, an end-to-end decomposition framework using three parallel deep state space model branches to capture trend, seasonal, and residual components. The model features adaptive temporal scales via an input-dependent predictor, a refinement module for shared cross-variable context, and an auxiliary loss that enforces reconstruction and orthogonality. Across standard benchmarks (ECL, Weather, ETTm2, and PEMS04), DecompSSM outperformed strong baselines, indicating the effectiveness of combining component-wise deep state space models and global context refinement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05389v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Assessing Electricity Demand Forecasting with Exogenous Data in Time Series Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05390</link><description>arXiv:2602.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series foundation models have emerged as a new paradigm for forecasting, yet their ability to effectively leverage exogenous features -- critical for electricity demand forecasting -- remains unclear. This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05390v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dataset Distillation via Relative Distribution Matching and Cognitive Heritage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05391</link><description>arXiv:2602.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a highly compact dataset that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset on downstream tasks. For the classification task that use pre-trained self-supervised models as backbones, previous linear gradient matching optimizes synthetic images by encouraging them to mimic the gradient updates induced by real images on the linear classifier. However, this batch-level formulation requires loading thousands of real images and applying multiple rounds of differentiable augmentations to synthetic images at each distillation step, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce statistical flow matching , a stable and efficient supervised learning framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data. Our approach loads raw statistics only once and performs a single augmentation pass on the synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime. Furthermore, we propose a classifier inheritance strategy that reuses the classifier trained on the original dataset for inference, requiring only an extremely lightweight linear projector and marginal storage while achieving substantial performance gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05391v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Length: Context-Aware Expansion and Independence as Developmentally Sensitive Evaluation in Child Utterances</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05392</link><description>arXiv:2602.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of children's utterances in adult-child dialogue remains challenging due to insufficient context-sensitive metrics. Common proxies such as Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), lexical diversity (vocd-D), and readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index) are dominated by length and ignore conversational context, missing aspects of response quality such as reasoning depth, topic maintenance, and discourse planning. We introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework that first classifies the Previous Adult Utterance Type and then scores the child's response along two axes: Expansion (contextual elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (the child's contribution to advancing the discourse). These axes reflect fundamental dimensions in child language development, where Expansion captures elaboration, clause combining, and causal and contrastive connectives. Independence captures initiative, topic control, decreasing reliance on adult scaffolding through growing self-regulation, and audience design. We establish developmental validity by showing age-related patterns and demonstrate predictive value by improving age estimation over common baselines. We further confirm semantic sensitivity by detecting differences tied to discourse relations. Our metrics align with human judgments, enabling large-scale evaluation. This shifts child utterance assessment from simply measuring length to evaluating how meaningfully the child's speech contributes to and advances the conversation within its context.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05392v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Late-to-Early Training: LET LLMs Learn Earlier, So Faster and Better</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05393</link><description>arXiv:2602.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable empirical success through scaling model and data size, pretraining has become increasingly critical yet computationally prohibitive, hindering rapid development. Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: \textit{Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models?} In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset, our method achieves up to 1.6$\times$ speedup with nearly 5\% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even when using a pretrained model with 10$\times$ fewer parameters than the target model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05393v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Linear Systems and Eigenvalue Problems: Open Questions from a Simons Workshop</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05394</link><description>arXiv:2602.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents a series of open questions arising in matrix computations, i.e., the numerical solution of linear algebra problems.

The complexity and numerical solution of linear algebra problems %in matrix computations and related fields is a crosscutting area between theoretical computer science and numerical analysis. The value of the particular problem formulations here is that they were produced via discussions between researchers from both groups.
  The open questions are organized in five categories: iterative solvers for linear systems, eigenvalue computation, low-rank approximation, randomized sketching, and other areas including tensors, quantum systems, and matrix functions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05394v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explainable Pathomics Feature Visualization via Correlation-aware Conditional Feature Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05397</link><description>arXiv:2602.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathomics is a recent approach that offers rich quantitative features beyond what black-box deep learning can provide, supporting more reproducible and explainable biomarkers in digital pathology. However, many derived features (e.g., "second-order moment") remain difficult to interpret, especially across different clinical contexts, which limits their practical adoption. Conditional diffusion models show promise for explainability through feature editing, but they typically assume feature independence**--**an assumption violated by intrinsically correlated pathomics features. Consequently, editing one feature while fixing others can push the model off the biological manifold and produce unrealistic artifacts. To address this, we propose a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing. Unlike existing approaches, our method regularizes feature trajectories within a disentangled latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder (VAE). This ensures that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells. These optimized features then guide a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity images. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to navigate the manifold of pathomics features when editing those features. The proposed method outperforms baseline methods in conditional feature editing while preserving structural coherence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05397v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OPUS: Towards Efficient and Principled Data Selection in Large Language Model Pre-training in Every Iteration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05400</link><description>arXiv:2602.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As high-quality public text approaches exhaustion, a phenomenon known as the Data Wall, pre-training is shifting from more tokens to better tokens. However, existing methods either rely on heuristic static filters that ignore training dynamics, or use dynamic yet optimizer-agnostic criteria based on raw gradients. We propose OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), a dynamic data selection framework that defines utility in the optimizer-induced update space. OPUS scores candidates by projecting their effective updates, shaped by modern optimizers, onto a target direction derived from a stable, in-distribution proxy. To ensure scalability, we employ Ghost technique with CountSketch for computational efficiency, and Boltzmann sampling for data diversity, incurring only 4.7\% additional compute overhead. OPUS achieves remarkable results across diverse corpora, quality tiers, optimizers, and model scales. In pre-training of GPT-2 Large/XL on FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu with 30B tokens, OPUS outperforms industrial-level baselines and even full 200B-token training. Moreover, when combined with industrial-level static filters, OPUS further improves pre-training efficiency, even with lower-quality data. Furthermore, in continued pre-training of Qwen3-8B-Base on SciencePedia, OPUS achieves superior performance using only 0.5B tokens compared to full training with 3B tokens, demonstrating significant data efficiency gains in specialized domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05400v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BadTemplate: A Training-Free Backdoor Attack via Chat Template Against Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05401</link><description>arXiv:2602.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chat template is a common technique used in the training and inference stages of Large Language Models (LLMs). It can transform input and output data into role-based and templated expressions to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, this also creates a breeding ground for novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we first reveal that the customizability of chat templates allows an attacker who controls the template to inject arbitrary strings into the system prompt without the user's notice. Building on this, we propose a training-free backdoor attack, termed BadTemplate. Specifically, BadTemplate inserts carefully crafted malicious instructions into the high-priority system prompt, thereby causing the target LLM to exhibit persistent backdoor behaviors. BadTemplate outperforms traditional backdoor attacks by embedding malicious instructions directly into the system prompt, eliminating the need for model retraining while achieving high attack effectiveness with minimal cost. Furthermore, its simplicity and scalability make it easily and widely deployed in real-world systems, raising serious risks of rapid propagation, economic damage, and large-scale misinformation. Furthermore, detection by major third-party platforms HuggingFace and LLM-as-a-judge proves largely ineffective against BadTemplate. Extensive experiments conducted on 5 benchmark datasets across 6 open-source and 3 closed-source LLMs, compared with 3 baselines, demonstrate that BadTemplate achieves up to a 100% attack success rate and significantly outperforms traditional prompt-based backdoors in both word-level and sentence-level attacks. Our work highlights the potential security risks raised by chat templates in the LLM supply chain, thereby supporting the development of effective defense mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05401v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Advancing Opinion Dynamics Modeling with Neural Diffusion-Convection-Reaction Equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05403</link><description>arXiv:2602.05403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05403v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enabling Large-Scale Channel Sounding for 6G: A Framework for Sparse Sampling and Multipath Component Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05405</link><description>arXiv:2602.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing the 6G vision of artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) critically requires large-scale real-world channel datasets for channel modeling and data-driven AI models. However, traditional frequency-domain channel sounding methods suffer from low efficiency due to a prohibitive number of frequency points to avoid delay ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel channel sounding framework involving sparse nonuniform sampling along with a likelihood-rectified space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (LR-SAGE) algorithm for multipath component extraction. This framework enables the acquisition of channel datasets that are tens or even hundreds of times larger within the same channel measurement duration, thereby providing the massive data required to harness the full potential of AI scaling laws. Specifically, we propose a Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy that non-uniformly distributes frequency points, effectively eliminating delay ambiguity while reducing sampling overhead by orders of magnitude. To efficiently extract multipath components (MPCs) from the channel data measured by PFS, we develop a LR-SAGE algorithm, rectifying the likelihood distortion caused by nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption effect. Simulation results and experimental validation at 280--300~GHz confirm that the proposed PFS and LR-SAGE algorithm not only achieve 50$\times$ faster measurement, a 98\% reduction in data volume and a 99.96\% reduction in post-processing computational complexity, but also successfully captures MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements, demonstrating its potential as a fundamental enabler for constructing the massive ISAC datasets required by AI-native 6G systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05405v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enabling Automatic Disordered Speech Recognition: An Impaired Speech Dataset in the Akan Language</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05406</link><description>arXiv:2602.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of impaired speech data hinders advancements in the development of inclusive speech technologies, particularly in low-resource languages such as Akan. To address this gap, this study presents a curated corpus of speech samples from native Akan speakers with speech impairment. The dataset comprises of 50.01 hours of audio recordings cutting across four classes of impaired speech namely stammering, cerebral palsy, cleft palate, and stroke induced speech disorder. Recordings were done in controlled supervised environments were participants described pre-selected images in their own words. The resulting dataset is a collection of audio recordings, transcriptions, and associated metadata on speaker demographics, class of impairment, recording environment and device. The dataset is intended to support research in low-resource automatic disordered speech recognition systems and assistive speech technology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05406v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] H-AdminSim: A Multi-Agent Simulator for Realistic Hospital Administrative Workflows with FHIR Integration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05407</link><description>arXiv:2602.05407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hospital administration departments handle a wide range of operational tasks and, in large hospitals, process over 10,000 requests per day, driving growing interest in LLM-based automation. However, prior work has focused primarily on patient--physician interactions or isolated administrative subtasks, failing to capture the complexity of real administrative workflows. To address this gap, we propose H-AdminSim, a comprehensive end-to-end simulation framework that combines realistic data generation with multi-agent-based simulation of hospital administrative workflows. These tasks are quantitatively evaluated using detailed rubrics, enabling systematic comparison of LLMs. Through FHIR integration, H-AdminSim provides a unified and interoperable environment for testing administrative workflows across heterogeneous hospital settings, serving as a standardized testbed for assessing the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rich-Media Re-Ranker: A User Satisfaction-Driven LLM Re-ranking Framework for Rich-Media Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05408</link><description>arXiv:2602.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Re-ranking plays a crucial role in modern information search systems by refining the ranking of initial search results to better satisfy user information needs. However, existing methods show two notable limitations in improving user search satisfaction: inadequate modeling of multifaceted user intents and neglect of rich side information such as visual perception signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework, which aims to enhance user search satisfaction through multi-dimensional and fine-grained modeling. Our approach begins with a Query Planner that analyzes the sequence of query refinements within a session to capture genuine search intents, decomposing the query into clear and complementary sub-queries to enable broader coverage of users' potential intents. Subsequently, moving beyond primary text content, we integrate richer side information of candidate results, including signals modeling visual content generated by the VLM-based evaluator. These comprehensive signals are then processed alongside carefully designed re-ranking principle that considers multiple facets, including content relevance and quality, information gain, information novelty, and the visual presentation of cover images. Then, the LLM-based re-ranker performs the holistic evaluation based on these principles and integrated signals. To enhance the scenario adaptability of the VLM-based evaluator and the LLM-based re-ranker, we further enhance their capabilities through multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the proposed framework has been deployed in a large-scale industrial search system, yielding substantial improvements in online user engagement rates and satisfaction metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05408v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SciDef: Automating Definition Extraction from Academic Literature with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05413</link><description>arXiv:2602.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Definitions are the foundation for any scientific work, but with a significant increase in publication numbers, gathering definitions relevant to any keyword has become challenging. We therefore introduce SciDef, an LLM-based pipeline for automated definition extraction. We test SciDef on DefExtra &amp; DefSim, novel datasets of human-extracted definitions and definition-pairs' similarity, respectively. Evaluating 16 language models across prompting strategies, we demonstrate that multi-step and DSPy-optimized prompting improve extraction performance. To evaluate extraction, we test various metrics and show that an NLI-based method yields the most reliable results. We show that LLMs are largely able to extract definitions from scientific literature (86.4% of definitions from our test-set); yet future work should focus not just on finding definitions, but on identifying relevant ones, as models tend to over-generate them.

Abstract: Global warming has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which degrade CCTV signal and video quality while disrupting traffic flow, thereby increasing traffic accident rates. Existing datasets, often limited to light haze, rain, and snow, fail to capture extreme weather conditions. To address this gap, this study introduces the Traffic Surveillance Benchmark for Occluded vehicles under various Weather conditions (TSBOW), a comprehensive dataset designed to enhance occluded vehicle detection across diverse annual weather scenarios. Comprising over 32 hours of real-world traffic data from densely populated urban areas, TSBOW includes more than 48,000 manually annotated and 3.2 million semi-labeled frames; bounding boxes spanning eight traffic participant classes from large vehicles to micromobility devices and pedestrians. We establish an object detection benchmark for TSBOW, highlighting challenges posed by occlusions and adverse weather. With its varied road types, scales, and viewpoints, TSBOW serves as a critical resource for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Our findings underscore the potential of CCTV-based traffic monitoring, pave the way for new research and applications.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under long-tailed distributions is a highly challenging task because the scarcity of samples in tail classes leads to blurred decision boundaries in the feature space. Current state-of-the-art (sota) methods typically employ Outlier Exposure (OE) strategies, relying on large-scale real external datasets (such as 80 Million Tiny Images) to regularize the feature space. However, this dependence on external data often becomes infeasible in practical deployment due to high data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity. To this end, we propose a novel data-free framework aimed at completely eliminating reliance on external datasets while maintaining superior detection performance. We introduce a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy that models statistical properties using the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hypersphere. Specifically, we locate a low-likelihood annulus in the feature space and perform directional sampling of virtual outliers in this region. Simultaneously, we introduce a new Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) that utilizes contrastive learning to maximize the distinction between in-distribution (ID) features and these synthesized boundary outliers. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms sota approaches that utilize external real images.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05415v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Grammatical Error Correction Evaluation by Optimally Transporting Edit Representation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05419</link><description>arXiv:2602.05419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic evaluation in grammatical error correction (GEC) is crucial for selecting the best-performing systems. Currently, reference-based metrics are a popular choice, which basically measure the similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences. However, similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, are often ineffective, since many words in the source sentences remain unchanged in both the hypothesis and the reference. This study focuses on edits specifically designed for GEC, i.e., ERRANT, and computes similarity measured over the edits from the source sentence. To this end, we propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, which transports these edit vectors from hypothesis to reference using unbalanced optimal transport. Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain where many edits occur. Moreover, our method is highly interpretable because the transport plan can be interpreted as a soft edit alignment, making UOT-ERRANT a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems. Our code is available from https://github.com/gotutiyan/uot-errant.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05419v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Disco: Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware Collaborative Coloring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05420</link><description>arXiv:2602.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate cell instance segmentation is foundational for digital pathology analysis. Existing methods based on contour detection and distance mapping still face significant challenges in processing complex and dense cellular regions. Graph coloring-based methods provide a new paradigm for this task, yet the effectiveness of this paradigm in real-world scenarios with dense overlaps and complex topologies has not been verified. Addressing this issue, we release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025, which contains highly complex and dense sub-cellular nuclear arrangements. We conduct the first systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and reveal an important discovery: most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles (predominantly triangles). This makes simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues, while higher-chromaticity models would cause representational redundancy and optimization difficulties. Building on this observation of complex real-world contexts, we propose Disco (Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware COllaborative Coloring), an adjacency-aware framework based on the "divide and conquer" principle. It uniquely combines a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts. First, "Explicit Marking" strategy transforms the topological challenge into a learnable classification task by recursively decomposing the cell graph and isolating a "conflict set." Second, "Implicit Disambiguation" mechanism resolves ambiguities in conflict regions by enforcing feature dissimilarity between different instances, enabling the model to learn separable feature representations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05420v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NeVStereo: A NeRF-Driven NVS-Stereo Architecture for High-Fidelity 3D Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05423</link><description>arXiv:2602.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern dense 3D reconstruction, feed-forward systems (e.g., VGGT, pi3) focus on end-to-end matching and geometry prediction but do not explicitly output the novel view synthesis (NVS). Neural rendering-based approaches offer high-fidelity NVS and detailed geometry from posed images, yet they typically assume fixed camera poses and can be sensitive to pose errors. As a result, it remains non-trivial to obtain a single framework that can offer accurate poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views. We present NeVStereo, a NeRF-driven NVS-stereo architecture that aims to jointly deliver camera poses, multi-view depth, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB-only inputs. NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage that updates both depth and the radiance field to improve geometric consistency. This design mitigated the common NeRF-based issues such as surface stacking, artifacts, and pose-depth coupling. Across indoor, outdoor, tabletop, and aerial benchmarks, our experiments indicate that NeVStereo achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance, with up to 36% lower depth error, 10.4% improved pose accuracy, 4.5% higher NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality (F1 91.93%, Chamfer 4.35 mm) compared to existing prestigious methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05423v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] THOR: Inductive Link Prediction over Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05424</link><description>arXiv:2602.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-AD: Cross-Domain Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Medical and Industrial Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05426</link><description>arXiv:2602.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional deep learning models often lack annotated data, especially in cross-domain applications such as anomaly detection, which is critical for early disease diagnosis in medicine and defect detection in industry. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-AD, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for robust unsupervised anomaly detection across medical and industrial images. Our approach employs the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to enhance feature extraction via channel-wise attention, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and detect subtle anomalies. Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers informative features from the teacher to the student model, enabling effective learning of the differences between normal and anomalous data. Then, the discriminator network further enhances the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. At the inference stage, by integrating multi-scale features, the student model can detect anomalies of varying sizes. The teacher-student (T-S) architecture ensures consistent representation of high-dimensional features while adapting them to enhance anomaly detection. Multi-AD was evaluated on several medical datasets, including brain MRI, liver CT, and retina OCT, as well as industrial datasets, such as MVTec AD, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving the best average AUROC for both image-level (81.4% for medical and 99.6% for industrial) and pixel-level (97.0% for medical and 98.4% for industrial) tasks, making it effective for real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05426v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] M$^2$-Miner: Multi-Agent Enhanced MCTS for Mobile GUI Agent Data Mining</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05429</link><description>arXiv:2602.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05429v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Day-Ahead Electricity Price Forecasting for Volatile Markets Using Foundation Models with Regularization Strategy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05430</link><description>arXiv:2602.05430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LTRAS: A Linkable Threshold Ring Adaptor Signature Scheme for Efficient and Private Cross-Chain Transactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05431</link><description>arXiv:2602.05431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the advantages of decentralization and immutability, blockchain technology faces significant scalability and throughput limitations, which has prompted the exploration of off-chain solutions like payment channels. Adaptor signatures have been considered a promising primitive for constructing such channels due to their support for atomicity, offering an alternative to traditional hash-timelock contracts. However, standard adaptor signatures may reveal signer identity, raising potential privacy concerns. While ring signatures can mitigate this issue by providing anonymity, they often introduce high communication overhead, particularly in multi-account payment settings commonly used in UTXO-based blockchains like Monero. To address these limitations, we propose a Linkable Threshold Ring Adaptor Signature (LTRAS) scheme, which integrates the conditional binding of adaptor signatures, the multi-account payment of threshold ring signatures, and the linkability for preventing double-spending. The formal definition, security model and concrete construction of LTRAS are provided. We also analyze its security and evaluate its performance through theoretical analysis and experimental implementation. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieve significantly lower computation and communication overhead compared to existing schemes in large ring sizes and multi-account payment scenarios. Finally, we discuss its application in cross-chain atomic swaps, demonstrating its potential for enhancing privacy and efficiency in blockchain transactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05431v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LD-SLRO: Latent Diffusion Structured Light for 3-D Reconstruction of Highly Reflective Objects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05434</link><description>arXiv:2602.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry-based 3-D reconstruction of objects with high reflectivity and low surface roughness remains a significant challenge. When measuring such glossy surfaces, specular reflection and indirect illumination often lead to severe distortion or loss of the projected fringe patterns. To address these issues, we propose a latent diffusion-based structured light for reflective objects (LD-SLRO). Phase-shifted fringe images captured from highly reflective surfaces are first encoded to extract latent representations that capture surface reflectance characteristics. These latent features are then used as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model, which probabilistically suppresses reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information, yielding high-quality fringe images. The proposed components, including the specular reflection encoder, time-variant channel affine layer, and attention modules, further improve fringe restoration quality. In addition, LD-SLRO provides high flexibility in configuring the input and output fringe sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves both fringe quality and 3-D reconstruction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, reducing the average root-mean-squared error from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05434v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stable Velocity: A Variance Perspective on Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05435</link><description>arXiv:2602.05435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity, a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can achieve high accuracy while still accepting culturally plausible but visually incorrect interpretations. Existing hallucination benchmarks rarely test this failure mode, particularly outside Western contexts and English. We introduce M2CQA, a culturally grounded multimodal benchmark built from images spanning 17 MENA countries, paired with contrastive true and counterfactual statements in English, Arabic, and its dialects. To isolate hallucination beyond raw accuracy, we propose the CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR), which measures counterfactual acceptance conditioned on correctly answering the true statement. Evaluating state-of-the-art VLMs under multiple prompting strategies, we find that CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high. Moreover, reasoning-first prompting consistently increases counterfactual hallucination, while answering before justifying improves robustness. We will make the experimental resources and dataset publicly available for the community.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05437v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synthetic Defect Geometries of Cast Metal Objects Modeled via 2d Voronoi Tessellations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05440</link><description>arXiv:2602.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In industry, defect detection is crucial for quality control. Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are preferred as they do not influence the functionality of the object while inspecting. Automated data evaluation for automated defect detection is a growing field of research. In particular, machine learning approaches show promising results. To provide training data in sufficient amount and quality, synthetic data can be used. Rule-based approaches enable synthetic data generation in a controllable environment. Therefore, a digital twin of the inspected object including synthetic defects is needed. We present parametric methods to model 3d mesh objects of various defect types that can then be added to the object geometry to obtain synthetic defective objects. The models are motivated by common defects in metal casting but can be transferred to other machining procedures that produce similar defect shapes. Synthetic data resembling the real inspection data can then be created by using a physically based Monte Carlo simulation of the respective testing method. Using our defect models, a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set can be generated with the possibility to include rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity. Pixel-perfect annotation can be created in parallel. As an example, we will use visual surface inspection, but the procedure can be applied in combination with simulations for any other NDT method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05440v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Affordance Generalization with BusyBox</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05441</link><description>arXiv:2602.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been attracting the attention of researchers and practitioners thanks to their promise of generalization. Although single-task policies still offer competitive performance, VLAs are increasingly able to handle commands and environments unseen in their training set. While generalization in vision and language space is undoubtedly important for robust versatile behaviors, a key meta-skill VLAs need to possess is affordance generalization -- the ability to manipulate new objects with familiar physical features.
  In this work, we present BusyBox, a physical benchmark for systematic semi-automatic evaluation of VLAs' affordance generalization. BusyBox consists of 6 modules with switches, sliders, wires, buttons, a display, and a dial. The modules can be swapped and rotated to create a multitude of BusyBox variations with different visual appearances but the same set of affordances. We empirically demonstrate that generalization across BusyBox variants is highly challenging even for strong open-weights VLAs such as $\pi_{0.5}$ and GR00T-N1.6. To encourage the research community to evaluate their own VLAs on BusyBox and to propose new affordance generalization experiments, we have designed BusyBox to be easy to build in most robotics labs. We release the full set of CAD files for 3D-printing its parts as well as a bill of materials for (optionally) assembling its electronics. We also publish a dataset of language-annotated demonstrations that we collected using the common bimanual Mobile Aloha robot on the canonical BusyBox configuration. All of the released materials are available at https://microsoft.github.io/BusyBox.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05441v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust data-driven model-reference control of linear perturbed systems via sliding mode generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05442</link><description>arXiv:2602.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-based integral sliding mode control scheme for robustification of model-reference controllers, accommodating generic multivariable linear systems with unknown dynamics and affected by matched disturbances. Specifically, an integral sliding mode control (ISMC) law is recast into a data-based framework relying on an integral sliding variable depending only on the reference model, without the need of modeling the plant. The main strength of the proposed approach is the enforcement of the desired reference model in closed-loop under sliding mode conditions, despite the lack of knowledge of the model dynamics and the presence of the matched disturbances. Moreover, the conditions required to guarantee an integral sliding mode generation and the closed-loop stability are formally analyzed in the paper, remarking the generality of the proposed data-driven integral sliding mode control (DD-ISMC) with respect to the related model-based counterpart. Finally, the main practices for the data-based design of the proposed control scheme are deeply discussed in the paper, and the proposed method is tested in simulation on a benchmark example, and experimentally on a real laboratory setup. Simulation and experimental evidence fully corroborates the theoretical analysis, thus motivating further research in this direction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Front-Door Adjustment for Robust Jailbreak Attacks on LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05444</link><description>arXiv:2602.05444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) often operate as latent internal states, obscuring the model's inherent capabilities. Building on this observation, we model the safety mechanism as an unobserved confounder from a causal perspective. Then, we propose the \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{F}ront-Door \textbf{A}djustment \textbf{A}ttack ({\textbf{CFA}}$^2$) to jailbreak LLM, which is a framework that leverages Pearl's Front-Door Criterion to sever the confounding associations for robust jailbreaking. Specifically, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to physically strip defense-related features, isolating the core task intent. We further reduce computationally expensive marginalization to a deterministic intervention with low inference complexity. Experiments demonstrate that {CFA}$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while offering a mechanistic interpretation of the jailbreaking process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05444v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Forward Index Compression for Learned Sparse Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05445</link><description>arXiv:2602.05445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text retrieval using learned sparse representations of queries and documents has, over the years, evolved into a highly effective approach to search. It is thanks to recent advances in approximate nearest neighbor search-with the emergence of highly efficient algorithms such as the inverted index-based Seismic and the graph-based Hnsw-that retrieval with sparse representations became viable in practice. In this work, we scrutinize the efficiency of sparse retrieval algorithms and focus particularly on the size of a data structure that is common to all algorithmic flavors and that constitutes a substantial fraction of the overall index size: the forward index. In particular, we seek compression techniques to reduce the storage footprint of the forward index without compromising search quality or inner product computation latency. In our examination with various integer compression techniques, we report that StreamVByte achieves the best trade-off between memory footprint, retrieval accuracy, and latency. We then improve StreamVByte by introducing DotVByte, a new algorithm tailored to inner product computation. Experiments on MsMarco show that our improvements lead to significant space savings while maintaining retrieval efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05445v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiLLS: Interactive Diagnosis of LLM-based Multi-agent Systems via Layered Summary of Agent Behaviors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05446</link><description>arXiv:2602.05446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated impressive capabilities in handling complex tasks. However, the complexity of agentic behaviors makes these systems difficult to understand. When failures occur, developers often struggle to identify root causes and to determine actionable paths for improvement. Traditional methods that rely on inspecting raw log records are inefficient, given both the large volume and complexity of data. To address this challenge, we propose a framework and an interactive system, DiLLS, designed to reveal and structure the behaviors of multi-agent systems. The key idea is to organize information across three levels of query completion: activities, actions, and operations. By probing the multi-agent system through natural language, DiLLS derives and organizes information about planning and execution into a structured, multi-layered summary. Through a user study, we show that DiLLS significantly improves developers' effectiveness and efficiency in identifying, diagnosing, and understanding failures in LLM-based multi-agent systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05446v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structured Context Engineering for File-Native Agentic Systems: Evaluating Schema Accuracy, Format Effectiveness, and Multi-File Navigation at Scale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05447</link><description>arXiv:2602.05447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model agents increasingly operate external systems through programmatic interfaces, yet practitioners lack empirical guidance on how to structure the context these agents consume. Using SQL generation as a proxy for programmatic agent operations, we present a systematic study of context engineering for structured data, comprising 9,649 experiments across 11 models, 4 formats (YAML, Markdown, JSON, Token-Oriented Object Notation [TOON]), and schemas ranging from 10 to 10,000 tables.
  Our findings challenge common assumptions. First, architecture choice is model-dependent: file-based context retrieval improves accuracy for frontier-tier models (Claude, GPT, Gemini; +2.7%, p=0.029) but shows mixed results for open source models (aggregate -7.7%, p&lt;0.001), with deficits varying substantially by model. Second, format does not significantly affect aggregate accuracy (chi-squared=2.45, p=0.484), though individual models, particularly open source, exhibit format-specific sensitivities. Third, model capability is the dominant factor, with a 21 percentage point accuracy gap between frontier and open source tiers that dwarfs any format or architecture effect. Fourth, file-native agents scale to 10,000 tables through domain-partitioned schemas while maintaining high navigation accuracy. Fifth, file size does not predict runtime efficiency: compact formats can consume significantly more tokens at scale due to format-unfamiliar search patterns.
  These findings provide practitioners with evidence-based guidance for deploying LLM agents on structured systems, demonstrating that architectural decisions should be tailored to model capability rather than assuming universal best practices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05447v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BLITZRANK: Principled Zero-shot Ranking Agents with Tournament Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05448</link><description>arXiv:2602.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have emerged as powerful zero-shot rerankers for retrieval-augmented generation, offering strong generalization without task-specific training. However, existing LLM reranking methods either rely on heuristics that fail to fully exploit the information revealed by each ranking decision or are inefficient when they do. We introduce a tournament graph framework that provides a principled foundation for $k$-wise reranking. Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings. Empirically, across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, our method achieves Pareto dominance over existing methods: matching or exceeding accuracy while requiring 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable approaches, and 7$\times$ fewer than pairwise methods at near-identical quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05448v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DisCa: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers with Distillation-Compatible Learnable Feature Caching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05449</link><description>arXiv:2602.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved great success in the field of video generation, this progress is accompanied by a rapidly escalating computational burden. Among the existing acceleration methods, Feature Caching is popular due to its training-free property and considerable speedup performance, but it inevitably faces semantic and detail drop with further compression. Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps. This paper novelly introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for the first time. We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of highly compressed distillation on large-scale video models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation. By undertaking these initiatives, we further push the acceleration boundaries to $11.8\times$ while preserving generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is in the supplementary materials and will be publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05449v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DistillER: Knowledge Distillation in Entity Resolution with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05452</link><description>arXiv:2602.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Entity Resolution (ER) have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving strong performance but at the cost of substantial computational resources or high financial overhead. Existing LLM-based ER approaches operate either in unsupervised settings and rely on very large and costly models, or in supervised settings and require ground-truth annotations, leaving a critical gap between time efficiency and effectiveness. To make LLM-powered ER more practical, we investigate Knowledge Distillation (KD) as a means to transfer knowledge from large, effective models (Teachers) to smaller, more efficient models (Students) without requiring gold labels. We introduce DistillER, the first framework that systematically bridges this gap across three dimensions: (i) Data Selection, where we study strategies for identifying informative subsets of data; (ii) Knowledge Elicitation, where we compare single- and multi-teacher settings across LLMs and smaller language models (SLMs); and (iii) Distillation Algorithms, where we evaluate supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning approaches. Our experiments reveal that supervised fine-tuning of Students on noisy labels generated by LLM Teachers consistently outperforms alternative KD strategies, while also enabling high-quality explanation generation. Finally, we benchmark DistillER against established supervised and unsupervised ER methods based on LLMs and SLMs, demonstrating significant improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05452v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Attention Retention for Continual Learning with Vision Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05454</link><description>arXiv:2602.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers AI systems to progressively acquire knowledge from non-stationary data streams. However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05454v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emergence-as-Code for Self-Governing Reliable Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05458</link><description>arXiv:2602.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SLO-as-code has made per-service} reliability declarative, but user experience is defined by journeys whose reliability is an emergent property of microservice topology, routing, redundancy, timeouts/fallbacks, shared failure domains, and tail amplification. As a result, journey objectives (e.g., "checkout p99 &lt; 400 ms") are often maintained outside code and drift as the system evolves, forcing teams to either miss user expectations or over-provision and gate releases with ad-hoc heuristics. We propose Emergence-as-Code (EmaC), a vision for making journey reliability computable and governable via intent plus evidence. An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes operational artifacts (e.g., tracing and traffic configuration) to synthesize a candidate journey model with provenance and confidence. From the last accepted model, the EmaC compiler/controller derives bounded journey SLOs and budgets under explicit correlation assumptions (optimistic independence vs. pessimistic shared fate), and emits control-plane artifacts (burn-rate alerts, rollout gates, action guards) that are reviewable in a Git workflow. An anonymized artifact repository provides a runnable example specification and generated outputs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05458v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Are RL Hyperparameters Benign? A Study in Offline Goal-Conditioned RL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05459</link><description>arXiv:2602.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\approx$ 20\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05459v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explicit List-Decodable Linearized Reed-Solomon Subspace Codes via Subspace Designs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05462</link><description>arXiv:2602.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sum-rank metric is the mixture of the Hamming and rank metrics. The sum-rank metric found its application in network coding, locally repairable codes, space-time coding, and quantum-resistant cryptography. Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes are the sum-rank analogue of Reed-Solomon codes and strictly generalize both Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes.
  In this work, we construct an explicit family of $\mathbb{F}_h$-linear sum-rank metric codes over arbitrary fields $\mathbb{F}_h$. Our construction enables efficient list decoding up to a fraction $\rho$ of errors in the sum-rank metric with rate $1-\rho-\varepsilon$, for any desired $\rho \in (0,1)$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Our codes are subcodes of LRS codes, obtained by restricting message polynomials to an $\mathbb{F}_h$-subspace derived from subspace designs, and the decoding list size is bounded by $h^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$.
  Beyond the standard LRS setting, we further extend our linear-algebraic decoding framework to folded Linearized Reed-Solomon (FLRS) codes. We show that folded evaluations satisfy appropriate interpolation conditions and that the corresponding solution space forms a low-dimensional, structured affine subspace. This structure enables effective control of the list size and yields the first explicit positive-rate FLRS subcodes that are efficiently list decodable beyond the unique-decoding radius. To the best of our knowledge, this also constitutes the first explicit construction of positive-rate sum-rank metric codes that admit efficient list decoding beyond the unique decoding radius, thereby providing a new general framework for constructing efficiently decodable codes under the sum-rank metric.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05462v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic Limits of Physical Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05463</link><description>arXiv:2602.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities at the cost of substantial energy consumption. To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05463v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Refine and Purify: Orthogonal Basis Optimization with Null-Space Denoising for Conditional Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05464</link><description>arXiv:2602.05464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05464v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can We Classify Flaky Tests Using Only Test Code? An LLM-Based Empirical Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05465</link><description>arXiv:2602.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flaky tests yield inconsistent results when they are repeatedly executed on the same code revision. They interfere with automated quality assurance of code changes and hinder efficient software testing. Previous work evaluated approaches to train machine learning models to classify flaky tests based on identifiers in the test code. However, the resulting classifiers have been shown to lack generalizability, hindering their applicability in practical environments. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the capability to generalize across various tasks. Thus, they represent a promising approach to address the generalizability problem of previous approaches. In this study, we evaluated three LLMs (two general-purpose models, one code-specific model) using three prompting techniques on two benchmark datasets from prior studies on flaky test classification. Furthermore, we manually investigated 50 samples from the given datasets to determine whether classifying flaky tests based only on test code is feasible for humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to classify flaky tests given only the test code. The results of our best prompt-model combination were only marginally better than random guessing. In our manual analysis, we found that the test code does not necessarily contain sufficient information for a flakiness classification. Our findings motivate future work to evaluate LLMs for flakiness classification with additional context, for example, using retrieval-augmented generation or agentic AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05465v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimization is Not Enough: Why Problem Formulation Deserves Equal Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05466</link><description>arXiv:2602.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box optimization is increasingly used in engineering design problems where simulation-based evaluations are costly and gradients are unavailable. In this context, the optimization community has largely analyzed algorithm performance in context-free setups, while not enough attention has been devoted to how problem formulation and domain knowledge may affect the optimization outcomes. We address this gap through a case study in the topology optimization of laminated composite structures, formulated as a black-box optimization problem. Specifically, we consider the design of a cantilever beam under a volume constraint, intending to minimize compliance while optimizing both the structural topology and fiber orientations. To assess the impact of problem formulation, we explicitly separate topology and material design variables and compare two strategies: a concurrent approach that optimizes all variables simultaneously without leveraging physical insight, and a sequential approach that optimizes variables of the same nature in stages. Our results show that context-agnostic strategies consistently lead to suboptimal or non-physical designs. In contrast, the sequential strategy yields better-performing and more interpretable solutions. These findings underscore the value of incorporating, when available, domain knowledge into the optimization process and motivate the development of new black-box benchmarks that reward physically informed and context-aware optimization strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05466v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MerNav: A Highly Generalizable Memory-Execute-Review Framework for Zero-Shot Object Goal Navigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05467</link><description>arXiv:2602.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is one of the fundamental capabilities for embodied intelligence and a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed. However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of both success rate (SR) and generalization: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches typically achieve higher SR, while Training-Free (TF) approaches often generalize better, but it is difficult to obtain both simultaneously. To this end, we propose a Memory-Execute-Review framework. It consists of three parts: a hierarchical memory module for providing information support, an execute module for routine decision-making and actions, and a review module for handling abnormal situations and correcting behavior. We validated the effectiveness of this framework on the Object Goal Navigation task. Across 4 datasets, our average SR achieved absolute improvements of 7% and 5% compared to all baseline methods under TF and Zero-Shot (ZS) settings, respectively. On the most commonly used HM3D_v0.1 and the more challenging open vocabulary dataset HM3D_OVON, the SR improved by 8% and 6%, under ZS settings. Furthermore, on the MP3D and HM3D_OVON datasets, our method not only outperformed all TF methods but also surpassed all SFT methods, achieving comprehensive leadership in both SR (5% and 2%) and generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05467v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TaSA: Two-Phased Deep Predictive Learning of Tactile Sensory Attenuation for Improving In-Grasp Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05468</link><description>arXiv:2602.05468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can achieve diverse in-hand manipulations, such as object pinching and tool use, which often involve simultaneous contact between the object and multiple fingers. This is still an open issue for robotic hands because such dexterous manipulation requires distinguishing between tactile sensations generated by their self-contact and those arising from external contact. Otherwise, object/robot breakage happens due to contacts/collisions. Indeed, most approaches ignore self-contact altogether, by constraining motion to avoid/ignore self-tactile information during contact. While this reduces complexity, it also limits generalization to real-world scenarios where self-contact is inevitable. Humans overcome this challenge through self-touch perception, using predictive mechanisms that anticipate the tactile consequences of their own motion, through a principle called sensory attenuation, where the nervous system differentiates predictable self-touch signals, allowing novel object stimuli to stand out as relevant. Deriving from this, we introduce TaSA, a two-phased deep predictive learning framework. In the first phase, TaSA explicitly learns self-touch dynamics, modeling how a robot's own actions generate tactile feedback. In the second phase, this learned model is incorporated into the motion learning phase, to emphasize object contact signals during manipulation. We evaluate TaSA on a set of insertion tasks, which demand fine tactile discrimination: inserting a pencil lead into a mechanical pencil, inserting coins into a slot, and fixing a paper clip onto a sheet of paper, with various orientations, positions, and sizes. Across all tasks, policies trained with TaSA achieve significantly higher success rates than baseline methods, demonstrating that structured tactile perception with self-touch based on sensory attenuation is critical for dexterous robotic manipulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05468v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning under Ambiguity: Uncertainty-Aware Multilingual Emotion Classification under Partial Supervision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05471</link><description>arXiv:2602.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary knowledge-based systems increasingly rely on multilingual emotion identification to support intelligent decision-making, yet they face major challenges due to emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision. Emotion recognition from text is inherently uncertain because multiple emotional states often co-occur and emotion annotations are frequently missing or heterogeneous. Most existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision. This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty. The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization and an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism that down-weights highly ambiguous training instances rather than treating missing labels as negative evidence. A mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization is further incorporated to enable robust learning under partial supervision. Experiments on English, Spanish, and Arabic emotion classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, along with improved training stability, robustness to annotation sparsity, and enhanced interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05471v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ALIVE: Awakening LLM Reasoning via Adversarial Learning and Instructive Verbal Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05472</link><description>arXiv:2602.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05472v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LMMRec: LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05474</link><description>arXiv:2602.05474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation-based recommendation systems uncover user behavior drivers. Motivation modeling, crucial for decision-making and content preference, explains recommendation generation. Existing methods often treat motivation as latent variables from interaction data, neglecting heterogeneous information like review text. In multimodal motivation fusion, two challenges arise: 1) achieving stable cross-modal alignment amid noise, and 2) identifying features reflecting the same underlying motivation across modalities. To address these, we propose LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation (LMMRec), a model-agnostic framework leveraging large language models for deep semantic priors and motivation understanding. LMMRec uses chain-of-thought prompting to extract fine-grained user and item motivations from text. A dual-encoder architecture models textual and interaction-based motivations for cross-modal alignment, while Motivation Coordination Strategy and Interaction-Text Correspondence Method mitigate noise and semantic drift through contrastive learning and momentum updates. Experiments on three datasets show LMMRec achieves up to a 4.98\% performance improvement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05474v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tight FPT Approximations for Fair $k$-center with Outliers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05476</link><description>arXiv:2602.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-center problem is a fundamental clustering objective that has been extensively studied in approximation algorithms. Recent work has sought to incorporate modern constraints such as fairness and robustness, motivated by biased and noisy data. In this paper, we study fair $k$-center with outliers, where centers must respect group-based representation constraints while up to $z$ points may be discarded.
  While a bi-criteria FPT approximation was previously known, no true approximation algorithm was available for this problem. We present the first deterministic $3$-approximation algorithm running in fixed-parameter tractable time parameterized by $k$. Our approach departs from projection-based methods and instead directly constructs a fair solution using a novel iterative ball-finding framework, based on a structural trichotomy that enables fixed-parameter approximation for the problem.
  We further extend our algorithm to fair $k$-supplier with outliers and to the more general fair-range setting with both lower and upper bounds. Finally, we show that improving the approximation factor below $3$ is $\mathrm{W[2]}$-hard, establishing the optimality of our results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05476v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Phi-Former: A Pairwise Hierarchical Approach for Compound-Protein Interactions Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05479</link><description>arXiv:2602.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05479v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SOMA-1M: A Large-Scale SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment Dataset for Multi-Task Remote Sensing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05480</link><description>arXiv:2602.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery provide complementary strengths that constitute the critical foundation for transcending single-modality constraints and facilitating cross-modal collaborative processing and intelligent interpretation. However, existing benchmark datasets often suffer from limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy, making them inadequate for supporting the training and generalization of multi-scale foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce SOMA-1M (SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment), a pixel-level precisely aligned dataset containing over 1.3 million pairs of georeferenced images with a specification of 512 x 512 pixels. This dataset integrates imagery from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth, achieving global multi-scale coverage from 0.5 m to 10 m. It encompasses 12 typical land cover categories, effectively ensuring scene diversity and complexity. To address multimodal projection deformation and massive data registration, we designed a rigorous coarse-to-fine image matching framework ensuring pixel-level alignment. Based on this dataset, we established comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for four hierarchical vision tasks, including image matching, image fusion, SAR-assisted cloud removal, and cross-modal translation, involving over 30 mainstream algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks. Notably, multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching performance achieves current state-of-the-art (SOTA) levels. SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models. The dataset will be released publicly at: https://github.com/PeihaoWu/SOMA-1M.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05480v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Clouding the Mirror: Stealthy Prompt Injection Attacks Targeting LLM-based Phishing Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05484</link><description>arXiv:2602.05484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phishing sites continue to grow in volume and sophistication. Recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze URLs, HTML, and rendered content to decide whether a website is a phishing site. While these approaches are promising, LLMs are inherently vulnerable to prompt injection (PI). Because attackers can fully control various elements of phishing sites, this creates the potential for PI that exploits the perceptual asymmetry between LLMs and humans: instructions imperceptible to end users can still be parsed by the LLM and can stealthily manipulate its judgment. The specific risks of PI in phishing detection and effective mitigation strategies remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of PI against multimodal LLM-based phishing detection. We introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy, defined by Attack Techniques and Attack Surfaces, that captures realistic PI strategies. Using this taxonomy, we implement diverse attacks and empirically study several representative LLM-based detection systems. The results show that phishing detection with state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 remains vulnerable to PI. We then propose InjectDefuser, a defense framework that combines prompt hardening, allowlist-based retrieval augmentation, and output validation. Across multiple models, InjectDefuser significantly reduces attack success rates. Our findings clarify the PI risk landscape and offer practical defenses that improve the reliability of next-generation phishing countermeasures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05484v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Automatic Detection of Sexually Explicit Content in Spanish-Language Song Lyrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05485</link><description>arXiv:2602.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of sexually explicit content in popular music genres such as reggaeton and trap, consumed predominantly by young audiences, has raised significant societal concern regarding the exposure of minors to potentially harmful lyrical material. This paper presents an approach to the automatic detection of sexually explicit content in Spanish-language song lyrics by fine-tuning a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model on a curated corpus of 100 songs, evenly divided between expert-labeled explicit and non-explicit categories. The proposed methodology leverages transfer learning to adapt the pre-trained model to the idiosyncratic linguistic features of urban Latin music, including slang, metaphors, and culturally specific double entendres that evade conventional dictionary-based filtering systems. Experimental evaluation on held-out test sets demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves 87% accuracy, 100% precision, and 100% specificity after a feedback-driven refinement loop, outperforming both its pre-feedback configuration and a non-customized baseline ChatGPT model. A comparative analysis reveals that the fine-tuned model agrees with expert human classification in 59.2% of cases versus 55.1% for the standard model, confirming that domain-specific adaptation enhances sensitivity to implicit and culturally embedded sexual references. These findings support the viability of deploying fine-tuned large language models as automated content moderation tools on music streaming platforms. Building on these technical results, the paper develops a public policy proposal for a multi-tier age-based content rating system for music analogous to the PEGI system for video games analyzed through the PESTEL framework and Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework, establishing both the technological feasibility and the policy pathway for systematic music content regulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05485v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sovereign-by-Design A Reference Architecture for AI and Blockchain Enabled Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05486</link><description>arXiv:2602.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital sovereignty has emerged as a central concern for modern software-intensive systems, driven by the dominance of non-sovereign cloud infrastructures, the rapid adoption of Generative AI, and increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. While existing initiatives address governance, compliance, and security in isolation, they provide limited guidance on how sovereignty can be operationalized at the architectural level. In this paper, we argue that sovereignty must be treated as a first-class architectural property rather than a purely regulatory objective. We introduce a Sovereign Reference Architecture that integrates self-sovereign identity, blockchain-based trust and auditability, sovereign data governance, and Generative AI deployed under explicit architectural control. The architecture explicitly captures the dual role of Generative AI as both a source of governance risk and an enabler of compliance, accountability, and continuous assurance when properly constrained. By framing sovereignty as an architectural quality attribute, our work bridges regulatory intent and concrete system design, offering a coherent foundation for building auditable, evolvable, and jurisdiction-aware AI-enabled systems. The proposed reference architecture provides a principled starting point for future research and practice at the intersection of software architecture, Generative AI, and digital sovereignty.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05486v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wasure: A Modular Toolkit for Comprehensive WebAssembly Benchmarking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05488</link><description>arXiv:2602.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WebAssembly (Wasm) has become a key compilation target for portable and efficient execution across diverse platforms. Benchmarking its performance, however, is a multi-dimensional challenge: it depends not only on the choice of runtime engines, but also on hardware architectures, application domains, source languages, benchmark suites, and runtime configurations. This paper introduces Wasure, a modular and extensible command-line toolkit that simplifies the execution and comparison of WebAssembly benchmarks. To complement performance evaluation, we also conducted a dynamic analysis of the benchmark suites included with Wasure. Our analysis reveals substantial differences in code coverage, control flow, and execution patterns, emphasizing the need for benchmark diversity. Wasure aims to support researchers and developers in conducting more systematic, transparent, and insightful evaluations of WebAssembly engines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05488v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Monte Carlo Rendering to Diffusion Curves with Differential BEM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05492</link><description>arXiv:2602.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for generating vector graphics, in the form of diffusion curves, directly from noisy samples produced by a Monte Carlo renderer. While generating raster images from 3D geometry via Monte Carlo raytracing is commonplace, there is no corresponding practical approach for robustly and directly extracting editable vector images with shading information from 3D geometry. To fill this gap, we formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization problem over the space of geometries and colors of diffusion curve handles, and solve it with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. At the core of our method is a novel differential boundary element method (BEM) framework that reconstructs colors from diffusion curve handles and computes gradients with respect to their parameters, requiring the expensive matrix factorization only once at the beginning of the optimization. Unlike triangulation-based techniques that require a clean domain decomposition, our method is robust to geometrically challenging scenarios, such as intersecting diffusion curves, and to color noise in the target image, enabling the direct use of noisy Monte Carlo samples without requiring a converged, error-free input image. We demonstrate the robustness and broad applicability of our approach across several test cases. Finally, we highlight several open questions raised by our work, which spans both theory and applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05492v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LinguistAgent: A Reflective Multi-Model Platform for Automated Linguistic Annotation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05493</link><description>arXiv:2602.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data annotation remains a significant bottleneck in the Humanities and Social Sciences, particularly for complex semantic tasks such as metaphor identification. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, a significant gap remains between the theoretical capability of LLMs and their practical utility for researchers. This paper introduces LinguistAgent, an integrated, user-friendly platform that leverages a reflective multi-model architecture to automate linguistic annotation. The system implements a dual-agent workflow, comprising an Annotator and a Reviewer, to simulate a professional peer-review process. LinguistAgent supports comparative experiments across three paradigms: Prompt Engineering (Zero/Few-shot), Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Fine-tuning. We demonstrate LinguistAgent's efficacy using the task of metaphor identification as an example, providing real-time token-level evaluation (Precision, Recall, and $F_1$ score) against human gold standards. The application and codes are released on https://github.com/Bingru-Li/LinguistAgent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05493v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Framework for Rethinking Policy Divergence Measures in GRPO</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05494</link><description>arXiv:2602.05494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05494v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transport and Merge: Cross-Architecture Merging for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05495</link><description>arXiv:2602.05495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong capabilities by scaling model capacity and training data, yet many real-world deployments rely on smaller models trained or adapted from low-resource data. This gap motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large, high-resource models to smaller, low-resource targets. While model merging provides an effective transfer mechanism, most existing approaches assume architecture-compatible models and therefore cannot directly transfer knowledge from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets. In this work, we propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models. The resulting transport plans are then used to guide direct weight-space fusion, enabling effective high-resource to low-resource transfer using only a small set of inputs. Extensive experiments across low-resource languages and specialized domains demonstrate consistent improvements over target models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05495v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] XEmoGPT: An Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition Framework with Cue-Level Perception and Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05496</link><description>arXiv:2602.05496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition plays a crucial role in applications such as human-computer interaction and social media analytics. However, current approaches struggle with cue-level perception and reasoning due to two main challenges: 1) general-purpose modality encoders are pretrained to capture global structures and general semantics rather than fine-grained emotional cues, resulting in limited sensitivity to emotional signals; and 2) available datasets usually involve a trade-off between annotation quality and scale, which leads to insufficient supervision for emotional cues and ultimately limits cue-level reasoning. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics are inadequate for assessing cue-level reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose eXplainable Emotion GPT (XEmoGPT), a novel EMER framework capable of both perceiving and reasoning over emotional cues. It incorporates two specialized modules: the Video Emotional Cue Bridge (VECB) and the Audio Emotional Cue Bridge (AECB), which enhance the video and audio encoders through carefully designed tasks for fine-grained emotional cue perception. To further support cue-level reasoning, we construct a large-scale dataset, EmoCue, designed to teach XEmoGPT how to reason over multimodal emotional cues. In addition, we introduce EmoCue-360, an automated metric that extracts and matches emotional cues using semantic similarity, and release EmoCue-Eval, a benchmark of 400 expert-annotated samples covering diverse emotional scenarios. Experimental results show that XEmoGPT achieves strong performance in both emotional cue perception and reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05496v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SDFP: Speculative Decoding with FIT-Pruned Models for Training-Free and Plug-and-Play LLM Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05499</link><description>arXiv:2602.05499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05499v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Repairing Property Graphs under PG-Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05503</link><description>arXiv:2602.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent standardization efforts for graph databases lead to standard query languages like GQL and SQL/PGQ, and constraint languages like Property Graph Constraints (PG-Constraints). In this paper, we embark on the study of repairing property graphs under PG-Constraints. We identify a significant subset of PG-Constraints, encoding denial constraints and including recursion as a key feature, while still permitting automata-based structural analyses of errors. We present a comprehensive repair pipeline for these constraints to repair Property Graphs, involving changes in the graph topology and leading to node, edge and, optionally, label deletions. We investigate three algorithmic strategies for the repair procedure, based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP), a naive, and an LP-guided greedy algorithm. Our experiments on various real-world datasets reveal that repairing with label deletions can achieve a 59% reduction in deletions compared to node/edge deletions. Moreover, the LP-guided greedy algorithm offers a runtime advantage of up to 97% compared to the ILP strategy, while matching the same quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05503v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Relying on LLMs: Student Practices and Instructor Norms are Changing in Computer Science Education</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05506</link><description>arXiv:2602.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior research has raised concerns about students' over-reliance on large language models (LLMs) in higher education. This paper examines how Computer Science students and instructors engage with LLMs across five scenarios: "Writing", "Quiz", "Programming", "Project-based learning", and "Information retrieval". Through user studies with 16 students and 6 instructors, we identify 7 key intents, including increasingly complex student practices. Findings reveal varying levels of conflict between student practices and instructor norms, ranging from clear conflict in "Writing-generation" and "(Programming) quiz-solving", through partial conflict in "Programming project-implementation" and "Project-based learning", to broad agreement in "Writing-revision &amp; ideation", "(Programming) quiz-correction" and "Info-query &amp; summary". We document instructors are shifting from prohibiting to recognizing students' use of LLMs for high-quality work, integrating usage records into assessment grading. Finally, we propose LLM design guidelines: deploying default guardrails with game-like and empathetic interaction to prevent students from "deserting" LLMs, especially for "Writing-generation", while utilizing comprehension checks in low-conflict intents to promote learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05506v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VGGT-Motion: Motion-Aware Calibration-Free Monocular SLAM for Long-Range Consistency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05508</link><description>arXiv:2602.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in calibration-free monocular SLAM via 3D vision foundation models, scale drift remains severe on long sequences. Motion-agnostic partitioning breaks contextual coherence and causes zero-motion drift, while conventional geometric alignment is computationally expensive. To address these issues, we propose VGGT-Motion, a calibration-free SLAM system for efficient and robust global consistency over kilometer-scale trajectories. Specifically, we first propose a motion-aware submap construction mechanism that uses optical flow to guide adaptive partitioning, prune static redundancy, and encapsulate turns for stable local geometry. We then design an anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy. By exploiting context-balanced anchors, it achieves search-free, pixel-wise dense alignment and efficient loop closure without costly feature matching. Finally, a lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization enforces global consistency with linear complexity, enabling scalable long-range operation. Experiments show that VGGT-Motion markedly improves trajectory accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, long-range calibration-free monocular SLAM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05508v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Statistical Verification of Medium-Access Parameterization for Power-Grid Edge Ad Hoc Sensor Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05510</link><description>arXiv:2602.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of power grid ad hoc sensor networks based on IEEE 802.15.4 raises reliability challenges when nodes selfishly adapt CSMA/CA parameters to maximize individual performance. Such behavior degrades reliability, energy efficiency, and compliance with strict grid constraints. Existing analytical and simulation approaches often fail to rigorously evaluate configurations under asynchronous, event-driven, and resource-limited conditions. We develop a verification framework that integrates stochastic timed hybrid automata with statistical model checking (SMC) with confidence bounds to formally assess CSMA/CA parameterizations under grid workloads. By encoding node- and system-level objectives in temporal logic and automating protocol screening via large-scale statistical evaluation, the method certifies Nash equilibrium strategies that remain robust to unilateral deviations. In a substation-scale scenario, the certified equilibrium improves utility from 0.862 to 0.914 and raises the delivery ratio from 89.5% to 93.2% when compared with an aggressive tuning baseline. Against a delivery-oriented baseline, it reduces mean per-cycle energy from 152.8 mJ to 149.2 mJ while maintaining comparable delivery performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but remain limited in knowledge-intensive domains due to hallucinations, outdated information, and limited explainability. Text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps ground model outputs in external sources but struggles with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), in contrast, support precise, explainable querying, yet require a knowledge of query languages. This work introduces an interactive framework in which LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries and users iteratively refine them through natural language. Applied to real-world KGs, the framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor and provides insight into how model performance varies across domains. Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05512v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DECO: Decoupled Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation with a Plugin Tactile Adapter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05513</link><description>arXiv:2602.05513v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Congressional stock trading has raised concerns about potential information asymmetries and conflicts of interest in financial markets. We introduce a temporal graph network (TGN) framework to identify information channels through which members of Congress may possess advantageous knowledge when trading company stocks. We construct a multimodal dynamic graph integrating diverse publicly available datasets, including congressional stock transactions, lobbying relationships, campaign finance contributions, and geographical connections between legislators and corporations. Our approach formulates the detection problem as a dynamic edge classification task, where we identify trades that exhibit statistically significant outperformance relative to the S&amp;amp;P 500 across long time horizons. To handle the temporal nature of these relationships, we develop a two-step walk-forward validation architecture that respects information availability constraints and prevents look-ahead bias. We evaluate several labeling strategies based on risk-adjusted returns and demonstrate that the TGN successfully captures complex temporal dependencies between congressional-corporate interactions and subsequent trading performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05514v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Multimodal Framework for Dataset Construction and Model-Based Diagnosis of Ameloblastoma</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05515</link><description>arXiv:2602.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05515v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Virtual-Tube-Based Cooperative Transport Control for Multi-UAV Systems in Constrained Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05516</link><description>arXiv:2602.05516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control framework for cooperative transportation of cable-suspended loads by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in constrained environments. Leveraging virtual tube theory and principles from dissipative systems theory, the framework facilitates efficient multi-UAV collaboration for navigating obstacle-rich areas. The proposed framework offers several key advantages. (1) It achieves tension distribution and coordinated transportation within the UAV-cable-load system with low computational overhead, dynamically adapting UAV configurations based on obstacle layouts to facilitate efficient navigation. (2) By integrating dissipative systems theory, the framework ensures high stability and robustness, essential for complex multi-UAV operations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulations, demonstrating its scalability for large-scale multi-UAV systems. Furthermore, the method is experimentally validated in outdoor scenarios, showcasing its practical feasibility and robustness under real-world conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05516v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GNSS SpAmming: a spoofing-based GNSS denial-of-service attack</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05517</link><description>arXiv:2602.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GNSSs are vulnerable to attacks of two kinds: jamming (i.e. denying access to the signal) and spoofing (i.e. impersonating a legitimate satellite). These attacks have been extensively studied, and we have a myriad of countermeasures to mitigate them. In this paper we expose a new type of attack: SpAmming, which combines both approaches to achieve the same effects in a more subtle way.
  Exploiting the CDMA multiplexing present in most GNSSs, and through a spoofing attack, this approach leads the receiver to lose access to the signal of a legitimate satellite, which would be equivalent to a denial of service; but in this case the existing countermeasures against jamming or spoofing would not allow safeguarding its effectiveness, as it is neither of them.
  An experimental proof-of-concept is presented in which its impact is evaluated as a function of the previous state of the receiver. Using an SDR-based system developed at the Space Security Centre, the attack is executed against a cold-started receiver, a warm-started receiver, and a receiver that has already acquired the PVT solution and is navigating. Different attack configurations are also tested, starting from a raw emission of the false signal, to surgical Doppler effect configuration, code offset, etc. Although it is shown to be particularly successful against cold-started receivers, the results show that it is also effective in other scenarios, especially if accompanied by other attacks. We will conclude the article by outlining possible countermeasures to detect and, eventually, counteract it; and possible avenues of research to better understand its impact, especially for authenticated services such as OSNMA, and to characterize it in order to improve the response to similar attacks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05517v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wikipedia and Grokipedia: A Comparison of Human and Generative Encyclopedias</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05519</link><description>arXiv:2602.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of Wikipedia and Grokipedia to examine how generative mediation alters content selection, textual rewriting, narrative structure, and evaluative framing in encyclopedic content. We model page inclusion in Grokipedia as a function of Wikipedia page popularity, density of reference, and recent editorial activity. Inclusion is non-uniform: pages with higher visibility and greater editorial conflict in Wikipedia are more likely to appear in Grokipedia. For included pages, we distinguish between verbatim reproduction and generative rewriting. Rewriting is more frequent for pages with higher reference density and recent controversy, while highly popular pages are more often reproduced without modification. We compare editing activity across the two platforms and estimate page complexity using a fitness-complexity framework to assess whether generative mediation alters patterns of editorial participation. To assess narrative organization, we construct actor-relation networks from article texts using abstract meaning representation. Across multiple topical domains, including U.S. politics, geopolitics, and conspiracy-related narratives, narrative structure remains largely consistent between the two sources. Analysis of lead sections shows broadly correlated framing, with localized shifts in laudatory and conflict-oriented language for some topics in Grokipedia. Overall, generative systems preserve the main structural organization of encyclopedic content, while affecting how content is selected, rewritten, and framed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05519v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Capture the Flags: Family-Based Evaluation of Agentic LLMs via Semantics-Preserving Transformations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05523</link><description>arXiv:2602.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on cybersecurity tasks using capture-the-flag (CTF) benchmarks. However, existing pointwise benchmarks have limited ability to shed light on the robustness and generalisation abilities of agents across alternative versions of the source code. We introduce CTF challenge families, whereby a single CTF is used as the basis for generating a family of semantically-equivalent challenges via semantics-preserving program transformations. This enables controlled evaluation of agent robustness to source code transformations while keeping the underlying exploit strategy fixed. We introduce a new tool, Evolve-CTF, that generates CTF families from Python challenges using a range of transformations. Using Evolve-CTF to derive families from Cybench and Intercode challenges, we evaluate 13 agentic LLM configurations with tool access. We find that models are remarkably robust to intrusive renaming and code insertion-based transformations, but that composed transformations and deeper obfuscation affect performance by requiring more sophisticated use of tools. We also find that enabling explicit reasoning has little effect on solution success rates across challenge families. Our work contributes a valuable technique and tool for future LLM evaluations, and a large dataset characterising the capabilities of current state-of-the-art models in this domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05523v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI Agent Systems for Supply Chains: Structured Decision Prompts and Memory Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05524</link><description>arXiv:2602.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates large language model (LLM) -based multi-agent systems (MASs) as a promising approach to inventory management, which is a key component of supply chain management. Although these systems have gained considerable attention for their potential to address the challenges associated with typical inventory management methods, key uncertainties regarding their effectiveness persist. Specifically, it is unclear whether LLM-based MASs can consistently derive optimal ordering policies and adapt to diverse supply chain scenarios. To address these questions, we examine an LLM-based MAS with a fixed-ordering strategy prompt that encodes the stepwise processes of the problem setting and a safe-stock strategy commonly used in inventory management. Our empirical results demonstrate that, even without detailed prompt adjustments, an LLM-based MAS can determine optimal ordering decisions in a restricted scenario. To enhance adaptability, we propose a novel agent called AIM-RM, which leverages similar historical experiences through similarity matching. Our results show that AIM-RM outperforms benchmark methods across various supply chain scenarios, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05524v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalization of Self-Supervised Vision Transformers for Protein Localization Across Microscopy Domains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05527</link><description>arXiv:2602.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-specific microscopy datasets are often too small to train deep learning models that learn robust feature representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can mitigate this by pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, but it remains unclear how well such representations transfer across microscopy domains with different staining protocols and channel configurations. We investigate the cross-domain transferability of DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers for protein localization on the OpenCell dataset. We generate image embeddings using three DINO backbones pretrained on ImageNet-1k, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and OpenCell, and evaluate them by training a supervised classification head on OpenCell labels. All pretrained models transfer well, with the microscopy-specific HPA-pretrained model achieving the best performance (mean macro $F_1$-score = 0.8221 \pm 0.0062), slightly outperforming a DINO model trained directly on OpenCell (0.8057 \pm 0.0090). These results highlight the value of large-scale pretraining and indicate that domain-relevant SSL representations can generalize effectively to related but distinct microscopy datasets, enabling strong downstream performance even when task-specific labeled data are limited.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Strong Normalisation for Asynchronous Effects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05528</link><description>arXiv:2602.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asynchronous effects of Ahman and Pretnar complement the conventional synchronous treatment of algebraic computational effects with asynchrony based on decoupling the execution of algebraic operation calls into signalling that an operation's implementation needs to be executed, and into interrupting a running computation with the operation's result, to which the computation can react by installing matching interrupt handlers. Beyond providing asynchrony for algebraic effects, the resulting core calculus also naturally models examples such as pre-emptive multi-threading, (cancellable) remote function calls, multi-party applications, and even a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects. In this paper, we study the normalisation properties of this calculus. We prove that if one removes general recursion from the original calculus, then the remaining calculus is strongly normalising, including both its sequential and parallel parts. However, this only guarantees termination for very simple asynchronous examples. To improve on this result, we also prove that the sequential fragment of the calculus remains strongly normalising when a controlled amount of interrupt-driven recursive behaviour is reintroduced. Our strong normalisation proofs are structured compositionally as a natural extension of Lindley and Stark's $\top\top$-lifting based approach for proving strong normalisation of effectful languages. All our results are also formalised in Agda.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05528v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Split Personality Training: Revealing Latent Knowledge Through Alternate Personalities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05532</link><description>arXiv:2602.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05532v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conditional Diffusion Guidance under Hard Constraint: A Stochastic Analysis Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05533</link><description>arXiv:2602.05533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05533v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SSG: Scaled Spatial Guidance for Multi-Scale Visual Autoregressive Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05534</link><description>arXiv:2602.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) models generate images through next-scale prediction, naturally achieving coarse-to-fine, fast, high-fidelity synthesis mirroring human perception. In practice, this hierarchy can drift at inference time, as limited capacity and accumulated error cause the model to deviate from its coarse-to-fine nature. We revisit this limitation from an information-theoretic perspective and deduce that ensuring each scale contributes high-frequency content not explained by earlier scales mitigates the train-inference discrepancy. With this insight, we propose Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence. SSG emphasizes target high-frequency signals, defined as the semantic residual, isolated from a coarser prior. To obtain this prior, we leverage a principled frequency-domain procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), which is devised to sharpen and better isolate the semantic residual through frequency-aware construction. SSG applies broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality. Experiments demonstrate SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective. The source code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/EUQ.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Comparative Study of 3D Person Detection: Sensor Modalities and Robustness in Diverse Indoor and Outdoor Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05538</link><description>arXiv:2602.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D person detection is critical for safety in applications such as robotics, industrial monitoring, and surveillance. This work presents a systematic evaluation of 3D person detection using camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. While most existing research focuses on autonomous driving, we explore detection performance and robustness in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes using the JRDB dataset. We compare three representative models - BEVDepth (camera), PointPillars (LiDAR), and DAL (camera-LiDAR fusion) - and analyze their behavior under varying occlusion and distance levels. Our results show that the fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, particularly in challenging scenarios. We further investigate robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments, revealing that while DAL offers improved resilience, it remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and certain LiDAR-based corruptions. In contrast, the camera-based BEVDepth model showed the lowest performance and was most affected by occlusion, distance, and noise. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing sensor fusion for enhanced 3D person detection, while also underscoring the need for ongoing research to address the vulnerabilities inherent in these systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05538v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Steering Large Reasoning Models towards Concise Reasoning via Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05539</link><description>arXiv:2602.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is often hampered by overly verbose outputs. Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines. Our work demonstrates that modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques offers a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05539v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Taking the Leap: Efficient and Reliable Fine-Grained NUMA Migration in User-space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05540</link><description>arXiv:2602.05540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern multi-socket architectures offer a single virtual address space, but physically divide main-memory across multiple regions, where each region is attached to a CPU and its cores. While this simplifies the usage, developers must be aware of non-uniform memory access (NUMA), where an access by a thread running on a core-local NUMA region is significantly cheaper than an access from a core-remote region. Obviously, if query answering is parallelized across the cores of multiple regions, then the portion of the database on which the query is operating should be distributed across the same regions to ensure local accesses. As the present data placement might not fit this, migrating pages from one NUMA region to another can be performed to improve the situation. To do so, different options exist: One option is to rely on automatic NUMA balancing integrated in Linux, which is steered by the observed access patterns and frequency. Another option is to actively trigger migration via the system call move_pages(). Unfortunately, both variants have significant downsides in terms of their feature set and performance. As an alternative, we propose a new user-space migration method called page_leap() that can perform page migration asynchronously at a high performance by exploiting features of the virtual memory subsystem. The method is (a) actively triggered by the user, (b) ensures that all pages are eventually migrated, (c) handles concurrent writes correctly, (d) supports pooled memory, (e) adaptively adjusts its migration granularity based on the workload, and (f) supports both small pages and huge pages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05540v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reasoning-guided Collaborative Filtering with Language Models for Explainable Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05544</link><description>arXiv:2602.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential for explainable recommendation systems but overlook collaborative signals, while prevailing methods treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, resulting in a memory footprint. We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\% in Sports and 4.59\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\% and 3.49\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\% in cold-start and 11.9\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\% in Beauty and 23.16\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Task GRPO: Reliable LLM Reasoning Across Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05547</link><description>arXiv:2602.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RL-based post-training with GRPO is widely used to improve large language models on individual reasoning tasks. However, real-world deployment requires reliable performance across diverse tasks. A straightforward multi-task adaptation of GRPO often leads to imbalanced outcomes, with some tasks dominating optimization while others stagnate. Moreover, tasks can vary widely in how frequently prompts yield zero advantages (and thus zero gradients), which further distorts their effective contribution to the optimization signal. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm that (i) dynamically adapts task weights to explicitly optimize worst-task performance and promote balanced progress across tasks, and (ii) introduces a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients reflect the adapted weights. Experiments on both 3-task and 9-task settings show that MT-GRPO consistently outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy. In particular, MT-GRPO achieves 16-28% and 6% absolute improvement on worst-task performance over standard GRPO and DAPO, respectively, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Moreover, MT-GRPO requires 50% fewer training steps to reach 50% worst-task accuracy in the 3-task setting, demonstrating substantially improved efficiency in achieving reliable performance across tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05547v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling Implicit Advantage Symmetry: Why GRPO Struggles with Exploration and Difficulty Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05548</link><description>arXiv:2602.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05548v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Logical Guidance for the Exact Composition of Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05549</link><description>arXiv:2602.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose LOGDIFF (Logical Guidance for the Exact Composition of Diffusion Models), a guidance framework for diffusion models that enables principled constrained generation with complex logical expressions at inference time.
  We study when exact score-based guidance for complex logical formulas can be obtained from guidance signals associated with atomic properties.
  First, we derive an exact Boolean calculus that provides a sufficient condition for exact logical guidance.
  Specifically, if a formula admits a circuit representation in which conjunctions combine conditionally independent subformulas and disjunctions combine subformulas that are either conditionally independent or mutually exclusive, exact logical guidance is achievable.
  In this case, the guidance signal can be computed exactly from atomic scores and posterior probabilities using an efficient recursive algorithm.
  Moreover, we show that, for commonly encountered classes of distributions, any desired Boolean formula is compilable into such a circuit representation.
  Second, by combining atomic guidance scores with posterior probability estimates, we introduce a hybrid guidance approach that bridges classifierguidance and classifier-free guidance, applicable to both compositional logical guidance and standard conditional generation.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple image and protein structure generation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05549v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ArkTS-CodeSearch: A Open-Source ArkTS Dataset for Code Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05550</link><description>arXiv:2602.05550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ArkTS is a core programming language in the OpenHarmony ecosystem, yet research on ArkTS code intelligence is hindered by the lack of public datasets and evaluation benchmarks. This paper presents a large-scale ArkTS dataset constructed from open-source repositories, targeting code retrieval and code evaluation tasks. We design a single-search task, where natural language comments are used to retrieve corresponding ArkTS functions. ArkTS repositories are crawled from GitHub and Gitee, and comment-function pairs are extracted using tree-sitter-arkts, followed by cross-platform deduplication and statistical analysis of ArkTS function types. We further evaluate all existing open-source code embedding models on the single-search task and perform fine-tuning using both ArkTS and TypeScript training datasets, resulting in a high-performing model for ArkTS code understanding. This work establishes the first systematic benchmark for ArkTS code retrieval. Both the dataset and our fine-tuned model will be released publicly and are available at https://huggingface.co/hreyulog/embedinggemma_arkts and https://huggingface.co/datasets/hreyulog/arkts-code-docstring,establishing the first systematic benchmark for ArkTS code retrieval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05550v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FastVMT: Eliminating Redundancy in Video Motion Transfer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05551</link><description>arXiv:2602.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video motion transfer aims to synthesize videos by generating visual content according to a text prompt while transferring the motion pattern observed in a reference video. Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05551v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VLN-Pilot: Large Vision-Language Model as an Autonomous Indoor Drone Operator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05552</link><description>arXiv:2602.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces VLN-Pilot, a novel framework in which a large Vision-and-Language Model (VLLM) assumes the role of a human pilot for indoor drone navigation. By leveraging the multimodal reasoning abilities of VLLMs, VLN-Pilot interprets free-form natural language instructions and grounds them in visual observations to plan and execute drone trajectories in GPS-denied indoor environments. Unlike traditional rule-based or geometric path-planning approaches, our framework integrates language-driven semantic understanding with visual perception, enabling context-aware, high-level flight behaviors with minimal task-specific engineering. VLN-Pilot supports fully autonomous instruction-following for drones by reasoning about spatial relationships, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic reactivity to unforeseen events. We validate our framework on a custom photorealistic indoor simulation benchmark and demonstrate the ability of the VLLM-driven agent to achieve high success rates on complex instruction-following tasks, including long-horizon navigation with multiple semantic targets. Experimental results highlight the promise of replacing remote drone pilots with a language-guided autonomous agent, opening avenues for scalable, human-friendly control of indoor UAVs in tasks such as inspection, search-and-rescue, and facility monitoring. Our results suggest that VLLM-based pilots may dramatically reduce operator workload while improving safety and mission flexibility in constrained indoor environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05552v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IndustryShapes: An RGB-D Benchmark dataset for 6D object pose estimation of industrial assembly components and tools</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05555</link><description>arXiv:2602.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce IndustryShapes, a new RGB-D benchmark dataset of industrial tools and components, designed for both instance-level and novel object 6D pose estimation approaches. The dataset provides a realistic and application-relevant testbed for benchmarking these methods in the context of industrial robotics bridging the gap between lab-based research and deployment in real-world manufacturing scenarios. Unlike many previous datasets that focus on household or consumer products or use synthetic, clean tabletop datasets, or objects captured solely in controlled lab environments, IndustryShapes introduces five new object types with challenging properties, also captured in realistic industrial assembly settings. The dataset has diverse complexity, from simple to more challenging scenes, with single and multiple objects, including scenes with multiple instances of the same object and it is organized in two parts: the classic set and the extended set. The classic set includes a total of 4,6k images and 6k annotated poses. The extended set introduces additional data modalities to support the evaluation of model-free and sequence-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, IndustryShapes is the first dataset to offer RGB-D static onboarding sequences. We further evaluate the dataset on a representative set of state-of-the art methods for instance-based and novel object 6D pose estimation, including also object detection, segmentation, showing that there is room for improvement in this domain.

Abstract: We present PIRATR, an end-to-end 3D object detection framework for robotic use cases in point clouds. Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adjusted according to simple, predefined rules. The architecture employs modular, class-specific heads, making it straightforward to extend to novel object types without re-designing the pipeline. We validate PIRATR on an automated forklift platform, focusing on three structurally and functionally diverse categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in a synthetic environment, PIRATR generalizes effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919 without additional fine-tuning. PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception. This bridges the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models, paving the way for scalable, simulation-trained perception systems that can be deployed in dynamic robotic environments.

Abstract: Path marginal cost (PMC) is a crucial component in solving path-based system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA), dynamic origin-destination demand estimation (DODE), and network resilience analysis. However, accurately evaluating PMC in heterogeneous traffic conditions poses significant challenges. Previous studies often focus on homogeneous traffic flow of single vehicle class and do not well address the interactive effect of heterogeneous traffic flows and the resultant computational issues. This study proposes a novel but simple method for approximately evaluating PMC in complex heterogeneous traffic condition. The method decomposes PMC into intra-class and inter-class terms and uses conversion factor derived from heterogeneous link dynamics to explicitly model the intricate relationships between vehicle classes. Additionally, the method considers the non-differentiable issue that arises when mixed traffic flow approaches system optimum conditions. The proposed method is tested on a small corridor network with synthetic demand and a large-scale network with calibrated demand from real-world data. Results demonstrated that our method exhibits superior performance in solving bi-class SO-DTA problems, yielding lower total travel cost and capturing the multi-class flow competition at the system optimum state.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05565v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MAGPrompt: Message-Adaptive Graph Prompt Tuning for Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05567</link><description>arXiv:2602.05567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) transfer well, but adapting them to downstream tasks remains challenging due to mismatches between pre-training objectives and task requirements. Graph prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, yet most methods only modify inputs or representations and leave message passing unchanged, limiting their ability to adapt neighborhood interactions. We propose message-adaptive graph prompt tuning, which injects learnable prompts into the message passing step to reweight incoming neighbor messages and add task-specific prompt vectors during message aggregation, while keeping the backbone GNN frozen. The approach is compatible with common GNN backbones and pre-training strategies, and applicable across downstream settings. Experiments on diverse node- and graph-level datasets show consistent gains over prior graph prompting methods in few-shot settings, while achieving performance competitive with fine-tuning in full-shot regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05567v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TangramSR: Can Vision-Language Models Reason in Continuous Geometric Space?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05570</link><description>arXiv:2602.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans excel at spatial reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzle assembly through cognitive processes involving mental rotation, iterative refinement, and visual feedback. Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

Abstract: Structural shifts pose a significant challenge for graph neural networks, as graph topology acts as a covariate that can vary across domains. Existing domain generalization methods rely on fixed structural augmentations or training on globally perturbed graphs, mechanisms that do not pinpoint which specific edges encode domain-invariant information. We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph. This enriched graph combines the original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing the model to discover invariances even when the original topology is noisy or domain-specific. EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs. We provide a formal justification for our approach from a robust optimization perspective. We demonstrate that EdgeMask-DG* achieves new state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks, including citation networks, social networks, and temporal graphs. Notably, on the Cora OOD benchmark, EdgeMask-DG* lifts the worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0\%, a +3.8 pp improvement over the prior state of the art (74.2\%).

Abstract: We introduce ShapeGaussian, a high-fidelity, template-free method for 4D human reconstruction from casual monocular videos. Generic reconstruction methods lacking robust vision priors, such as 4DGS, struggle to capture high-deformation human motion without multi-view cues. While template-based approaches, primarily relying on SMPL, such as HUGS, can produce photorealistic results, they are highly susceptible to errors in human pose estimation, often leading to unrealistic artifacts. In contrast, ShapeGaussian effectively integrates template-free vision priors to achieve both high-fidelity and robust scene reconstructions. Our method follows a two-step pipeline: first, we learn a coarse, deformable geometry using pretrained models that estimate data-driven priors, providing a foundation for reconstruction. Then, we refine this geometry using a neural deformation model to capture fine-grained dynamic details. By leveraging 2D vision priors, we mitigate artifacts from erroneous pose estimation in template-based methods and employ multiple reference frames to resolve the invisibility issue of 2D keypoints in a template-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShapeGaussian surpasses template-based methods in reconstruction accuracy, achieving superior visual quality and robustness across diverse human motions in casual monocular videos.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05572v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer for Autonomous Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05573</link><description>arXiv:2602.05573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer (ViGT), an autonomous driving geometric model that estimates continuous 3D occupancy fields from surround-view camera rigs. ViGT represents a step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, prioritizing scalability, architectural simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations. Our approach achieves this through a calibration-free architecture, enabling a single model to adapt to different sensor setups. Unlike general-purpose geometric foundational models that focus on pixel-aligned predictions, ViGT estimates a continuous 3D occupancy field in a birds-eye-view (BEV) addressing domain-specific requirements. ViGT naturally infers geometry from multiple camera views into a single metric coordinate frame, providing a common representation for multiple geometric tasks. Unlike most existing occupancy models, we adopt a self-supervised training procedure that leverages synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, eliminating the need for costly manual annotations. We validate the scalability and generalizability of our approach by training our model on a mixture of five large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NuScenes, Waymo, NuPlan, ONCE, and Argoverse) and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the pointmap estimation task, with the best average rank across all evaluated baselines. We further evaluate ViGT on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, where ViGT achieves comparable performance with supervised methods.

Abstract: Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders (APD), also known as Parkinson-plus syndrome, are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In the early stages, overlapping clinical features often lead to misdiagnosis as Parkinson's disease (PD). Identifying reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis remains a critical challenge. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning (ML) techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between the subtypes themselves: PSP vs. PD, MSA vs. PD, and PSP vs. MSA. The model leverages multi-modal input data, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures associated with APD, and their corresponding volumetric measurements. By integrating these complementary modalities, including image data, structural segmentation masks, and quantitative volume features, the hybrid approach achieved promising classification performance with area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA. These results highlight the potential of combining spatial and structural information for robust subtype differentiation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs improves classification accuracy for APD subtypes. The proposed approach may contribute to more reliable early-stage diagnosis, facilitating timely and targeted interventions in clinical practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05574v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OpenMAG: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal-Attributed Graph</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05576</link><description>arXiv:2602.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal-Attributed Graph (MAG) learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling complex real-world systems by integrating graph topology with rich attributes from multiple modalities. With the rapid proliferation of novel MAG models capable of handling intricate cross-modal semantics and structural dependencies, establishing a rigorous and unified evaluation standard has become imperative. Although existing benchmarks have facilitated initial progress, they exhibit critical limitations in domain coverage, encoder flexibility, model diversity, and task scope, presenting significant challenges to fair evaluation. To bridge this gap, we present OpenMAG, a comprehensive benchmark that integrates 19 datasets across 6 domains and incorporates 16 encoders to support both static and trainable feature encoding. OpenMAG further implements a standardized library of 24 state-of-the-art models and supports 8 downstream tasks, enabling fair comparisons within a unified framework. Through systematic assessment of necessity, data quality, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency, we derive 14 fundamental insights into MAG learning to guide future advancements.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image editing have enabled highly controllable and semantically-aware alteration of visual content, posing unprecedented challenges to manipulation localization. However, existing AI-generated forgery localization methods primarily focus on inpainting-based manipulations, making them ineffective against the latest instruction-based editing paradigms. To bridge this critical gap, we propose LocateEdit-Bench, a large-scale dataset comprising $231$K edited images, designed specifically to benchmark localization methods against instruction-driven image editing. Our dataset incorporates four cutting-edge editing models and covers three common edit types. We conduct a detailed analysis of the dataset and develop two multi-metric evaluation protocols to assess existing localization methods. Our work establishes a foundation to keep pace with the evolving landscape of image editing, thereby facilitating the development of effective methods for future forgery localization.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) extends traditional closed-set segmentation by enabling pixel-wise annotation for both seen and unseen categories using arbitrary textual descriptions. While existing methods leverage vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, their reliance on image-level pretraining often results in imprecise spatial alignment, leading to mismatched segmentations in ambiguous or cluttered scenes. However, most existing approaches lack strong object priors and region-level constraints, which can lead to object hallucination or missed detections, further degrading performance. To address these challenges, we propose LoGoSeg, an efficient single-stage framework that integrates three key innovations: (i) an object existence prior that dynamically weights relevant categories through global image-text similarity, effectively reducing hallucinations; (ii) a region-aware alignment module that establishes precise region-level visual-textual correspondences; and (iii) a dual-stream fusion mechanism that optimally combines local structural information with global semantic context. Unlike prior works, LoGoSeg eliminates the need for external mask proposals, additional backbones, or extra datasets, ensuring efficiency. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks (A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, PAS-20, and PAS-20b) demonstrate its competitive performance and strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05578v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Geometric Observability Index: An Operator-Theoretic Framework for Per-Feature Sensitivity, Weak Observability, and Dynamic Effects in SE(3) Pose Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05582</link><description>arXiv:2602.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on the Lie group SE(3). Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3).
  The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace. GOI admits a spectral decomposition along the principal directions of the observable curvature, revealing a direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In the population regime, GOI coincides with the Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding a single-measurement analogue of the Cramer-Rao bound.
  The same spectral mechanism explains classical degeneracies such as pure rotation and vanishing parallax, as well as dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions. Overall, GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator. Because these quantities arise directly within Gauss-Newton pipelines, the curvature spectrum and GOI also yield lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05582v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fairness-aware design of nudging policies under stochasticity and prejudices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05584</link><description>arXiv:2602.05584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an injustice-aware innovation-diffusion model extending the Generalized Linear Threshold framework by assigning agents activation thresholds drawn from a Beta distribution to capture the stochastic nature of adoption shaped by inequalities. Because incentive policies themselves can inadvertently amplify these inequalities, building on this model, we design a fair Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that incorporates equality and equity objectives for allocating incentives.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized controller for large-scale heterogeneous multi-agent systems subject to bounded external disturbances, where agents must satisfy Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications requiring cooperation among non-communicating agents. To address the lack of direct communication, we employ a decentralized k-hop Prescribed Performance State Observer (k-hop PPSO) to provide each agent with state estimates of those agents it cannot communicate with. By leveraging the performance bounds on the state estimation errors guaranteed by the k-hop PPSO, we first modify the space robustness of the STL tasks to account for these errors, and then exploit the modified robustness to design a decentralized continuous-time feedback controller that ensures satisfaction of the STL tasks even under worst-case estimation errors. A simulation result is provided to validate the proposed framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05586v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Taylor-Accelerated Neural Network Interpolation Operators on Irregular Grids with Higher Order Approximation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05589</link><description>arXiv:2602.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new class of \emph{Taylor-accelerated neural network interpolation operators} is introduced on quasi-uniform irregular grids. These operators improve existing neural network interpolation operators by incorporating Taylor polynomials at the sampling nodes, thereby exploiting the higher smoothness of the target function. The proposed operators are shown to be well defined, uniformly bounded, and to satisfy an exact interpolation property at the grid points. In addition, polynomial reproduction up to a prescribed degree is established. Direct approximation estimates are derived in terms of higher-order moduli of smoothness, yielding enhanced convergence rates for sufficiently smooth functions. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the significant accuracy improvement achieved through the Taylor-accelerated construction. In particular, higher-order convergence on irregular grids is obtained, and the proposed approach outperforms existing neural network interpolation operators on irregular partitions, including Lagrange-based schemes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EgoPoseVR: Spatiotemporal Multi-Modal Reasoning for Egocentric Full-Body Pose in Virtual Reality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05590</link><description>arXiv:2602.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications demand accurate, temporally coherent full-body pose tracking. Recent head-mounted camera-based approaches show promise in egocentric pose estimation, but encounter challenges when applied to VR head-mounted displays (HMDs), including temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and the lack of real-time performance. To address these limitations, we present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline. A spatiotemporal encoder extracts frame- and joint-level representations, which are fused via cross-attention to fully exploit complementary motion cues across modalities. A kinematic optimization module then imposes constraints from HMD signals, enhancing the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1.8 million temporally aligned HMD and RGB-D frames across diverse VR scenarios. Experimental results show that EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models. A user study in real-world scenes further shows that EgoPoseVR achieved significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baseline methods. These results show that EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05590v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Learning for Contextualized NetFlow-Based Network Intrusion Detection: Methods, Data, Evaluation and Deployment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05594</link><description>arXiv:2602.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have progressively shifted from signature-based techniques toward machine learning and, more recently, deep learning methods. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of encryption has reduced payload visibility, weakening inspection pipelines that depend on plaintext content and increasing reliance on flow-level telemetry such as NetFlow and IPFIX. Many current learning-based detectors still frame intrusion detection as per-flow classification, implicitly treating each flow record as an independent sample. This assumption is often violated in realistic attack campaigns, where evidence is distributed across multiple flows and hosts, spanning minutes to days through staged execution, beaconing, lateral movement, and exfiltration. This paper synthesizes recent research on context-aware deep learning for flow-based intrusion detection. We organize existing methods into a four-dimensional taxonomy covering temporal context, graph or relational context, multimodal context, and multi-resolution context. Beyond modeling, we emphasize rigorous evaluation and operational realism. We review common failure modes that can inflate reported results, including temporal leakage, data splitting, dataset design flaws, limited dataset diversity, and weak cross-dataset generalization. We also analyze practical constraints that shape deployability, such as streaming state management, memory growth, latency budgets, and model compression choices. Overall, the literature suggests that context can meaningfully improve detection when attacks induce measurable temporal or relational structure, but the magnitude and reliability of these gains depend strongly on rigorous, causal evaluation and on datasets that capture realistic diversity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05594v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emulating Aggregate Human Choice Behavior and Biases with GPT Conversational Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05597</link><description>arXiv:2602.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05597v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CAViT -- Channel-Aware Vision Transformer for Dynamic Feature Fusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05598</link><description>arXiv:2602.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a range of computer vision tasks by modeling long-range spatial interactions via self-attention. However, channel-wise mixing in ViTs remains static, relying on fixed multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that lack adaptability to input content. We introduce 'CAViT', a dual-attention architecture that replaces the static MLP with a dynamic, attention-based mechanism for feature interaction. Each Transformer block in CAViT performs spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention, allowing the model to dynamically recalibrate feature representations based on global image context. This unified and content-aware token mixing strategy enhances representational expressiveness without increasing depth or complexity. We validate CAViT across five benchmark datasets spanning both natural and medical domains, where it outperforms the standard ViT baseline by up to +3.6% in accuracy, while reducing parameter count and FLOPs by over 30%. Qualitative attention maps reveal sharper and semantically meaningful activation patterns, validating the effectiveness of our attention-driven token mixing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05598v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BhashaSetu: Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer from High-Resource to Extreme Low-Resource Languages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05599</link><description>arXiv:2602.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in natural language processing, developing effective systems for low-resource languages remains a formidable challenge, with performances typically lagging far behind high-resource counterparts due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05599v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Superlinear Relationship between SGD Noise Covariance and Loss Landscape Curvature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05600</link><description>arXiv:2602.05600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) introduces anisotropic noise that is correlated with the local curvature of the loss landscape, thereby biasing optimization toward flat minima. Prior work often assumes an equivalence between the Fisher Information Matrix and the Hessian for negative log-likelihood losses, leading to the claim that the SGD noise covariance $\mathbf{C}$ is proportional to the Hessian $\mathbf{H}$. We show that this assumption holds only under restrictive conditions that are typically violated in deep neural networks. Using the recently discovered Activity--Weight Duality, we find a more general relationship agnostic to the specific loss formulation, showing that $\mathbf{C} \propto \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p^2]$, where $\mathbf{h}_p$ denotes the per-sample Hessian with $\mathbf{H} = \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p]$. As a consequence, $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ commute approximately rather than coincide exactly, and their diagonal elements follow an approximate power-law relation $C_{ii} \propto H_{ii}^{\gamma}$ with a theoretically bounded exponent $1 \leq \gamma \leq 2$, determined by per-sample Hessian spectra. Experiments across datasets, architectures, and loss functions validate these bounds, providing a unified characterization of the noise-curvature relationship in deep learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05600v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Shiva-DiT: Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection for Efficient Diffusion Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05605</link><description>arXiv:2602.05605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) incur prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and the strict static budgets required for hardware overhead. To address this, we propose Shiva-DiT, which effectively reconciles these conflicting requirements via Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection. By leveraging a residual-aware straight-through estimator, our method enforces deterministic token counts for static compilation while preserving end-to-end learnability through residual gradient estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to autonomously learn an adaptive pruning schedule. Experiments on mainstream models, including SD3.5, demonstrate that Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54$\times$ wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05605v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HiCrowd: Hierarchical Crowd Flow Alignment for Dense Human Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05608</link><description>arXiv:2602.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating through dense human crowds remains a significant challenge for mobile robots. A key issue is the freezing robot problem, where the robot struggles to find safe motions and becomes stuck within the crowd. To address this, we propose HiCrowd, a hierarchical framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with model predictive control (MPC). HiCrowd leverages surrounding pedestrian motion as guidance, enabling the robot to align with compatible crowd flows. A high-level RL policy generates a follow point to align the robot with a suitable pedestrian group, while a low-level MPC safely tracks this guidance with short horizon planning. The method combines long-term crowd aware decision making with safe short-term execution. We evaluate HiCrowd against reactive and learning-based baselines in offline setting (replaying recorded human trajectories) and online setting (human trajectories are updated to react to the robot in simulation). Experiments on a real-world dataset and a synthetic crowd dataset show that our method outperforms in navigation efficiency and safety, while reducing freezing behaviors. Our results suggest that leveraging human motion as guidance, rather than treating humans solely as dynamic obstacles, provides a powerful principle for safe and efficient robot navigation in crowds.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05608v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ADCA: Attention-Driven Multi-Party Collusion Attack in Federated Self-Supervised Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05612</link><description>arXiv:2602.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) integrates the privacy advantages of distributed training with the capability of self-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data, showing strong potential across applications. However, recent studies have shown that FSSL is also vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attacks are limited by their trigger design, which typically employs a global, uniform trigger that is easily detected, gets diluted during aggregation, and lacks robustness in heterogeneous client environments. To address these challenges, we propose the Attention-Driven multi-party Collusion Attack (ADCA). During local pre-training, malicious clients decompose the global trigger to find optimal local patterns. Subsequently, these malicious clients collude to form a malicious coalition and establish a collaborative optimization mechanism within it. In this mechanism, each submits its model updates, and an attention mechanism dynamically aggregates them to explore the best cooperative strategy. The resulting aggregated parameters serve as the initial state for the next round of training within the coalition, thereby effectively mitigating the dilution of backdoor information by benign updates. Experiments on multiple FSSL scenarios and four datasets show that ADCA significantly outperforms existing methods in Attack Success Rate (ASR) and persistence, proving its effectiveness and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05612v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Path-Guided Flow Matching for Dataset Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05616</link><description>arXiv:2602.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic sets with comparable performance in training models. Despite recent progress on diffusion-based distillation, this type of method typically depends on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, which comes with time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability and thus hurts downstream generalization especially under strong control or low IPC. We propose \emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\% mode coverage.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05616v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unified Sensor Simulation for Autonomous Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05617</link><description>arXiv:2602.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce \textbf{XSIM}, a sensor simulation framework for autonomous driving. XSIM extends 3DGUT splatting with a generalized rolling-shutter modeling tailored for autonomous driving applications. Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet. Our framework consistently outperforms strong recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

Abstract: Mode-dependent architectural components (layers that behave differently during training and evaluation, such as Batch Normalization or dropout) are commonly used in visual reinforcement learning but can destabilize on-policy optimization. We show that in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), discrepancies between training and evaluation behavior induced by Batch Normalization lead to policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse. We propose Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without architectural changes. Experiments across procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks demonstrate that MDR consistently improves stability and performance, and extends naturally to other mode-dependent layers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05619v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reactive Knowledge Representation and Asynchronous Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05625</link><description>arXiv:2602.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05625v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI chatbots versus human healthcare professionals: a systematic review and meta-analysis of empathy in patient care</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05628</link><description>arXiv:2602.05628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Empathy is widely recognized for improving patient outcomes, including reduced pain and anxiety and improved satisfaction, and its absence can cause harm. Meanwhile, use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots in healthcare is rapidly expanding, with one in five general practitioners using generative AI to assist with tasks such as writing letters. Some studies suggest AI chatbots can outperform human healthcare professionals (HCPs) in empathy, though findings are mixed and lack synthesis.
  Sources of data: We searched multiple databases for studies comparing AI chatbots using large language models with human HCPs on empathy measures. We assessed risk of bias with ROBINS-I and synthesized findings using random-effects meta-analysis where feasible, whilst avoiding double counting.
  Areas of agreement: We identified 15 studies (2023-2024). Thirteen studies reported statistically significantly higher empathy ratings for AI, with only two studies situated in dermatology favouring human responses. Of the 15 studies, 13 provided extractable data and were suitable for pooling. Meta-analysis of those 13 studies, all utilising ChatGPT-3.5/4, showed a standardized mean difference of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.54-1.20) favouring AI (P &lt; .00001), roughly equivalent to a two-point increase on a 10-point scale.
  Areas of controversy: Studies relied on text-based assessments that overlook non-verbal cues and evaluated empathy through proxy raters.
  Growing points: Our findings indicate that, in text-only scenarios, AI chatbots are frequently perceived as more empathic than human HCPs.
  Areas timely for developing research: Future research should validate these findings with direct patient evaluations and assess whether emerging voice-enabled AI systems can deliver similar empathic advantages.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05628v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ROMAN: Reward-Orchestrated Multi-Head Attention Network for Autonomous Driving System Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05629</link><description>arXiv:2602.05629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Driving System (ADS) acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles, responsible for their safety and efficiency. Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05629v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rewards as Labels: Revisiting RLVR from a Classification Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05630</link><description>arXiv:2602.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has recently advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models in complex reasoning tasks by providing explicit rule-based supervision. Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05630v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CASTLE: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Student-Tailored Personalized Safety in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05633</link><description>arXiv:2602.05633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of personalized learning in education. However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios. We further design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, measuring the model ability to detect risks; Emotional Empathy, evaluating the model capacity to recognize student states; and Student Alignment, assessing the match between model responses and student attributes. Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge: all models scored below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05633v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structural Disentanglement in Bilinear MLPs via Architectural Inductive Bias</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05635</link><description>arXiv:2602.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective unlearning and long-horizon extrapolation remain fragile in modern neural networks, even when tasks have underlying algebraic structure. In this work, we argue that these failures arise not solely from optimization or unlearning algorithms, but from how models structure their internal representations during training. We explore if having explicit multiplicative interactions as an architectural inductive bias helps in structural disentanglement, through Bilinear MLPs. We show analytically that bilinear parameterizations possess a `non-mixing' property under gradient flow conditions, where functional components separate into orthogonal subspace representations. This provides a mathematical foundation for surgical model modification. We validate this hypothesis through a series of controlled experiments spanning modular arithmetic, cyclic reasoning, Lie group dynamics, and targeted unlearning benchmarks. Unlike pointwise nonlinear networks, multiplicative architectures are able to recover true operators aligned with the underlying algebraic structure. Our results suggest that model editability and generalization are constrained by representational structure, and that architectural inductive bias plays a central role in enabling reliable unlearning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05635v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative Ontology: When Structured Knowledge Learns to Create</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05636</link><description>arXiv:2602.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.
  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.
  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.
  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05636v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniSurg: A Video-Native Foundation Model for Universal Understanding of Surgical Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05638</link><description>arXiv:2602.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While foundation models have advanced surgical video analysis, current approaches rely predominantly on pixel-level reconstruction objectives that waste model capacity on low-level visual details - such as smoke, specular reflections, and fluid motion - rather than semantic structures essential for surgical understanding. We present UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that shifts the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction. Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation. These results establish UniSurg as a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05638v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Joint Embedding Variational Bayes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05639</link><description>arXiv:2602.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Variational Joint Embedding (VJE), a framework that synthesizes joint embedding and variational inference to enable self-supervised learning of probabilistic representations in a reconstruction-free, non-contrastive setting. Compared to energy-based predictive objectives that optimize pointwise discrepancies, VJE maximizes a symmetric conditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) for a latent-variable model defined directly on encoder embeddings. We instantiate the conditional likelihood with a heavy-tailed Student-$t$ model using a polar decomposition that explicitly decouples directional and radial factors to prevent norm-induced instabilities during training. VJE employs an amortized inference network to parameterize a diagonal Gaussian variational posterior whose feature-wise variances are shared with the likelihood scale to capture anisotropic uncertainty without auxiliary projection heads. Across ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10/100, and STL-10, VJE achieves performance comparable to standard non-contrastive baselines under linear and k-NN evaluation. We further validate these probabilistic semantics through one-class CIFAR-10 anomaly detection, where likelihood-based scoring under the proposed model outperforms comparable self-supervised baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05639v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Time-Complexity Characterization of NIST Lightweight Cryptography Finalists</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05641</link><description>arXiv:2602.05641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight cryptography is becoming essential as emerging technologies in digital identity systems and Internet of Things verification continue to demand strong cryptographic assurance on devices with limited processing power, memory, and energy resources. As these technologies move into routine use, they demand cryptographic primitives that maintain strong security and deliver predictable performance through clear theoretical models of time complexity. Although NIST's lightweight cryptography project provides empirical evaluations of the ten finalist algorithms, a unified theoretical understanding of their time-complexity behavior remains absent. This work introduces a symbolic model that decomposes each scheme into initialization, data-processing, and finalization phases, enabling formal time-complexity derivation for all ten finalists. The results clarify how design parameters shape computational scaling on constrained mobile and embedded environments. The framework provides a foundation needed to distinguish algorithmic efficiency and guides the choice of primitives capable of supporting security systems in constrained environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05641v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UAV Trajectory Optimization via Improved Noisy Deep Q-Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05644</link><description>arXiv:2602.05644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an Improved Noisy Deep Q-Network (Noisy DQN) to enhance the exploration and stability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) when applying deep reinforcement learning in simulated environments. This method enhances the exploration ability by combining the residual NoisyLinear layer with an adaptive noise scheduling mechanism, while improving training stability through smooth loss and soft target network updates.

Abstract: While existing time series foundation models primarily rely on large-scale unimodal pretraining, they lack complementary modalities to enhance time series understanding. Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05646v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Modelling the Morphology of Verbal Paradigms: A Case Study in the Tokenization of Turkish and Hebrew</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05648</link><description>arXiv:2602.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew, concentrating on how tokenization strategies shape this ability. Using the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural data, we show that for Turkish -- with its transparent morphological markers -- both monolingual and multilingual models succeed, either when tokenization is atomic or when it breaks words into small subword units. For Hebrew, instead, monolingual and multilingual models diverge. A multilingual model using character-level tokenization fails to capture the language non-concatenative morphology, but a monolingual model with morpheme-aware segmentation performs well. Performance improves on more synthetic datasets, in all models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05648v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] End-to-End Compression for Tabular Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05649</link><description>arXiv:2602.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees for tabular data has recently been challenged by in-context learning tabular foundation models. In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation. Lastly, our method not only scales better with increased dataset sizes, but it also achieves better performance compared to other baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05649v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Personality Recognition by Comparing the Predictive Power of Traits, Facets, and Nuances</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05650</link><description>arXiv:2602.05650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personality is a complex, hierarchical construct typically assessed through item-level questionnaires aggregated into broad trait scores. Personality recognition models aim to infer personality traits from different sources of behavioral data. However, reliance on broad trait scores as ground truth, combined with limited training data, poses challenges for generalization, as similar trait scores can manifest through diverse, context dependent behaviors. In this work, we explore the predictive impact of the more granular hierarchical levels of the Big-Five Personality Model, facets and nuances, to enhance personality recognition from audiovisual interaction data. Using the UDIVA v0.5 dataset, we trained a transformer-based model including cross-modal (audiovisual) and cross-subject (dyad-aware) attention mechanisms. Results show that nuance-level models consistently outperform facet and trait-level models, reducing mean squared error by up to 74% across interaction scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05650v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One Size Does NOT Fit All: On the Importance of Physical Representations for Datalog Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05651</link><description>arXiv:2602.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Datalog is an increasingly popular recursive query language that is declarative by design, meaning its programs must be translated by an engine into the actual physical execution plan. When generating this plan, a central decision is how to physically represent all involved relations, an aspect in which existing Datalog engines are surprisingly restrictive and often resort to one-size-fits-all solutions. The reason for this is that the typical execution plan of a Datalog program not only performs a single type of operation against the physical representations, but a mixture of operations, such as insertions, lookups, and containment-checks. Further, the relevance of each operation type highly depends on the workload characteristics, which range from familiar properties such as the size, multiplicity, and arity of the individual relations to very specific Datalog properties, such as the "interweaving" of rules when relations occur multiple times, and in particular the recursiveness of the query which might generate new tuples on the fly during evaluation. This indicates that a variety of physical representations, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, is required to meet the specific needs of different workload situations. To evaluate this, we conduct an in-depth experimental study of the interplay between potentially suitable physical representations and seven dimensions of workload characteristics that vary across actual Datalog programs, revealing which properties actually matter. Based on these insights, we design an automatic selection mechanism that utilizes a set of decision trees to identify suitable physical representations for a given workload.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05651v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Groups and Inverse Semigroups in Lambda Calculus</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05654</link><description>arXiv:2602.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study invertibility of $\lambda$-terms modulo $\lambda$-theories. Here a fundamental role is played by a class of $\lambda$-terms called finite hereditary permutations (FHP) and by their infinite generalisations (HP). More precisely, FHPs are the invertible elements in the least extensional $\lambda$-theory $\lambda \eta$ and HPs are those in the greatest sensible $\lambda$-theory $H^*$. Our approach is based on inverse semigroups, algebraic structures that generalise groups and semilattices. We show that FHP modulo a $\lambda$-theory $T$ is always an inverse semigroup and that HP modulo $T$ is an inverse semigroup whenever $T$ contains the theory of B\"ohm trees. An inverse semigroup comes equipped with a natural order. We prove that the natural order corresponds to $\eta$-expansion in $\mathrm{FHP} /T$, and to infinite $\eta$-expansion in $\mathrm{HP}/T$. Building on these correspondences we obtain the two main contributions of this work: firstly, we recast in a broader framework the results cited at the beginning; secondly, we prove that the FHPs are the invertible $\lambda$-terms in all the $\lambda$-theories lying between $\lambda \eta$ and $H^+$. The latter is Morris' observational $\lambda$-theory, defined by using the $\beta$-normal forms as observables.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05654v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Alignment Verifiability in Large Language Models: Normative Indistinguishability under Behavioral Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05656</link><description>arXiv:2602.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.
  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.
  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.
  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05656v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tight Long-Term Tail Decay of (Clipped) SGD in Non-Convex Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05657</link><description>arXiv:2602.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{\beta_p}/\log(t)}$, where $\beta_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{\beta_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05657v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probabilistic Multi-Regional Solar Power Forecasting with Any-Quantile Recurrent Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05660</link><description>arXiv:2602.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation introduces significant uncertainty into power system operation, necessitating forecasting approaches that extend beyond deterministic point predictions. This paper proposes an any-quantile probabilistic forecasting framework for multi-regional PV power generation based on the Any-Quantile Recurrent Neural Network (AQ-RNN). The model integrates an any-quantile forecasting paradigm with a dual-track recurrent architecture that jointly processes series-specific and cross-regional contextual information, supported by dilated recurrent cells, patch-based temporal modeling, and a dynamic ensemble mechanism.
  The proposed framework enables the estimation of calibrated conditional quantiles at arbitrary probability levels within a single trained model and effectively exploits spatial dependencies to enhance robustness at the system level. The approach is evaluated using 30 years of hourly PV generation data from 259 European regions and compared against established statistical and neural probabilistic baselines. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in forecast accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality, underscoring the suitability of the proposed method for uncertainty-aware energy management and operational decision-making in renewable-dominated power systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05660v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Making AI Agents Evaluate Misleading Charts without Nudging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05662</link><description>arXiv:2602.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used as low-cost proxies for early visualization evaluation. In an initial study of deliberately flawed charts, we test whether agents spontaneously penalise chart junk and misleading encodings without being prompted to look for errors. Using established scales (BeauVis and PREVis), the agent evaluated visualizations containing decorative clutter, manipulated axes, and distorted proportional cues. The ratings of aesthetic appeal and perceived readability often remained relatively high even when graphical integrity was compromised. These results suggest that un-nudged AI agent evaluation may underweight integrity-related defects unless such checks are explicitly elicited.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05662v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GLASS: A Generative Recommender for Long-sequence Modeling via SID-Tier and Semantic Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05663</link><description>arXiv:2602.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging long-term user behavioral patterns is a key trajectory for enhancing the accuracy of modern recommender systems. While generative recommender systems have emerged as a transformative paradigm, they face hurdles in effectively modeling extensive historical sequences. To address this challenge, we propose GLASS, a novel framework that integrates long-term user interests into the generative process via SID-Tier and Semantic Search. We first introduce SID-Tier, a module that maps long-term interactions into a unified interest vector to enhance the prediction of the initial SID token. Unlike traditional retrieval models that struggle with massive item spaces, SID-Tier leverages the compact nature of the semantic codebook to incorporate cross features between the user's long-term history and candidate semantic codes. Furthermore, we present semantic hard search, which utilizes generated coarse-grained semantic ID as dynamic keys to extract relevant historical behaviors, which are then fused via an adaptive gated fusion module to recalibrate the trajectory of subsequent fine-grained tokens. To address the inherent data sparsity in semantic hard search, we propose two strategies: semantic neighbor augmentation and codebook resizing. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets, TAOBAO-MM and KuaiRec, demonstrate that GLASS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant gains in recommendation quality. Our codes are made publicly available to facilitate further research in generative recommendation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05663v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph-based Agent Memory: Taxonomy, Techniques, and Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05665</link><description>arXiv:2602.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory emerges as the core module in the Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents for long-horizon complex tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, game playing, scientific discovery), where memory can enable knowledge accumulation, iterative reasoning and self-evolution. Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient beam coverage design for multi-antenna systems in both far-field and near-field cases. To reduce the computational complexity of existing sampling-based optimization methods, we propose a new low-complexity yet efficient beam coverage design. To this end, we first formulate a general beam coverage optimization problem to maximize the worst-case beamforming gain over a target region. For the far-field case, we show that the beam coverage design can be viewed as a spatial-frequency filtering problem, where angular coverage can be achieved by weight-shaping in the antenna domain via an inverse FT, yielding an infinite-length weighting sequence. Under the constraint of a finite number of antennas, a surrogate scheme is proposed by directly truncating this sequence, which inevitably introduces a roll-off effect at the angular boundaries, yielding degraded worst-case beamforming gain. To address this issue, we characterize the finite-antenna-induced roll-off effect, based on which a roll-off-aware design with a protective zoom is developed to ensure a flat beamforming-gain profile within the target angular region. Next, we extend the proposed method to the near-field case. Specifically, by applying a first-order Taylor approximation to the near-field channel steering vector (CSV), the two-dimensional (2D) beam coverage design (in both angle and inverse-range) can be transformed into a 2D inverse FT, leading to a low-complexity beamforming design. Furthermore, an inherent near-field range defocusing effect is observed, indicating that sufficiently wide angular coverage results in range-insensitive beam steering. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FT-based approach achieves a comparable worst-case beamforming performance with that of conventional sampling-based optimization methods while significantly reducing the computational complexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05666v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating Benchmarking of Functional Connectivity Modeling via Structure-aware Core-set Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05667</link><description>arXiv:2602.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking the hundreds of functional connectivity (FC) modeling methods on large-scale fMRI datasets is critical for reproducible neuroscience. However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

Abstract: Modern science increasingly relies on ever-growing observational datasets and automated inference pipelines, under the implicit belief that accumulating more data makes scientific conclusions more reliable. Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity. We argue that inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability, but must instead be governed by explicit constraints on the integrity of the observational process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05668v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HyperPotter: Spell the Charm of High-Order Interactions in Audio Deepfake Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05670</link><description>arXiv:2602.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in AIGC technologies have enabled the synthesis of highly realistic audio deepfakes capable of deceiving human auditory perception. Although numerous audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been developed, most rely on local temporal/spectral features or pairwise relations, overlooking high-order interactions (HOIs). HOIs capture discriminative patterns that emerge from multiple feature components beyond their individual contributions. We propose HyperPotter, a hypergraph-based framework that explicitly models these synergistic HOIs through clustering-based hyperedges with class-aware prototype initialization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperPotter surpasses its baseline by an average relative gain of 22.15% across 11 datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 13.96% on 4 challenging cross-domain datasets, demonstrating superior generalization to diverse attacks and speakers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05670v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] (Computer) Vision in Action: Comparing Remote Sighted Assistance and a Multimodal Voice Agent in Inspection Sequences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05671</link><description>arXiv:2602.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does human-AI assistance unfold in the same way as human-human assistance? This research explores what can be learned from the expertise of blind individuals and sighted volunteers to inform the design of multimodal voice agents and address the enduring challenge of proactivity. Drawing on granular analysis of two representative fragments from a larger corpus, we contrast the practices co-produced by an experienced human remote sighted assistant and a blind participant-as they collaborate to find a stain on a blanket over the phone-with those achieved when the same participant worked with a multimodal voice agent on the same task, a few moments earlier. This comparison enables us to specify precisely which fundamental proactive practices the agent did not enact in situ. We conclude that, so long as multimodal voice agents cannot produce environmentally occasioned vision-based actions, they will lack a key resource relied upon by human remote sighted assistants.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05671v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Variable Search Stepsize for Randomized Local Search in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05675</link><description>arXiv:2602.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, research in evolutionary multi-objective optimization has predominantly focused on continuous domains, with comparatively limited attention given to multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs). Combinatorial problems differ significantly from continuous ones in terms of problem structure and landscape. Recent studies have shown that on MOCOPs multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can even be outperformed by simple randomised local search. Starting with a randomly sampled solution in search space, randomised local search iteratively draws a random solution (from an archive) to perform local variation within its neighbourhood. However, in most existing methods, the local variation relies on a fixed neighbourhood, which limits exploration and makes the search easy to get trapped in local optima. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective local search method, called variable stepsize randomized local search (VS-RLS), which adjusts the stepsize during the search. VS-RLS transitions gradually from a broad, exploratory search in the early phases to a more focused, fine-grained search as the search progresses. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of VS-RLS through extensive evaluations against local search and MOEAs methods on diverse MOCOPs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05675v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ShapeUP: Scalable Image-Conditioned 3D Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05676</link><description>arXiv:2602.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D foundation models have enabled the generation of high-fidelity assets, yet precise 3D manipulation remains a significant challenge. Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This image-as-prompt approach enables fine-grained visual control over both local and global edits and achieves implicit, mask-free localization, while maintaining strict structural consistency with the original asset. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ShapeUP consistently outperforms current trained and training-free baselines in both identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05676v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Perception-Based Beliefs for POMDPs with Visual Observations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05679</link><description>arXiv:2602.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a principled planning model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05679v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Stronger Benchmark for Online Bilateral Trade: From Fixed Prices to Distributions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05681</link><description>arXiv:2602.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online bilateral trade, where a learner facilitates repeated exchanges between a buyer and a seller to maximize the Gain From Trade (GFT), i.e., the social welfare. In doing so, the learner must guarantee not to subsidize the market. This constraint is usually imposed per round through Weak Budget Balance (WBB). Despite that, Bernasconi et al. [2024] show that a Global Budget Balance (GBB) constraint on the profit -- enforced over the entire time horizon -- can improve the GFT by a multiplicative factor of two. While this might appear to be a marginal relaxation, this implies that all existing WBB-focused algorithms suffer linear regret when measured against the GBB optimum. In this work, we provide the first algorithm to achieve sublinear regret against the GBB benchmark in stochastic environments under one-bit feedback. In particular, we show that when the joint distribution of valuations has a bounded density, our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret. Our result shows that there is no separation between the one-dimensional problem of learning the optimal WBB price and the two-dimensional problem of learning the optimal GBB distribution over pairs of prices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05681v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Vision to Decision: Neuromorphic Control for Autonomous Navigation and Tracking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05683</link><description>arXiv:2602.05683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic navigation has historically struggled to reconcile reactive, sensor-based control with the decisive capabilities of model-based planners. This duality becomes critical when the absence of a predominant option among goals leads to indecision, challenging reactive systems to break symmetries without computationally-intense planners. We propose a parsimonious neuromorphic control framework that bridges this gap for vision-guided navigation and tracking. Image pixels from an onboard camera are encoded as inputs to dynamic neuronal populations that directly transform visual target excitation into egocentric motion commands. A dynamic bifurcation mechanism resolves indecision by delaying commitment until a critical point induced by the environmental geometry. Inspired by recently proposed mechanistic models of animal cognition and opinion dynamics, the neuromorphic controller provides real-time autonomy with a minimal computational burden, a small number of interpretable parameters, and can be seamlessly integrated with application-specific image processing pipelines. We validate our approach in simulation environments as well as on an experimental quadrotor platform.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05683v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring AI-Augmented Sensemaking of Patient-Generated Health Data: A Mixed-Method Study with Healthcare Professionals in Cardiac Risk Reduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05687</link><description>arXiv:2602.05687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals are increasingly generating substantial personal health and lifestyle data, e.g. through wearables and smartphones. While such data could transform preventative care, its integration into clinical practice is hindered by its scale, heterogeneity and the time pressure and data literacy of healthcare professionals (HCPs). We explore how large language models (LLMs) can support sensemaking of patient-generated health data (PGHD) with automated summaries and natural language data exploration. Using cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction as a use case, 16 HCPs reviewed multimodal PGHD in a mixed-methods study with a prototype that integrated common charts, LLM-generated summaries, and a conversational interface. Findings show that AI summaries provided quick overviews that anchored exploration, while conversational interaction supported flexible analysis and bridged data-literacy gaps. However, HCPs raised concerns about transparency, privacy, and overreliance. We contribute empirical insights and sociotechnical design implications for integrating AI-driven summarization and conversation into clinical workflows to support PGHD sensemaking.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05687v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mining Generalizable Activation Functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05688</link><description>arXiv:2602.05688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of activation function is an active area of research, with different proposals aimed at improving optimization, while maintaining expressivity. Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05688v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Almost Asymptotically Optimal Active Clustering Through Pairwise Observations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05690</link><description>arXiv:2602.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new analysis framework for clustering $M$ items into an unknown number of $K$ distinct groups using noisy and actively collected responses. At each time step, an agent is allowed to query pairs of items and observe bandit binary feedback. If the pair of items belongs to the same (resp.\ different) cluster, the observed feedback is $1$ with probability $p&gt;1/2$ (resp.\ $q&lt;1/2$). Leveraging the ubiquitous change-of-measure technique, we establish a fundamental lower bound on the expected number of queries needed to achieve a desired confidence in the clustering accuracy, formulated as a sup-inf optimization problem. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design an asymptotically optimal algorithm in which the stopping criterion involves an empirical version of the inner infimum -- the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic -- being compared to a threshold. We develop a computationally feasible variant of the GLR statistic and show that its performance gap to the lower bound can be accurately empirically estimated and remains within a constant multiple of the lower bound.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05690v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MedErrBench: A Fine-Grained Multilingual Benchmark for Medical Error Detection and Correction with Clinical Expert Annotations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05692</link><description>arXiv:2602.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inaccuracies in existing or generated clinical text may lead to serious adverse consequences, especially if it is a misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment suggestion. With Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly being used across diverse healthcare applications, comprehensive evaluation through dedicated benchmarks is crucial. However, such datasets remain scarce, especially across diverse languages and contexts. In this paper, we introduce MedErrBench, the first multilingual benchmark for error detection, localization, and correction, developed under the guidance of experienced clinicians. Based on an expanded taxonomy of ten common error types, MedErrBench covers English, Arabic and Chinese, with natural clinical cases annotated and reviewed by domain experts. We assessed the performance of a range of general-purpose, language-specific, and medical-domain language models across all three tasks. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in non-English settings, highlighting the need for clinically grounded, language-aware systems. By making MedErrBench and our evaluation protocols publicly-available, we aim to advance multilingual clinical NLP to promote safer and more equitable AI-based healthcare globally. The dataset is available in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Consensus-Aligned Neuron Efficient Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Multi-Domain Machine Translation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05694</link><description>arXiv:2602.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-domain machine translation (MDMT) aims to build a unified model capable of translating content across diverse domains. Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains evidence that our method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05694v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Determining Energy Efficiency Sweet Spots in Production LLM Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05695</link><description>arXiv:2602.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05695v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SEAL: Symbolic Execution with Separation Logic (Competition Contribution)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05703</link><description>arXiv:2602.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SEAL is a static analyser for the verification of programs that manipulate unbounded linked data structures. It is based on separation logic to represent abstract memory states and, unlike other separation-logic-based approaches, it employs a general-purpose separation logic solver Astral for satisfiability and entailment checking, which itself is based on translation to SMT. This design results in a modular architecture intended to be easier to extend and to combine with reasoning in other theories. Although still a prototype, SEAL achieved competitive results in the LinkedLists base category and was one of only four analysers capable of verifying programs with unbounded lists. We believe that the tool's extensibility, combined with further development, can lead to significant improvements in future competitions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05703v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Limitations of SGD for Multi-Index Models Beyond Statistical Queries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05704</link><description>arXiv:2602.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the limitations of gradient methods, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in particular, is a central challenge in learning theory. To that end, a commonly used tool is the Statistical Queries (SQ) framework, which studies performance limits of algorithms based on noisy interaction with the data. However, it is known that the formal connection between the SQ framework and SGD is tenuous: Existing results typically rely on adversarial or specially-structured gradient noise that does not reflect the noise in standard SGD, and (as we point out here) can sometimes lead to incorrect predictions. Moreover, many analyses of SGD for challenging problems rely on non-trivial algorithmic modifications, such as restricting the SGD trajectory to the sphere or using very small learning rates. To address these shortcomings, we develop a new, non-SQ framework to study the limitations of standard vanilla SGD, for single-index and multi-index models (namely, when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the inputs). Our results apply to a broad class of settings and architectures, including (potentially deep) neural networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05704v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fix Representation (Optimally) Before Fairness: Finite-Sample Shrinkage Population Correction and the True Price of Fairness Under Subpopulation Shift</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05707</link><description>arXiv:2602.05707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning practitioners frequently observe tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness constraints -- yet sometimes fairness interventions appear to improve accuracy. We show that both phenomena can be artifacts of training data that misrepresents subgroup proportions. Under subpopulation shift (stable within-group distributions, shifted group proportions), we establish: (i) full importance-weighted correction is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal; (ii) the optimal finite-sample correction is a shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between target and training mixtures; (iii) apparent "fairness helps accuracy" can arise from comparing fairness methods to an improperly-weighted baseline. We provide an actionable evaluation protocol: fix representation (optimally) before fairness -- compare fairness interventions against a shrinkage-corrected baseline to isolate the true, irreducible price of fairness. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks (Adult, COMPAS) validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that this protocol eliminates spurious tradeoffs, revealing the genuine fairness-utility frontier.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05707v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cost-Efficient RAG for Entity Matching with LLMs: A Blocking-based Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05708</link><description>arXiv:2602.05708v1 Announce Type: new

We also present a unified framework for analyzing and evaluating RAG systems for entity matching, focusing on blocking-aware optimizations and retrieval granularity. Extensive experiments suggest that CE-RAG4EM can achieve comparable or improved matching quality while substantially reducing end-to-end runtime relative to strong baselines. Our analysis further reveals that key configuration parameters introduce an inherent trade-off between performance and overhead, offering practical guidance for designing efficient and scalable RAG systems for entity matching and data integration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05708v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Nonlinearity as Rank: Generative Low-Rank Adapter with Radial Basis Functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05709</link><description>arXiv:2602.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

Abstract: This study challenges the presumed neutrality of latent spaces in vision language models (VLMs) by adopting an ethological perspective on their algorithmic behaviors. Rather than constituting spaces of homogeneous indeterminacy, latent spaces exhibit model-specific algorithmic sensitivities, understood as differential regimes of perceptual salience shaped by training data and architectural choices.
  Through a comparative analysis of three models (OpenAI CLIP, OpenCLIP LAION, SigLIP) applied to a corpus of 301 artworks (15th to 20th), we reveal substantial divergences in the attribution of political and cultural categories. Using bipolar semantic axes derived from vector analogies (Mikolov et al., 2013), we show that SigLIP classifies 59.4% of the artworks as politically engaged, compared to only 4% for OpenCLIP. African masks receive the highest political scores in SigLIP while remaining apolitical in OpenAI CLIP. On an aesthetic colonial axis, inter-model discrepancies reach 72.6 percentage points.
  We introduce three operational concepts: computational latent politicization, describing the emergence of political categories without intentional encoding; emergent bias, irreducible to statistical or normative bias and detectable only through contrastive analysis; and three algorithmic scopic regimes: entropic (LAION), institutional (OpenAI), and semiotic (SigLIP), which structure distinct modes of visibility. Drawing on Foucault's notion of the archive, Jameson's ideologeme, and Simondon's theory of individuation, we argue that training datasets function as quasi-archives whose discursive formations crystallize within latent space. This work contributes to a critical reassessment of the conditions under which VLMs are applied to digital art history and calls for methodologies that integrate learning architectures into any delegation of cultural interpretation to algorithmic agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05710v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OmniMoE: An Efficient MoE by Orchestrating Atomic Experts at Scale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05711</link><description>arXiv:2602.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are evolving towards finer granularity to improve parameter efficiency. However, existing MoE designs face an inherent trade-off between the granularity of expert specialization and hardware execution efficiency. We propose OmniMoE, a system-algorithm co-designed framework that pushes expert granularity to its logical extreme. OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, enabling scalable routing and execution within a single MoE layer, while retaining a shared dense MLP branch for general-purpose processing. Although this atomic design maximizes capacity, it poses severe challenges for routing complexity and memory access. To address these, OmniMoE adopts a system-algorithm co-design: (i) a Cartesian Product Router that decomposes the massive index space to reduce routing complexity from O(N) to O(sqrt(N)); and (ii) Expert-Centric Scheduling that inverts the execution order to turn scattered, memory-bound lookups into efficient dense matrix operations. Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines. Crucially, OmniMoE reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms (a 10.9-fold speedup) compared to PEER, demonstrating that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be fast and accurate.

Abstract: Context: AI-assisted tools are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, but their reliance on large language models (LLMs) introduces substantial computational and energy costs. Understanding and reducing the energy footprint of LLM inference is therefore essential for sustainable software development. Objective: In this study, we conduct a phase-level analysis of LLM inference energy consumption, distinguishing between the (1) prefill, where the model processes the input and builds internal representations, and (2) decoding, where output tokens are generated using the stored state. Method: We investigate six 6B-7B and four 3B-4B transformer-based models, evaluating them on code-centric benchmarks HumanEval for code generation and LongBench for code understanding. Results: Our findings show that, within both parameter groups, models exhibit distinct energy patterns across phases. Furthermore, we observed that increases in prefill cost amplify the energy cost per token during decoding, with amplifications ranging from 1.3% to 51.8% depending on the model. Lastly, three out of ten models demonstrate babbling behavior, adding excessive content to the output that unnecessarily inflates energy consumption. We implemented babbling suppression for code generation, achieving energy savings ranging from 44% to 89% without affecting generation accuracy. Conclusion: These findings show that prefill costs influence decoding, which dominates energy consumption, and that babbling suppression can yield up to 89% energy savings. Reducing inference energy therefore requires both mitigating babbling behavior and limiting impact of prefill on decoding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05712v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Projected Boosting with Fairness Constraints: Quantifying the Cost of Fair Training Distributions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05713</link><description>arXiv:2602.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boosting algorithms enjoy strong theoretical guarantees: when weak learners maintain positive edge, AdaBoost achieves geometric decrease of exponential loss. We study how to incorporate group fairness constraints into boosting while preserving analyzable training dynamics. Our approach, FairBoost, projects the ensemble-induced exponential-weights distribution onto a convex set of distributions satisfying fairness constraints (as a reweighting surrogate), then trains weak learners on this fair distribution. The key theoretical insight is that projecting the training distribution reduces the effective edge of weak learners by a quantity controlled by the KL-divergence of the projection. We prove an exponential-loss bound where the convergence rate depends on weak learner edge minus a "fairness cost" term $\delta_t = \sqrt{\mathrm{KL}(w^t \| q^t)/2}$. This directly quantifies the accuracy-fairness tradeoff in boosting dynamics. Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the theoretical predictions and demonstrate competitive fairness-accuracy tradeoffs with stable training curves.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05713v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Anchored Policy Optimization: Mitigating Exploration Collapse Via Support-Constrained Rectification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05717</link><description>arXiv:2602.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05717v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Dual-Loop Agent Framework for Automated Vulnerability Reproduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05721</link><description>arXiv:2602.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated vulnerability reproduction from CVE descriptions requires generating executable Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits and validating them in target environments. This process is critical in software security research and practice, yet remains time-consuming and demands specialized expertise when performed manually. While LLM agents show promise for automating this task, existing approaches often conflate exploring attack directions with fixing implementation details, which leads to unproductive debugging loops when reproduction fails. To address this, we propose Cve2PoC, an LLM-based dual-loop agent framework following a plan-execute-evaluate paradigm. The Strategic Planner analyzes vulnerability semantics and target code to produce structured attack plans. The Tactical Executor generates PoC code and validates it through progressive verification. The Adaptive Refiner evaluates execution results and routes failures to different loops: the \textit{Tactical Loop} for code-level refinement, while the \textit{Strategic Loop} for attack strategy replanning. This dual-loop design enables the framework to escape ineffective debugging by matching remediation to failure type. Evaluation on two benchmarks covering 617 real-world vulnerabilities demonstrates that Cve2PoC achieves 82.9\% and 54.3\% reproduction success rates on SecBench.js and PatchEval, respectively, outperforming the best baseline by 11.3\% and 20.4\%. Human evaluation confirms that generated PoCs achieve comparable code quality to human-written exploits in readability and reusability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05721v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Hallucination in Financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Fine-Grained Knowledge Verification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05723</link><description>arXiv:2602.05723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05723v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Muon in Associative Memory Learning: Training Dynamics and Scaling Laws</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05725</link><description>arXiv:2602.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon updates matrix parameters via the matrix sign of the gradient and has shown strong empirical gains, yet its dynamics and scaling behavior remain unclear in theory. We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice. Experiments on synthetic long-tail classification and LLaMA-style pre-training corroborate the theory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05725v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CompactRAG: Reducing LLM Calls and Token Overhead in Multi-Hop Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05728</link><description>arXiv:2602.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for knowledge-intensive question answering. However, existing multi-hop RAG systems remain inefficient, as they alternate between retrieval and reasoning at each step, resulting in repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops. We propose CompactRAG, a simple yet effective framework that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.
  In the offline stage, an LLM reads the corpus once and converts it into an atomic QA knowledge base, which represents knowledge as minimal, fine-grained question-answer pairs. In the online stage, complex queries are decomposed and carefully rewritten to preserve entity consistency, and are resolved through dense retrieval followed by RoBERTa-based answer extraction. Notably, during inference, the LLM is invoked only twice in total - once for sub-question decomposition and once for final answer synthesis - regardless of the number of reasoning hops.
  Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines, highlighting a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora. The implementation is available at GitHub.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05728v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Global and Fine-Grained Perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings Compatible with Hard Negative Amplification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05729</link><description>arXiv:2602.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal embeddings serve as a bridge for aligning vision and language, with the two primary implementations -- CLIP-based and MLLM-based embedding models -- both limited to capturing only global semantic information. Although numerous studies have focused on fine-grained understanding, we observe that complex scenarios currently targeted by MLLM embeddings often involve a hybrid perceptual pattern of both global and fine-grained elements, thus necessitating a compatible fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method that prompts the MLLM to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. Furthermore, we adapt AGFF-Embed with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique to achieve in-batch hard negatives enhancement without requiring fine-grained editing of the dataset. Evaluation on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks shows that AGFF-Embed comprehensively achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding compared to other multimodal embedding models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05729v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Depth as Prior Knowledge for Object Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05730</link><description>arXiv:2602.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting small and distant objects remains challenging for object detectors due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects for safe planning. Depth information can improve detection, but existing approaches require complex, model-specific architectural modifications. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by an empirical investigation of the depth-detection relationship. Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections). DepthPrior offers these benefits without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs.

Abstract: Search behaviour is characterised using synonymy and polysemy as users often want to search information based on meaning. Semantic representation strategies represent a move towards richer associative connections that can adequately capture this complex usage of language. Vector Space Modelling (VSM) and neural word embeddings play a crucial role in modern machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines. Embeddings use distributional semantics to represent words, sentences, paragraphs or entire documents as vectors in high dimensional spaces. This can be leveraged by Information Retrieval (IR) systems to exploit the semantic relatedness between queries and answers.
  This paper evaluates an alternative approach to measuring query statement similarity that moves away from the common similarity measure of centroids of neural word embeddings. Motivated by the Word Movers Distance (WMD) model, similarity is evaluated using the distance between individual words of queries and statements. Results from ranked query and response statements demonstrate significant gains in accuracy using the combined approach of similarity ranking through WMD with the word embedding techniques. The top performing WMD + GloVe combination outperforms all other state-of-the-art retrieval models including Doc2Vec and the baseline LSA model. Along with the significant gains in performance of similarity ranking through WMD, we conclude that the use of pre-trained word embeddings, trained on vast amounts of data, result in domain agnostic language processing solutions that are portable to diverse business use-cases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05734v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CSRv2: Unlocking Ultra-Sparse Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05735</link><description>arXiv:2602.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neuro-Inspired Visual Pattern Recognition via Biological Reservoir Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05737</link><description>arXiv:2602.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a neuro-inspired approach to reservoir computing (RC) in which a network of in vitro cultured cortical neurons serves as the physical reservoir. Rather than relying on artificial recurrent models to approximate neural dynamics, our biological reservoir computing (BRC) system leverages the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity of living neural circuits as its computational substrate. A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) provides simultaneous stimulation and readout across hundreds of channels: input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting high-dimensional neural responses, yielding a biologically grounded feature representation. A linear readout layer (single-layer perceptron) is then trained to classify these reservoir states, enabling the living neural network to perform static visual pattern-recognition tasks within a computer-vision framework. We evaluate the system across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from pointwise stimuli to oriented bars, clock-digit-like shapes, and handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Despite the inherent variability of biological neural responses-arising from noise, spontaneous activity, and inter-session differences-the system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification. These results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks. More broadly, this work contributes to the effort to incorporate biological principles into machine learning and supports the goals of neuro-inspired vision by illustrating how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically grounded computational models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05737v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Bayesian Optimization-Based AutoML Framework for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05739</link><description>arXiv:2602.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), commonly known as energy disaggregation, aims to estimate the power consumption of individual appliances by analyzing a home's total electricity usage.

Abstract: FP8 low-precision formats have gained significant adoption in Transformer inference and training. However, existing digital compute-in-memory (DCIM) architectures face challenges in supporting variable FP8 aligned-mantissa bitwidths, as unified alignment strategies and fixed-precision multiply-accumulate (MAC) units struggle to handle input data with diverse distributions. This work presents a flexible FP8 DCIM accelerator with three innovations: (1) a dynamic shift-aware bitwidth prediction (DSBP) with on-the-fly input prediction that adaptively adjusts weight (2/4/6/8b) and input (2$\sim$12b) aligned-mantissa precision; (2) a FIFO-based input alignment unit (FIAU) replacing complex barrel shifters with pointer-based control; and (3) a precision-scalable INT MAC array achieving flexible weight precision with minimal overhead. Implemented in 28nm CMOS with a 64$\times$96 CIM array, the design achieves 20.4 TFLOPS/W for fixed E5M7, demonstrating 2.8$\times$ higher FP8 efficiency than previous work while supporting all FP8 formats. Results on Llama-7b show that the DSBP achieves higher efficiency than fixed bitwidth mode at the same accuracy level on both BoolQ and Winogrande datasets, with configurable parameters enabling flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05743v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalized Pinsker Inequality for Bregman Divergences of Negative Tsallis Entropies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05744</link><description>arXiv:2602.05744v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a sample was part of a model's training set, posing serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems. Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05748v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How to Achieve the Intended Aim of Deep Clustering Now, without Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05749</link><description>arXiv:2602.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep clustering (DC) is often quoted to have a key advantage over $k$-means clustering. Yet, this advantage is often demonstrated using image datasets only, and it is unclear whether it addresses the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution. We uncover that a non-deep learning approach achieves the intended aim of deep clustering by making use of distributional information of clusters in a dataset to effectively address these fundamental limitations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TimelyFreeze: Adaptive Parameter Freezing Mechanism for Pipeline Parallelism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05754</link><description>arXiv:2602.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pipeline parallelism enables training models that exceed single-device memory, but practical throughput remains limited by pipeline bubbles. Although parameter freezing can improve training throughput by adaptively skipping backward computation, existing methods often over-freeze parameters, resulting in unnecessary accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we propose TimelyFreeze, which models the pipeline schedule as a directed acyclic graph and solves a linear program to compute optimal freeze ratios that minimize batch execution time under accuracy constraints. Experiments show that TimelyFreeze achieves up to 40% training throughput improvement on LLaMA-8B with comparable accuracy. Overall, it enables faster large-scale model training without compromising convergence and generalizes across diverse pipeline-parallel settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05754v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FMPose3D: monocular 3D pose estimation via flow matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05755</link><description>arXiv:2602.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is fundamentally ill-posed due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, thereby motivating probabilistic methods that generate multiple plausible 3D pose hypotheses. In particular, diffusion-based models have recently demonstrated strong performance, but their iterative denoising process typically requires many timesteps for each prediction, making inference computationally expensive. In contrast, we leverage Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), enabling efficient generation of 3D pose samples with only a few integration steps. We propose a novel generative pose estimation framework, FMPose3D, that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem. It continuously transports samples from a standard Gaussian prior to the distribution of plausible 3D poses conditioned only on 2D inputs. Although ODE trajectories are deterministic, FMPose3D naturally generates various pose hypotheses by sampling different noise seeds. To obtain a single accurate prediction from those hypotheses, we further introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module, which approximates the Bayesian posterior expectation over 3D hypotheses. FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on the widely used human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and further achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, demonstrating strong performance across both 3D pose domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a key driver for LLM reasoning. This capability is equally pivotal in long-context scenarios--such as long-dialogue understanding and structured data analysis, where the challenge extends beyond consuming tokens to performing rigorous deduction. While existing efforts focus on data synthesis or architectural changes, recent work points out that relying solely on sparse, outcome-only rewards yields limited gains, as such coarse signals are often insufficient to effectively guide the complex long-context reasoning. To address this, we propose LongR, a unified framework that enhances long-context performance by integrating a dynamic "Think-and-Read" mechanism, which interleaves reasoning with document consultation, with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of the relevant documents. Empirically, LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts. Furthermore, LongR consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms (e.g., DAPO, GSPO). Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to investigate the impact of reasoning chain length on efficiency and the model's robustness against distractors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05758v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Toward Quantum-Safe Software Engineering: A Vision for Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05759</link><description>arXiv:2602.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum threat to cybersecurity has accelerated the standardization of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Migrating legacy software to these quantum-safe algorithms is not a simple library swap, but a new software engineering challenge: existing vulnerability detection, refactoring, and testing tools are not designed for PQC's probabilistic behavior, side-channel sensitivity, and complex performance trade-offs. To address these challenges, this paper outlines a vision for a new class of tools and introduces the Automated Quantum-safe Adaptation (AQuA) framework, with a three-pillar agenda for PQC-aware detection, semantic refactoring, and hybrid verification, thereby motivating Quantum-Safe Software Engineering (QSSE) as a distinct research direction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05759v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Task-Oriented Robot-Human Handovers on Legged Manipulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05760</link><description>arXiv:2602.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented handovers (TOH) are fundamental to effective human-robot collaboration, requiring robots to present objects in a way that supports the human's intended post-handover use. Existing approaches are typically based on object- or task-specific affordances, but their ability to generalize to novel scenarios is limited. To address this gap, we present AFT-Handover, a framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven affordance reasoning with efficient texture-based affordance transfer to achieve zero-shot, generalizable TOH. Given a novel object-task pair, the method retrieves a proxy exemplar from a database, establishes part-level correspondences via LLM reasoning, and texturizes affordances for feature-based point cloud transfer. We evaluate AFT-Handover across diverse task-object pairs, showing improved handover success rates and stronger generalization compared to baselines. In a comparative user study, our framework is significantly preferred over the current state-of-the-art, effectively reducing human regrasping before tool use. Finally, we demonstrate TOH on legged manipulators, highlighting the potential of our framework for real-world robot-human handovers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05760v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RocqSmith: Can Automatic Optimization Forge Better Proof Agents?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05762</link><description>arXiv:2602.05762v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05765v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Different Time, Different Language: Revisiting the Bias Against Non-Native Speakers in GPT Detectors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05769</link><description>arXiv:2602.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based assistants have been widely popularised after the release of ChatGPT. Concerns have been raised about their misuse in academia, given the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and generated text. To combat this, automated techniques have been developed and shown to be effective, to some extent. However, prior work suggests that these methods often falsely flag essays from non-native speakers as generated, due to their low perplexity extracted from an LLM, which is supposedly a key feature of the detectors. We revisit these statements two years later, specifically in the Czech language setting. We show that the perplexity of texts from non-native speakers of Czech is not lower than that of native speakers. We further examine detectors from three separate families and find no systematic bias against non-native speakers. Finally, we demonstrate that contemporary detectors operate effectively without relying on perplexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05769v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Structural Equivalence of Symmetric TSP to a Constrained Group Steiner Tree Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05773</link><description>arXiv:2602.05773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a brief structural equivalence between the symmetric TSP and a constrained Group Steiner Tree Problem (cGSTP) defined on a simplicial incidence graph.

Selecting an admissible, disk-like set of triangles induces a unique boundary cycle.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates inference for (M)LLMs, yet a training-decoding discrepancy persists: while existing methods optimize single greedy trajectories, decoding involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths. We propose Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD), formulating draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR). Theoretical analysis confirms that VSD increases expected acceptance length and speedup. Extensive experiments across LLMs and MLLMs show that VSD achieves up to a 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05774v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-Domain Offline Policy Adaptation via Selective Transition Correction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05776</link><description>arXiv:2602.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains a critical challenge to adapt policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions. Consequently, we propose the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm, which enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation. Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05776v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Controlling the Variance can Improve Training Stability of Sparsely Activated DNNs and CNNs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05779</link><description>arXiv:2602.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intermediate layers of deep networks can be characterised as a Gaussian process, in particular the Edge-of-Chaos (EoC) initialisation strategy prescribes the limiting covariance matrix of the Gaussian process. Here we show that the under-utilised chosen variance of the Gaussian process is important in the training of deep networks with sparsity inducing activation, such as a shifted and clipped ReLU, $\text{CReLU}_{\tau,m}(x)=\min(\max(x-\tau,0),m)$. Specifically, initialisations leading to larger fixed Gaussian process variances, allow for improved expressivity with activation sparsity as large as 90% in DNNs and CNNs, and generally improve the stability of the training process. Enabling full, or near full, accuracy at such high levels of sparsity in the hidden layers suggests a promising mechanism to reduce the energy consumption of machine learning models involving fully connected layers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05779v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated Customization of LLMs for Enterprise Code Repositories Using Semantic Scopes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05780</link><description>arXiv:2602.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code completion (CC) is a task frequently used by developers when working in collaboration with LLM-based programming assistants. Despite the increased performance of LLMs on public benchmarks, out of the box LLMs still have a hard time generating code that aligns with a private code repository not previously seen by the model's training data. Customizing code LLMs to a private repository provides a way to improve the model performance. In this paper we present our approach for automated LLM customization based on semantic scopes in the code. We evaluate LLMs on real industry cases with two private enterprise code repositories with two customization strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and supervised Fine-Tuning (FT). Our mechanism for ingesting the repository's data and formulating the training data pairs with semantic scopes helps models to learn the underlying patterns specific to the repository, providing more precise code to developers and helping to boost their productivity. The code completions of moderately sized customized models can be significantly better than those of uncustomized models of much larger capacity. We also include an analysis of customization on two public benchmarks and present opportunities for future work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05780v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReText: Text Boosts Generalization in Image-Based Person Re-identification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05785</link><description>arXiv:2602.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizable image-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across cameras in unseen domains without retraining. While multiple existing approaches address the domain gap through complex architectures, recent findings indicate that better generalization can be achieved by stylistically diverse single-camera data. Although this data is easy to collect, it lacks complexity due to minimal cross-view variation. We propose ReText, a novel method trained on a mixture of multi-camera Re-ID data and single-camera data, where the latter is complemented by textual descriptions to enrich semantic cues. During training, ReText jointly optimizes three tasks: (1) Re-ID on multi-camera data, (2) image-text matching, and (3) image reconstruction guided by text on single-camera data. Experiments demonstrate that ReText achieves strong generalization and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore multimodal joint learning on a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data in image-based person Re-ID.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05785v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Selecting Hyperparameters for Tree-Boosting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05786</link><description>arXiv:2602.05786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree-boosting is a widely used machine learning technique for tabular data. However, its out-of-sample accuracy is critically dependent on multiple hyperparameters. In this article, we empirically compare several popular methods for hyperparameter optimization for tree-boosting including random grid search, the tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE), Gaussian-process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), Hyperband, the sequential model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC) method, and deterministic full grid search using $59$ regression and classification data sets. We find that the SMAC method clearly outperforms all the other considered methods. We further observe that (i) a relatively large number of trials larger than $100$ is required for accurate tuning, (ii) using default values for hyperparameters yields very inaccurate models, (iii) all considered hyperparameters can have a material effect on the accuracy of tree-boosting, i.e., there is no small set of hyperparameters that is more important than others, and (iv) choosing the number of boosting iterations using early stopping yields more accurate results compared to including it in the search space for regression tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05786v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bagging-Based Model Merging for Robust General Text Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05787</link><description>arXiv:2602.05787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose text embedding models underpin a wide range of NLP and information retrieval applications, and are typically trained on large-scale multi-task corpora to encourage broad generalization. However, it remains unclear how different multi-task training strategies compare in practice, and how to efficiently adapt embedding models as new domains and data types continually emerge. In this work, we present a systematic study of multi-task training for text embeddings from two perspectives: data scheduling and model merging. We compare batch-level shuffling, sequential training variants, two-stage training, and multiple merging granularities, and find that simple batch-level shuffling consistently yields the strongest overall performance, suggesting that task conflicts are limited and training datasets are largely complementary. Despite its effectiveness, batch-level shuffling exhibits two practical limitations: suboptimal out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and poor suitability for incremental learning due to expensive full retraining. To address these issues, we propose Bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging (\modelname), which trains multiple embedding models on sampled subsets and merges them into a single model, improving robustness while retaining single-model inference efficiency. Moreover, \modelname naturally supports efficient incremental updates by training lightweight update models on new data with a small historical subset and merging them into the existing model. Experiments across diverse embedding benchmarks demonstrate that \modelname consistently improves both in-domain and OOD performance over full-corpus batch-level shuffling, while substantially reducing training cost in incremental learning settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05787v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Allocentric Perceiver: Disentangling Allocentric Reasoning from Egocentric Visual Priors via Frame Instantiation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05789</link><description>arXiv:2602.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rising need for spatially grounded tasks such as Vision-Language Navigation/Action, allocentric perception capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are receiving growing focus. However, VLMs remain brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, where the answer depends on reasoning in a target-centric frame rather than the observed camera view. Thus, we introduce Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that recovers metric 3D states from one or more images with off-the-shelf geometric experts, and then instantiates a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame aligned with the instruction's semantic intent. By deterministically transforming reconstructed geometry into the target frame and prompting the backbone VLM with structured, geometry-grounded representations, Allocentric Perceriver offloads mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation. We evaluate Allocentric Perciver across multiple backbone families on spatial reasoning benchmarks, observing consistent and substantial gains ($\sim$10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, and surpassing both spatial-perception-finetuned models and state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05789v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Price of universality in vector quantization is at most 0.11 bit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05790</link><description>arXiv:2602.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast computation of a matrix product $W^\top X$ is a workhorse of modern LLMs. To make their deployment more efficient, a popular approach is that of using a low-precision approximation $\widehat W$ in place of true $W$ ("weight-only quantization''). Information theory demonstrates that an optimal algorithm for reducing precision of $W$ depends on the (second order) statistics of $X$ and requires a careful alignment of vector quantization codebook with PCA directions of $X$ (a process known as "waterfilling allocation''). Dependence of the codebook on statistics of $X$, however, is highly impractical. This paper proves that there exist a universal codebook that is simultaneously near-optimal for all possible statistics of $X$, in the sense of being at least as good as an $X$-adapted waterfilling codebook with rate reduced by 0.11 bit per dimension. Such universal codebook would be an ideal candidate for the low-precision storage format, a topic of active modern research, but alas the existence proof is non-constructive.
  Equivalently, our result shows existence of a net in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is a nearly-optimal covering of a sphere simultaneously with respect to all Hilbert norms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05790v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable and General Whole-Body Control for Cross-Humanoid Locomotion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05791</link><description>arXiv:2602.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based whole-body controllers have become a key driver for humanoid robots, yet most existing approaches require robot-specific training. In this paper, we study the problem of cross-embodiment humanoid control and show that a single policy can robustly generalize across a wide range of humanoid robot designs with one-time training. We introduce XHugWBC, a novel cross-embodiment training framework that enables generalist humanoid control through: (1) physics-consistent morphological randomization, (2) semantically aligned observation and action spaces across diverse humanoid robots, and (3) effective policy architectures modeling morphological and dynamical properties. XHugWBC is not tied to any specific robot. Instead, it internalizes a broad distribution of morphological and dynamical characteristics during training. By learning motion priors from diverse randomized embodiments, the policy acquires a strong structural bias that supports zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robots. Experiments on twelve simulated humanoids and seven real-world robots demonstrate the strong generalization and robustness of the resulting universal controller.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05791v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data analysis of cloud virtualization experiments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05792</link><description>arXiv:2602.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cloud computing paradigm underlines data center and telecommunication infrastructure design. Heavily leveraging virtualization, it slices hardware and software resources into smaller software units for greater flexibility of manipulation. Given the considerable benefits, several virtualization forms, with varying processing and communication overheads, emerged, including Full Virtualization and OS Virtualization. As a result, predicting packet throughput at the data plane turns out to be more challenging due to the additional virtualization overhead located at CPU, I/O, and network resources. This research presents a dataset of active network measurements data collected while varying various network parameters, including CPU affinity, frequency of echo packet injection, type of virtual network driver, use of CPU, I/O, or network load, and the number of concurrent VMs. The virtualization technologies used in the study include KVM, LXC, and Docker. The work examines their impact on a key network metric, namely, end-to-end latency. Also, it builds data models to evaluate the impact of a cloud computing environment on packet round-trip time. To explore data visualization, the dataset was submitted to pre-processing, correlation analysis, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. In addition, this paper provides a brief analysis of the dataset, demonstrating its use in developing machine learning-based systems for administrator decision-making.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05792v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FiMI: A Domain-Specific Language Model for Indian Finance Ecosystem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05794</link><description>arXiv:2602.05794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FiMI (Finance Model for India), a domain-specialized financial language model developed for Indian digital payment systems.

FiMI adapts the Mistral Small 24B architecture through a multi-stage training pipeline, beginning with continuous pre-training on 68 Billion tokens of curated financial, multilingual (English, Hindi, Hinglish), and synthetic data.

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) has become a central topic in data privacy research, offering strong privacy guarantees by perturbing user data at the source and removing the need for a trusted curator. However, the noise introduced by LDP often significantly reduces data utility. To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility. We provide theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrate how our methods reduce this risk. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets show substantial improvements in classification accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05797v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Perturbation-Correction Method Based on Local Randomized Neural Networks for Quasi-Linear Interface Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05800</link><description>arXiv:2602.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quasi-linear interface problems with discontinuous diffusion coefficients, the nonconvex objective functional often leads to optimization stagnation in randomized neural network approximations. This paper Proposes a perturbation-correction framework based on Loacal Randomized Neural Networks(LRaNNs) to overcome this limitation. In the initialization step, a satisisfactory based approximation is obtained by minimizing the original nonconvex residual, typically stagnating at a moderate accuracy level. Subsequently, in the correction step, a correction term is determined by solving a subproblem governed by a perturbation expansion around the base approximation. This reformulation yields a convex optimization problem for the output coefficients, which guarantees rapic convergence. We rigorously derive an a posteriori error estitmate, demonstrating that the total generalization error is governed by the discrete residual norm, quadrature error, and a controllable truncation error. Numerical experiments on nonlinear diffusion problems with irregular moving interfaces, gradient-dependent diffusivities, and high-contrast media demonstrate that the proposed method effectively overcomes the optimization plateau. The correction step yields a significant improvement of 4-6 order of magnitude in L^2 accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05800v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privacy-Preserving Dynamic Average Consensus by Masking Reference Signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05803</link><description>arXiv:2602.05803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-agent systems, dynamic average consensus (DAC) is a decentralized estimation strategy in which a set of agents tracks the average of time-varying reference signals. Because DAC requires exchanging state information with neighbors, attackers may gain access to these states and infer private information. In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving method that protects each agent's reference signal from external eavesdroppers and honest-but-curious agents while achieving the same convergence accuracy and convergence rate as conventional DAC. Our approach masks the reference signals by having each agent draw a random real number for each neighbor, exchanges that number over an encrypted channel at the initialization, and computes a masking value to form a masked reference. Then the agents run the conventional DAC algorithm using the masked references. Convergence and privacy analyses show that the proposed algorithm matches the convergence properties of conventional DAC while preserving the privacy of the reference signals. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving DAC algorithm.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05803v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NEX: Neuron Explore-Exploit Scoring for Label-Free Chain-of-Thought Selection and Model Ranking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05805</link><description>arXiv:2602.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models increasingly spend inference compute sampling multiple chain-of-thought traces or searching over merged checkpoints. This shifts the bottleneck from generation to selection, often without supervision on the target distribution. We show entropy-based exploration proxies follow an inverted-U with accuracy, suggesting extra exploration can become redundant and induce overthinking. We propose NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework that views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation). NEX detects E-phase as spikes in newly activated MLP neurons per token from sparse activation caches, then uses a sticky two-state HMM to infer E-X phases and credits E-introduced neurons by whether they are reused in the following X span. These signals yield interpretable neuron weights and a single Good-Mass Fraction score to rank candidate responses and merged variants without task answers. Across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, NEX computed on a small unlabeled activation set predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants; we further validate the E-X signal with human annotations and provide causal evidence via "Effective-vs-Redundant" neuron transfer.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05805v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Focus-Scan-Refine: From Human Visual Perception to Efficient Visual Token Pruning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05809</link><description>arXiv:2602.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often generate massive visual tokens that greatly increase inference latency and memory footprint; while training-free token pruning offers a practical remedy, existing methods still struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression. We propose Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, then scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context by aggregating relevant details. FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens that are most different from the focused evidence. Finally, FSR refines the scanned context by aggregating nearby informative tokens into the scan anchors via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging, without increasing the token budget. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show that FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Abstract: Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05810v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] STProtein: predicting spatial protein expression from multi-omics data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05811</link><description>arXiv:2602.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of spatial multi-omics data from single tissues is crucial for advancing biological research. However, a significant data imbalance impedes progress: while spatial transcriptomics data is relatively abundant, spatial proteomics data remains scarce due to technical limitations and high costs. To overcome this challenge we propose STProtein, a novel framework leveraging graph neural networks with multi-task learning strategy. STProtein is designed to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression using more accessible spatial multi-omics data, such as spatial transcriptomics. We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences. This tool enables scientists to accelerate discovery by identifying complex and previously hidden spatial patterns of proteins within tissues, uncovering novel relationships between different marker genes, and exploring the biological "Dark Matter".</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05811v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Principled Confidence Estimation for Deep Computed Tomography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05812</link><description>arXiv:2602.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a principled framework for confidence estimation in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Based on the sequential likelihood mixing framework (Kirschner et al., 2025), we establish confidence regions with theoretical coverage guarantees for deep-learning-based CT reconstructions. We consider a realistic forward model following the Beer-Lambert law, i.e., a log-linear forward model with Poisson noise, closely reflecting clinical and scientific imaging conditions. The framework is general and applies to both classical algorithms and deep learning reconstruction methods, including U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions, without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees. Our approach allows the detection of hallucinations in reconstructed images and provides interpretable visualizations of confidence regions. This establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators, but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05812v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Where Does Warm-Up Come From?

Abstract: We study adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers (e.g., Muon and Lion). We introduce a generalized smoothness assumption under which local curvature decreases with the suboptimality gap and empirically verify that this behavior holds along optimization trajectories. Under this assumption, we establish convergence guarantees under an appropriate choice of learning rate, for which warm-up followed by decay arises naturally from the proof rather than being imposed heuristically.
  Building on this theory, we develop a practical learning rate scheduler that relies only on standard hyperparameters and adapts the warm-up duration automatically at the beginning of training. We evaluate this method on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures and show that our adaptive warm-up selection consistently outperforms or at least matches the best manually tuned warm-up schedules across all considered setups, without additional hyperparameter search.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has led to increasingly complex and heterogeneous network topologies. Traditional network monitoring and visualization tools rely on aggregated metrics or static representations, which fail to capture the evolving relationships and structural dependencies between devices. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to learn from relational data, their internal representations often remain opaque and difficult to interpret for security-critical operations. Consequently, this work introduces an interpretable pipeline that generates directly visualizable low-dimensional representations by mapping high-dimensional embeddings onto a latent manifold. This projection enables the interpretable monitoring and interoperability of evolving network states, while integrated feature attribution techniques decode the specific characteristics shaping the manifold structure. The framework achieves a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection while also highlighting phenomena such as concept drift. Ultimately, the presented approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional GNN embeddings and human-understandable network behavior, offering new insights for network administrators and security analysts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05817v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TKG-Thinker: Towards Dynamic Reasoning over Temporal Knowledge Graphs via Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05818</link><description>arXiv:2602.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05818v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Authorship Drift: How Self-Efficacy and Trust Evolve During LLM-Assisted Writing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05819</link><description>arXiv:2602.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as collaborative partners in writing. However, this raises a critical challenge of authorship, as users and models jointly shape text across interaction turns. Understanding authorship in this context requires examining users' evolving internal states during collaboration, particularly self-efficacy and trust. Yet, the dynamics of these states and their associations with users' prompting strategies and authorship outcomes remain underexplored. We examined these dynamics through a study of 302 participants in LLM-assisted writing, capturing interaction logs and turn-by-turn self-efficacy and trust ratings. Our analysis showed that collaboration generally decreased users' self-efficacy while increasing trust. Participants who lost self-efficacy were more likely to ask the LLM to edit their work directly, whereas those who recovered self-efficacy requested more review and feedback. Furthermore, participants with stable self-efficacy showed higher actual and perceived authorship of the final text. Based on these findings, we propose design implications for understanding and supporting authorship in human-LLM collaboration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05819v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NVS-HO: A Benchmark for Novel View Synthesis of Handheld Objects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05822</link><description>arXiv:2602.05822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose NVS-HO, the first benchmark designed for novel view synthesis of handheld objects in real-world environments using only RGB inputs. Each object is recorded in two complementary RGB sequences: (1) a handheld sequence, where the object is manipulated in front of a static camera, and (2) a board sequence, where the object is fixed on a ChArUco board to provide accurate camera poses via marker detection. The goal of NVS-HO is to learn a NVS model that captures the full appearance of an object from (1), whereas (2) provides the ground-truth images used for evaluation. To establish baselines, we consider both a classical SfM pipeline and a state-of-the-art pre-trained feed-forward neural network (VGGT) as pose estimators, and train NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments reveal significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions, highlighting the need for more robust approaches. NVS-HO thus offers a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ToMigo: Interpretable Design Concept Graphs for Aligning Generative AI with Creative Intent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05825</link><description>arXiv:2602.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI often produces results misaligned with user intentions, for example, resolving ambiguous prompts in unexpected ways. Despite existing approaches to clarify intent, a major challenge remains: understanding and influencing AI's interpretation of user intent through simple, direct inputs requiring no expertise or rigid procedures. We present ToMigo, representing intent as design concept graphs: nodes represent choices of purpose, content, or style, while edges link them with interpretable explanations. Applied to graphic design, ToMigo infers intent from reference images and text. We derived a schema of node types and edges from pre-study data, informing a multimodal large language model to generate graphs aligning nodes externally with user intent and internally toward a unified design goal. This structure enables users to explore AI reasoning and directly manipulate the design concept. In our user studies, ToMigo received high alignment ratings and captured most user intentions well. Users reported greater control and found interactive features-editable graphs, reflective chats, concept-design realignment-useful for evolving and realizing their design ideas.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05825v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Whispers of the Butterfly: A Research-through-Design Exploration of In-Situ Conversational AI Guidance in Large-Scale Outdoor MR Exhibitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05826</link><description>arXiv:2602.05826v1 Announce Type: new

We deployed Dream-Butterfly in a large-scale outdoor MR exhibition at a public university campus in southern China, and conducted an in-the-wild between-subject study (N=24) comparing a primarily human-led tour with an AI-led tour while keeping staff for safety in both conditions. Combining questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, we characterize how shifting the primary explanation channel reshapes explanation access, perceived responsiveness, immersion, and workload, and how visitors negotiate responsibility handoffs among staff, the AI guide, and themselves. We distill transferable design implications for configuring mixed human-AI guiding roles and embodying conversational agents in mobile, safety-constrained outdoor MR exhibitions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05826v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparse Video Generation Propels Real-World Beyond-the-View Vision-Language Navigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05827</link><description>arXiv:2602.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Weaver: End-to-End Agentic System Training for Video Interleaved Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05829</link><description>arXiv:2602.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video reasoning constitutes a comprehensive assessment of a model's capabilities, as it demands robust perceptual and interpretive skills, thereby serving as a means to explore the boundaries of model performance. While recent research has leveraged text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning to augment these capabilities, such approaches frequently suffer from representational mismatch and restricted by limited perceptual acuity. To address these limitations, we propose Weaver, a novel, end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system. Weaver empowers its policy model to dynamically invoke diverse tools throughout the reasoning process, enabling progressive acquisition of crucial visual cues and construction of authentic multimodal reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, we integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to allow the system to freely explore strategies for employing and combining these tools with trajectory-free data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Weaver, enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05829v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Compact Boolean Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05830</link><description>arXiv:2602.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floating-point neural networks dominate modern machine learning but incur substantial inference cost, motivating interest in Boolean networks for resource-constrained settings. However, learning compact and accurate Boolean networks is challenging due to their combinatorial nature. In this work, we address this challenge from three different angles: learned connections, compact convolutions and adaptive discretization. First, we propose a novel strategy to learn efficient connections with no additional parameters and negligible computational overhead. Second, we introduce a novel convolutional Boolean architecture that exploits the locality with reduced number of Boolean operations than existing methods. Third, we propose an adaptive discretization strategy to reduce the accuracy drop when converting a continuous-valued network into a Boolean one. Extensive results on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that the Pareto front of accuracy vs. computation of our method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art, achieving better accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05830v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UI-Mem: Self-Evolving Experience Memory for Online Reinforcement Learning in Mobile GUI Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05832</link><description>arXiv:2602.05832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising paradigm for enhancing GUI agents through direct environment interaction. However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

Abstract: There is a need for synthetic training and test datasets that replicate statistical distributions of original datasets without compromising their confidentiality. A lot of research has been done in leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. However, the resulting models are either not accurate enough or are still vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) or dataset reconstruction attacks since the original data has been leveraged in the training process. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of producing a synthetic test dataset with the same statistical properties as the original one, with only indirectly leveraging the original data in the generation process. The approach is inspired by GANs, with a generation step and a discrimination step. However, in our approach, we use a test generator (a fuzzer) to produce test data from an input specification, preserving constraints set by the original data; a discriminator model determines how close we are to the original data. By evolving samples and determining "good samples" with the discriminator, we can generate privacy-preserving data that follows the same statistical distributions are the original dataset, leading to a similar utility as the original data. We evaluated our approach on four datasets that have been used to evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach towards generating synthetic datasets that have high utility while preserving privacy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05833v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bandit Social Learning with Exploration Episodes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05835</link><description>arXiv:2602.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stylized social learning dynamics where self-interested agents collectively follow a simple multi-armed bandit protocol. Each agent controls an ``episode": a short sequence of consecutive decisions. Motivating applications include users repeatedly interacting with an AI, or repeatedly shopping at a marketplace. While agents are incentivized to explore within their respective episodes, we show that the aggregate exploration fails: e.g., its Bayesian regret grows linearly over time. In fact, such failure is a (very) typical case, not just a worst-case scenario. This conclusion persists even if an agent's per-episode utility is some fixed function of the per-round outcomes: e.g., $\min$ or $\max$, not just the sum.

Given that the latter can encompass higher technology readiness levels, which typically correlates with lower academic impact, it is interesting to understand how academic impact holds up in SFI funded research. Here we decompose SFI \textit{Investigator Awards} - arguably the most academic funding call - into $3,243$ constituent publications and field weighted citation impact (FWCI) values searchable in the SCOPUS database. Given that citation counts are skewed, we highlight the limitation of FWCI as a paper metric, which naively restricts one to comparisons of average FWCI ($\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}}$) in large samples. Neglecting publications with $\textrm{FWCI} &lt; 0.1$ ($8.8\%$), SFI funded publications are well approximated by a lognormal distribution with $\mu = -0.0761^{+0.017}_{-0.0039}$ and $ \sigma = 0.933^{+0.011}_{-0.012}$ at $95 \%$ confidence level. This equates to an $\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}} = 1.433^{+0.029}_{-0.015}$ well above $\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}}=1$ internationally. Broken down by award, we correct $\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}}$ for small samples using simulations and find $\sim 67\%$ exceed \textit{median} international academic interest, thus exhibiting a positive correlation between the potential for socioeconomic impact and academic interest.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05836v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Data Acquisition and Analytics at Synchrotron Radiation Facilities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05837</link><description>arXiv:2602.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron facilities like the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) generate massive data volumes from complex beamline experiments, but face challenges such as limited access time, the need for on-site experiment monitoring, and managing terabytes of data per user group. We present the design, deployment, and evaluation of a framework that addresses CHESS's data acquisition and management issues. Deployed on a secure CHESS server, our system provides real time, web-based tools for remote experiment monitoring and data quality assessment, improving operational efficiency. Implemented across three beamlines (ID3A, ID3B, ID4B), the framework managed 50-100 TB of data and over 10 million files in late 2024. Testing with 43 research groups and 86 dashboards showed reduced overhead, improved accessibility, and streamlined data workflows. Our paper highlights the development, deployment, and evaluation of our framework and its transformative impact on synchrotron data acquisition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05837v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FHAIM: Fully Homomorphic AIM For Private Synthetic Data Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05838</link><description>arXiv:2602.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data is the lifeblood of AI, yet much of the most valuable data remains locked in silos due to privacy and regulations. As a result, AI remains heavily underutilized in many of the most important domains, including healthcare, education, and finance. Synthetic data generation (SDG), i.e. the generation of artificial data with a synthesizer trained on real data, offers an appealing solution to make data available while mitigating privacy concerns, however existing SDG-as-a-service workflow require data holders to trust providers with access to private data.We propose FHAIM, the first fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) framework for training a marginal-based synthetic data generator on encrypted tabular data. FHAIM adapts the widely used AIM algorithm to the FHE setting using novel FHE protocols, ensuring that the private data remains encrypted throughout and is released only with differential privacy guarantees. Our empirical analysis show that FHAIM preserves the performance of AIM while maintaining feasible runtimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05838v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement World Model Learning for LLM-based Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05842</link><description>arXiv:2602.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in language-centric tasks. However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and $\tau^2$ Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and $\tau^2$ Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05842v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OdysseyArena: Benchmarking Large Language Models For Long-Horizon, Active and Inductive Interactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05843</link><description>arXiv:2602.05843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of autonomous agents capable of navigating complex environments. However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., &gt; 200 steps). Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on Siamese networks learn visual representations by aligning different views of the same image. The multi-crop strategy, which incorporates small local crops to global ones, enhances many SSL frameworks but causes instability in predictor-based architectures such as BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3. We trace this failure to the shared predictor used across all views and demonstrate that assigning a separate predictor to each view type stabilizes multi-crop training, resulting in significant performance gains. Extending this idea, we treat each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task and add cutout views, where part of the image is masked before encoding. This yields a simple multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese SSL that combines global, local, and masked views into a single framework. The approach is stable, generally applicable across backbones, and consistently improves the performance of ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OmniVideo-R1: Reinforcing Audio-visual Reasoning with Query Intention and Modality Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05847</link><description>arXiv:2602.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While humans perceive the world through diverse modalities that operate synergistically to support a holistic understanding of their surroundings, existing omnivideo models still face substantial challenges on audio-visual understanding tasks.

Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OmniVideo-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and robust generalization capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05847v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DARWIN: Dynamic Agentically Rewriting Self-Improving Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05848</link><description>arXiv:2602.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DARWIN is an evolutionary GPT model, utilizing a genetic-algorithm like optimization structure with several independent GPT agents being trained individually using unique training code. Each iteration, the GPT models are prompted to modify the training code of one another in an attempt to improve their performance in a mutation-like manner, and the best GPT agents are then benchmarked and selected for the next iteration by genetic algorithm. For demonstration purposes and due to budget and time constraints, OpenAI API is used to prompt training code improvements and the nanoGPT framework is used as the training code. DARWIN also utilizes persistent JSON-based memory files to track previous reasoning and changes to code to correlate with improvement to model performance. and a bidirectional interface for HITL intervention allowing the model to request upgrades such as additional datasets, training scripts, and restructuring of file hierarchies. In experiments, DARWIN achieved a 1.26 percent improvement in model FLOPS utilization (MFU) and a 2.07 percent improvement to perplexity in 5 iterations of training over baseline configurations, demonstrating promising capabilities as a foundation for scaling evolutionary GPT training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05848v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Visualizing the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05849</link><description>arXiv:2602.05849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training a neural network requires navigating a high-dimensional, non-convex loss surface to find parameters that minimize this loss. In many ways, it is surprising that optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent and ADAM can reliably locate minima which perform well on both the training and test data. To understand the success of training, a "loss landscape" community has emerged to study the geometry of the loss function and the dynamics of optimization, often using visualization techniques. However, these loss landscape studies have mostly been limited to machine learning for image classification. In the newer field of physics-informed machine learning, little work has been conducted to visualize the landscapes of losses defined not by regression to large data sets, but by differential operators acting on state fields discretized by neural networks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of the loss landscape literature, as well as a discussion of the few existing physics-informed works which investigate the loss landscape. We then use a number of the techniques we survey to empirically investigate the landscapes defined by the Deep Ritz and squared residual forms of the physics loss function. We find that the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks have many of the same properties as the data-driven classification problems studied in the literature. Unexpectedly, we find that the two formulations of the physics loss often give rise to similar landscapes, which appear smooth, well-conditioned, and convex in the vicinity of the solution. The purpose of this work is to introduce the loss landscape perspective to the scientific machine learning community, compare the Deep Ritz and the strong form losses, and to challenge prevailing intuitions about the complexity of the loss landscapes of physics-informed networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Equational Axiomatization of Dynamic Threads via Algebraic Effects: Presheaves on Finite Relations, Labelled Posets, and Parameterized Algebraic Theories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05850</link><description>arXiv:2602.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the theory of algebraic effects to give a complete equational axiomatization for dynamic threads. Our method is based on parameterized algebraic theories, which give a concrete syntax for strong monads on functor categories, and are a convenient framework for names and binding. Our programs are built from the key primitives `fork' and `wait'. `Fork' creates a child thread and passes its name (thread ID) to the parent thread. `Wait' allows us to wait for given child threads to finish. We provide a parameterized algebraic theory built from fork and wait, together with basic atomic actions and laws such as associativity of `fork'. Our equational axiomatization is complete in two senses. First, for closed expressions, it completely captures equality of labelled posets (pomsets), an established model of concurrency: model complete. Second, any two open expressions are provably equal if they are equal under all closing substitutions: syntactically complete. The benefit of algebraic effects is that the semantic analysis can focus on the algebraic operations of fork and wait. We then extend the analysis to a simple concurrent programming language by giving operational and denotational semantics. The denotational semantics is built using the methods of parameterized algebraic theories and we show that it is sound, adequate, and fully abstract at first order for labelled-poset observations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05850v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exact Recovery in the Data Block Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05852</link><description>arXiv:2602.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection in networks is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistical inference, with applications in social networks, biological systems, and communication networks. The stochastic block model (SBM) serves as a canonical framework for studying community structure, and exact recovery, identifying the true communities with high probability, is a central theoretical question. While classical results characterize the phase transition for exact recovery based solely on graph connectivity, many real-world networks contain additional data, such as node attributes or labels. In this work, we study exact recovery in the Data Block Model (DBM), an SBM augmented with node-associated data, as formalized by Asadi, Abbe, and Verd\'{u} (2017). We introduce the Chernoff--TV divergence and use it to characterize a sharp exact recovery threshold for the DBM. We further provide an efficient algorithm that achieves this threshold, along with a matching converse result showing impossibility below the threshold. Finally, simulations validate our findings and demonstrate the benefits of incorporating vertex data as side information in community detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05852v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RRAttention: Dynamic Block Sparse Attention via Per-Head Round-Robin Shifts for Long-Context Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05853</link><description>arXiv:2602.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses a critical bottleneck for large language models processing long contexts. While dynamic sparse attention methods offer input-adaptive efficiency, they face fundamental trade-offs: requiring preprocessing, lacking global evaluation, violating query independence, or incurring high computational overhead. We present RRAttention, a novel dynamic sparse attention method that simultaneously achieves all desirable properties through a head \underline{r}ound-\underline{r}obin (RR) sampling strategy. By rotating query sampling positions across attention heads within each stride, RRAttention maintains query independence while enabling efficient global pattern discovery with stride-level aggregation. Our method reduces complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L^2/S^2)$ and employs adaptive Top-$\tau$ selection for optimal sparsity. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding (HELMET) and multimodal video comprehension (Video-MME) demonstrate that RRAttention recovers over 99\% of full attention performance while computing only half of the attention blocks, achieving 2.4$\times$ speedup at 128K context length and outperforming existing dynamic sparse attention methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05853v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DuoDrama: Supporting Screenplay Refinement Through LLM-Assisted Human Reflection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05854</link><description>arXiv:2602.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI has been increasingly integrated into screenwriting practice. In refinement, screenwriters expect AI to provide feedback that supports reflection across the internal perspective of characters and the external perspective of the overall story. However, existing AI tools cannot sufficiently coordinate the two perspectives to meet screenwriters' needs. To address this gap, we present DuoDrama, an AI system that generates feedback to assist screenwriters' reflection in refinement. To enable DuoDrama, based on performance theories and a formative study with nine professional screenwriters, we design the Experience-Grounded Feedback Generation Workflow for Human Reflection (ExReflect). In ExReflect, an AI agent adopts an experience role to generate experience and then shifts to an evaluation role to generate feedback based on the experience. A study with fourteen professional screenwriters shows that DuoDrama improves feedback quality and alignment and enhances the effectiveness, depth, and richness of reflection. We conclude by discussing broader implications and future directions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05854v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Hybrid Autoencoder for Robust Heightmap Generation from Fused Lidar and Depth Data for Humanoid Robot Locomotion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05855</link><description>arXiv:2602.05855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable terrain perception is a critical prerequisite for the deployment of humanoid robots in unstructured, human-centric environments. While traditional systems often rely on manually engineered, single-sensor pipelines, this paper presents a learning-based framework that uses an intermediate, robot-centric heightmap representation. A hybrid Encoder-Decoder Structure (EDS) is introduced, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction fused with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) core for temporal consistency. The architecture integrates multimodal data from an Intel RealSense depth camera, a LIVOX MID-360 LiDAR processed via efficient spherical projection, and an onboard IMU. Quantitative results demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves reconstruction accuracy by 7.2% over depth-only and 9.9% over LiDAR-only configurations. Furthermore, the integration of a 3.2 s temporal context reduces mapping drift.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05855v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "It Talks Like a Patient, But Feels Different": Co-Designing AI Standardized Patients with Medical Learners</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05856</link><description>arXiv:2602.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standardized patients (SPs) play a central role in clinical communication training but are costly, difficult to scale, and inconsistent. Large language model (LLM) based AI standardized patients (AI-SPs) promise flexible, on-demand practice, yet learners often report that they talk like a patient but feel different. We interviewed 12 clinical-year medical students and conducted three co-design workshops to examine how learners experience constraints of SP encounters and what they expect from AI-SPs. We identified six learner-centered needs, translated them into AI-SP design requirements, and synthesized a conceptual workflow. Our findings position AI-SPs as tools for deliberate practice and show that instructional usability, rather than conversational realism alone, drives learner trust, engagement, and educational value.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05856v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BABE: Biology Arena BEnchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05857</link><description>arXiv:2602.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities from basic dialogue to advanced scientific reasoning. However, existing benchmarks in biology often fail to assess a critical skill required of researchers: the ability to integrate experimental results with contextual knowledge to derive meaningful conclusions. To address this gap, we introduce BABE(Biology Arena BEnchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the experimental reasoning capabilities of biological AI systems. BABE is uniquely constructed from peer-reviewed research papers and real-world biological studies, ensuring that tasks reflect the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of actual scientific inquiry. BABE challenges models to perform causal reasoning and cross-scale inference. Our benchmark provides a robust framework for assessing how well AI systems can reason like practicing scientists, offering a more authentic measure of their potential to contribute to biological research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05857v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DLM-Scope: Mechanistic Interpretability of Diffusion Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05859</link><description>arXiv:2602.05859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05859v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CFRecs: Counterfactual Recommendations on Real Estate User Listing Interaction Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05861</link><description>arXiv:2602.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous and powerful in representing complex relationships in many online platforms. While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05861v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constrained Group Relative Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05863</link><description>arXiv:2602.05863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05863v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prompting Destiny: Negotiating Socialization and Growth in an LLM-Mediated Speculative Gameworld</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05864</link><description>arXiv:2602.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an LLM-mediated role-playing game that supports reflection on socialization, moral responsibility, and educational role positioning. Grounded in socialization theory, the game follows a four-season structure in which players guide a child prince through morally charged situations and compare the LLM-mediated NPC's differentiated responses across stages, helping them reason about how educational guidance shifts with socialization. To approximate real educational contexts and reduce score-chasing, the system hides real-time evaluative scores and provides delayed, end-of-stage growth feedback as reflective prompts. We conducted a user study (N=12) with gameplay logs and post-game interviews, analyzed via reflexive thematic analysis. Findings show how players negotiated responsibility and role positioning, and reveal an entry-load tension between open-ended expression and sustained engagement. We contribute design knowledge on translating sociological models of socialization into reflective AI-mediated game systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05864v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Case of the Mysterious Citations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05867</link><description>arXiv:2602.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mysterious citations are routinely appearing in peer-reviewed publications throughout the scientific community. In this paper, we developed an automated pipeline and examine the proceedings of four major high-performance computing conferences, comparing the accuracy of citations between the 2021 and 2025 proceedings.

Abstract: Existing literature heavily relies on static analysis tools to evaluate LLMs for secure code generation and vulnerability detection. We reviewed 1,080 LLM-generated code samples, built a human-validated ground-truth, and compared the outputs of two widely used static security tools, CodeQL and Semgrep, against this corpus. While 61% of the samples were genuinely secure, Semgrep and CodeQL classified 60% and 80% as secure, respectively. Despite the apparent agreement in aggregate statistics, per-sample analysis reveals substantial discrepancies: only 65% of Semgrep's and 61% of CodeQL's reports correctly matched the ground truth. These results question the reliability of static analysis tools as sole evaluators of code security and underscore the need for expert feedback. Building on this insight, we propose a conceptual framework that persistently stores human feedback in a dynamic retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, enabling LLMs to reuse past feedback for secure code generation and vulnerability detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05868v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pathwise Test-Time Correction for Autoregressive Long Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05871</link><description>arXiv:2602.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distilled autoregressive diffusion models facilitate real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05871v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large-scale Score-based Variational Posterior Inference for Bayesian Deep Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05873</link><description>arXiv:2602.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian (deep) neural networks (BNN) are often more attractive than the mainstream point-estimate vanilla deep learning in various aspects including uncertainty quantification, robustness to noise, resistance to overfitting, and more. The variational inference (VI) is one of the most widely adopted approximate inference methods. Whereas the ELBO-based variational free energy method is a dominant choice in the literature, in this paper we introduce a score-based alternative for BNN variational inference. Although there have been quite a few score-based variational inference methods proposed in the community, most are not adequate for large-scale BNNs for various computational and technical reasons. We propose a novel scalable VI method where the learning objective combines the score matching loss and the proximal penalty term in iterations, which helps our method avoid the reparametrized sampling, and allows for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores through stochastic gradients. This in turn makes our method scalable to large-scale neural networks including Vision Transformers, and allows for richer variational density families. On several benchmarks including visual recognition and time-series forecasting with large-scale deep networks, we empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05873v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] xList-Hate: A Checklist-Based Framework for Interpretable and Generalizable Hate Speech Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05874</link><description>arXiv:2602.05874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hate speech detection is commonly framed as a direct binary classification problem despite being a composite concept defined through multiple interacting factors that vary across legal frameworks, platform policies, and annotation guidelines. As a result, supervised models often overfit dataset-specific definitions and exhibit limited robustness under domain shift and annotation noise.
  We introduce xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework that decomposes hate speech detection into a checklist of explicit, concept-level questions grounded in widely shared normative criteria. Each question is independently answered by a large language model (LLM), producing a binary diagnostic representation that captures hateful content features without directly predicting the final label. These diagnostic signals are then aggregated by a lightweight, fully interpretable decision tree, yielding transparent and auditable predictions.
  We evaluate it across multiple hate speech benchmarks and model families, comparing it against zero-shot LLM classification and in-domain supervised fine-tuning. While supervised methods typically maximize in-domain performance, we consistently improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift. In addition, qualitative analysis of disagreement cases provides evidence that the framework can be less sensitive to certain forms of annotation inconsistency and contextual ambiguity. Crucially, the approach enables fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis.
  Our results suggest that reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task, rather than a monolithic classification problem, provides a robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05874v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Manual Planning: Seating Allocation for Large Organizations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05875</link><description>arXiv:2602.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05875v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agent2Agent Threats in Safety-Critical LLM Assistants: A Human-Centric Taxonomy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05877</link><description>arXiv:2602.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05877v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EuroLLM-22B: Technical Report</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05879</link><description>arXiv:2602.05879v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Boundary detection of irregular and translucent objects is an important problem with applications in medical imaging, environmental monitoring and manufacturing, where many of these applications are plagued with scarce labeled data and low in situ computational resources. While recent image segmentation studies focus on segmentation mask alignment with ground-truth, the task of boundary detection remains understudied, especially in the low data regime. In this work, we present a lightweight discrete diffusion contour refinement pipeline for robust boundary detection in the low data regime. We use a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) architecture with self-attention layers as the core of our pipeline, and condition on a segmentation mask, iteratively denoising a sparse contour representation. We introduce multiple novel adaptations for improved low-data efficacy and inference efficiency, including using a simplified diffusion process, a customized model architecture, and minimal post processing to produce a dense, isolated contour given a dataset of size &lt;500 training images. Our method outperforms several SOTA baselines on the medical imaging dataset KVASIR, is competitive on HAM10K and our custom wildfire dataset, Smoke, while improving inference framerate by 3.5X.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EoCD: Encoder only Remote Sensing Change Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05882</link><description>arXiv:2602.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being a cornerstone of temporal analysis, change detection has been playing a pivotal role in modern earth observation. Existing change detection methods rely on the Siamese encoder to individually extract temporal features followed by temporal fusion. Subsequently, these methods design sophisticated decoders to improve the change detection performance without taking into consideration the complexity of the model. These aforementioned issues intensify the overall computational cost as well as the network's complexity which is undesirable. Alternatively, few methods utilize the early fusion scheme to combine the temporal images. These methods prevent the extra overhead of Siamese encoder, however, they also rely on sophisticated decoders for better performance. In addition, these methods demonstrate inferior performance as compared to late fusion based methods. To bridge these gaps, we introduce encoder only change detection (EoCD) that is a simple and effective method for the change detection task. The proposed method performs the early fusion of the temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module thereby significantly reducing the overall complexity of the model. EoCD demonstrate the optimal balance between the change detection performance and the prediction speed across a variety of encoder architectures. Additionally, EoCD demonstrate that the performance of the model is predominantly dependent on the encoder network, making the decoder an additional component. Extensive experimentation on four challenging change detection datasets reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05882v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Guide to Large Language Models in Modeling and Simulation: From Core Techniques to Critical Challenges</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05883</link><description>arXiv:2602.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;amp;S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&amp;amp;S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&amp;amp;S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&amp;amp;S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05883v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Implicit 3D Cardiac Shape Reconstruction from Sparse CT Angiography Slices Mimicking 2D Transthoracic Echocardiography Views</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05884</link><description>arXiv:2602.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D representations of cardiac structures allow quantitative analysis of anatomy and function. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing complete 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of sparse planes in CT angiography (CTA) for application in 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Our method uses a neural implicit function to reconstruct the 3D shape of the cardiac chambers and left-ventricle myocardium from sparse CTA planes. To investigate the feasibility of achieving 3D reconstruction from 2D TTE, we select planes that mimic the standard apical 2D TTE views. During training, a multi-layer perceptron learns shape priors from 3D segmentations of the target structures in CTA. At test time, the network reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of TTE-mimicking CTA planes by jointly optimizing the latent code and the rigid transforms that map the observed planes into 3D space. For each heart, we simulate four realistic apical views, and we compare reconstructed multi-class volumes with the reference CTA volumes. On a held-out set of CTA segmentations, our approach achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 $\pm$ 0.04 across all structures. Our method also achieves markedly lower volume errors than the clinical standard, Simpson's biplane rule: 4.88 $\pm$ 4.26 mL vs. 8.14 $\pm$ 6.04 mL, respectively, for the left ventricle; and 6.40 $\pm$ 7.37 mL vs. 37.76 $\pm$ 22.96 mL, respectively, for the left atrium. This suggests that our approach offers a viable route to more accurate 3D chamber quantification in 2D transthoracic echocardiography.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05884v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dr. Kernel: Reinforcement Learning Done Right for Triton Kernel Generations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05885</link><description>arXiv:2602.05885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05887v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Metric Hedonic Games on the Line</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05888</link><description>arXiv:2602.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hedonic games are fundamental models for investigating the formation of coalitions among a set of strategic agents, where every agent has a certain utility for every possible coalition of agents it can be part of. To avoid the intractability of defining exponentially many utilities for all possible coalitions, many variants with succinct representations of the agents' utility functions have been devised and analyzed, e.g., modified fractional hedonic games by Monaco et al. [JAAMAS 2020]. We extend this by studying a novel succinct variant that is related to modified fractional hedonic games. In our model, each agent has a fixed type-value and an agent's cost for some given coalition is based on the differences between its value and those of the other members of its coalition. This allows to model natural situations like athletes forming training groups with similar performance levels or voters that partition themselves along a political spectrum.
  In particular, we investigate natural variants where an agent's cost is defined by distance thresholds, or by the maximum or average value difference to the other agents in its coalition. For these settings, we study the existence of stable coalition structures, their properties, and their quality in terms of the price of anarchy and the price of stability. Further, we investigate the impact of limiting the maximum number of coalitions. Despite the simple setting with metric distances on a line, we uncover a rich landscape of models, partially with counter-intuitive behavior. Also, our focus on both swap stability and jump stability allows us to study the influence of fixing the number and the size of the coalitions. Overall, we find that stable coalition structures always exist but that their properties and quality can vary widely.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05888v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DFPO: Scaling Value Modeling via Distributional Flow towards Robust and Generalizable LLM Post-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05890</link><description>arXiv:2602.05890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05890v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Elo Lies: Hidden Biases in Codeforces-Based Evaluation of Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05891</link><description>arXiv:2602.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve breakthroughs in complex reasoning, Codeforces-based Elo ratings have emerged as a prominent metric for evaluating competitive programming capabilities. However, these ratings are often reported without critical experimental details, leading to significant discrepancies illustrated by recent reports where the score of the same model version fluctuated by nearly 500 points. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on the hidden factors biasing Elo evaluations: (1) the temporal ordering of submissions, (2) contest difficulty selection, and (3) run to run stochastic variability of LLMs. Utilizing a controlled benchmark of 37 recent Codeforces contests and 13,691 generated test cases, we demonstrate that Elo scores are highly sensitive to these parameters. Our findings reveal that varying submission orders can shift scores by 394 points, while contest selection can cause differences of up to 1,122 points for the same model. Run to run performance exhibits substantial instability, with a maximum difference of 349 points in mean scores observed when evaluating identical contests. We conclude that direct Elo comparisons are unreliable and potentially misleading without strict standardization and transparent reporting of experimental settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05891v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ContextBench: A Benchmark for Context Retrieval in Coding Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05892</link><description>arXiv:2602.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based coding agents have shown strong performance on automated issue resolution benchmarks, yet existing evaluations largely focus on final task success, providing limited insight into how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving. We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval ("The Bitter Lesson" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process. These contexts offer valuable intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks.

Abstract: This paper studies the container lifting phase of a waste-container recycling task in urban environments, performed by a hydraulic loader crane equipped with an underactuated discharge unit, and proposes a residual reinforcement learning (RRL) approach that combines a nominal Cartesian controller with a learned residual policy. All experiments are conducted in simulation, where the task is characterized by tight geometric tolerances between the discharge-unit hooks and the container rings relative to the overall crane scale, making precise trajectory tracking and swing suppression essential. The nominal controller uses admittance control for trajectory tracking and pendulum-aware swing damping, followed by damped least-squares inverse kinematics with a nullspace posture term to generate joint velocity commands. A PPO-trained residual policy in Isaac Lab compensates for unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations, improving precision and robustness without requiring end-to-end learning from scratch. We further employ randomized episode initialization and domain randomization over payload properties, actuator gains, and passive joint parameters to enhance generalization. Simulation results demonstrate improved tracking accuracy, reduced oscillations, and higher lifting success rates compared to the nominal controller alone.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05895v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parity, Sensitivity, and Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05896</link><description>arXiv:2602.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformer architecture is almost a decade old. Despite that, we still have a limited understanding of what this architecture can or cannot compute. For instance, can a 1-layer transformer solve PARITY -- or more generally -- which kinds of transformers can do it? Known constructions for PARITY have at least 2 layers and employ impractical features: either a length-dependent positional encoding, or hardmax, or layernorm without the regularization parameter, or they are not implementable with causal masking.
  We give a new construction of a transformer for PARITY with softmax, length-independent and polynomially bounded positional encoding, no layernorm, working both with and without causal masking. We also give the first lower bound for transformers solving PARITY -- by showing that it cannot be done with only one layer and one head.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05896v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stop Rewarding Hallucinated Steps: Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning for Small Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05897</link><description>arXiv:2602.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models become smaller and more efficient, small reasoning models (SRMs) are crucial for enabling chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in resource-constrained settings. However, they are prone to faithfulness hallucinations, especially in intermediate reasoning steps. Existing mitigation methods based on online reinforcement learning rely on outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained CoT evaluation, which can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when the final answer is correct. To address these limitations, we propose Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), introducing step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model, together with an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive signals from faithful prefixes. Experiments across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrate that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05902v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Verification of the Implicit World Model in a Generative Model via Adversarial Sequences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05903</link><description>arXiv:2602.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05903v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improved SDP-Based Algorithm for Coloring 3-Colorable Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05904</link><description>arXiv:2602.05904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a polynomial-time algorithm that colors any 3-colorable $n$-vertex graph using $O(n^{0.19539})$ colors, improving upon the previous best bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{0.19747})$ by Kawarabayashi, Thorup, and Yoneda [STOC 2024].

  The earlier SDP-based algorithms of Arora, Chlamt\'a\v{c}, and Charikar [STOC 2006] and Chlamt\'a\v{c} [FOCS 2007] rely on extracting a large independent set from a suitably "random-looking" second-level neighborhood, under the assumption that the KMS algorithm [Karger, Motwani, and Sudan, JACM 1998] fails to find one globally. We extend their analysis to third-level neighborhoods. We then come up with a new vector $5/2$-coloring, which allows us to extract a large independent set from some third-level neighborhood. The new vector coloring construction may be of independent interest.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05904v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Codified Finite-state Machines for Role-playing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05905</link><description>arXiv:2602.05905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling latent character states is crucial for consistent and engaging role-playing (RP) with large language models (LLMs). Yet, existing prompting-based approaches mainly capture surface actions, often failing to track the latent states that drive interaction. We revisit finite-state machines (FSMs), long used in game design to model state transitions. While effective in small, well-specified state spaces, traditional hand-crafted, rule-based FSMs struggle to adapt to the open-ended semantic space of RP. To address this, we introduce Codified Finite-State Machines (CFSMs), a framework that automatically codifies textual character profiles into FSMs using LLM-based coding. CFSMs extract key states and transitions directly from the profile, producing interpretable structures that enforce character consistency. To further capture uncertainty and variability, we extend CFSMs into Codified Probabilistic Finite-State Machines (CPFSMs), where transitions are modeled as probability distributions over states. Through both synthetic evaluations and real-world RP scenarios in established artifacts, we demonstrate that CFSM and CPFSM outperform generally applied baselines, verifying effectiveness not only in structured tasks but also in open-ended stochastic state exploration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05905v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CLIP-Map: Structured Matrix Mapping for Parameter-Efficient CLIP Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05909</link><description>arXiv:2602.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved widely applications in various computer vision tasks, e.g., text-to-image generation, Image-Text retrieval and Image captioning. However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05909v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chunky Post-Training: Data Driven Failures of Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05910</link><description>arXiv:2602.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM post-training involves many diverse datasets, each targeting a specific behavior. But these datasets encode incidental patterns alongside intended ones: correlations between formatting and content, narrow phrasings across diverse problems, and implicit associations arising from the discrete data curation process. These patterns are often invisible to developers yet salient to models, producing behaviors that surprise their creators, such as rejecting true facts presented in a particular question format. We call this chunky post-training: the model learns spurious correlations as a result of distinct chunks of post-training data. We introduce SURF, a black-box pipeline which surfaces these unintended behaviors at run time, and TURF, a tool that traces these failures back to specific post-training data. Applying these tools to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (T\"ulu 3), we show that chunky post-training produces miscalibrated behaviors, which often result from imbalanced or underspecified chunks of post-training data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05910v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Reinforcement Learning with Transformers for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05920</link><description>arXiv:2602.05920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05920v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Bench to Flight: Translating Drone Impact Tests into Operational Safety Limits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05922</link><description>arXiv:2602.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) are increasingly used for tasks that require close proximity to people, yet practitioners lack practical methods to tune motion limits based on measured impact risk. We present an end-to-end, open toolchain that converts benchtop impact tests into deployable safety governors for drones. First, we describe a compact and replicable impact rig and protocol for capturing force-time profiles across drone classes and contact surfaces. Second, we provide data-driven models that map pre-impact speed to impulse and contact duration, enabling direct computation of speed bounds for a target force limit. Third, we release scripts and a ROS2 node that enforce these bounds online and log compliance, with support for facility-specific policies. We validate the workflow on multiple commercial off-the-shelf quadrotors and representative indoor assets, demonstrating that the derived governors preserve task throughput while meeting force constraints specified by safety stakeholders. Our contribution is a practical bridge from measured impacts to runtime limits, with shareable datasets, code, and a repeatable process that teams can adopt to certify indoor MAV operations near humans.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05922v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Hashing: Faster Hash Functions with Fewer Collisions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05925</link><description>arXiv:2602.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hash tables are ubiquitous, and the choice of hash function, which maps a key to a bucket, is key to their performance. We argue that the predominant approach of fixing the hash function for the lifetime of the hash table is suboptimal and propose adapting it to the current set of keys. In the prevailing view, good hash functions spread the keys ``randomly'' and are fast to evaluate. General-purpose ones (e.g. Murmur) are designed to do both while remaining agnostic to the distribution of the keys, which limits their bucketing ability and wastes computation. When these shortcomings are recognized, one may specify a hash function more tailored to some assumed key distribution, but doing so almost always introduces an unbounded risk in case this assumption does not bear out in practice. At the other, fully key-aware end of the spectrum, Perfect Hashing algorithms can discover hash functions to bucket a given set of keys optimally, but they are costly to run and require the keys to be known and fixed ahead of time. Our main conceptual contribution is that adapting the hash table's hash function to the keys online is necessary for the best performance, as adaptivity allows for better bucketing of keys \emph{and} faster hash functions. We instantiate the idea of online adaptation with minimal overhead and no change to the hash table API. The experiments show that the adaptive approach marries the common-case performance of weak hash functions with the robustness of general-purpose ones.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Even Faster Geosocial Reachability Queries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05928</link><description>arXiv:2602.05928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geosocial reachability queries (\textsc{RangeReach}) determine whether a given vertex in a geosocial network can reach any spatial vertex within a query region. The state-of-the-art 3DReach method answers such queries by encoding graph reachability through interval labelling and indexing spatial vertices in a 3D R-tree. We present 2DReach, a simpler approach that avoids interval labelling entirely. Like 3DReach, 2DReach collapses strongly connected components (SCCs) into a DAG, but instead of computing interval labels, it directly stores a 2D R-tree per component over all reachable spatial vertices. A query then reduces to a single 2D R-tree lookup. We further propose compressed variants that reduce storage by excluding spatial sinks and sharing R-trees between components with identical reachable sets. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that 2DReach achieves faster index construction than 3DReach, with the compressed variant yielding the smallest index size among all methods. 2DReach delivers competitive or superior query performance with more stable response times across varying query parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05928v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KV-CoRE: Benchmarking Data-Dependent Low-Rank Compressibility of KV-Caches in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05929</link><description>arXiv:2602.05929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models rely on kv-caches to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive decoding, but as context length grows, reading and writing the cache can quickly saturate GPU memory bandwidth. Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05929v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Compound Deception in Elite Peer Review: A Failure Mode Taxonomy of 100 Fabricated Citations at NeurIPS 2025</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05930</link><description>arXiv:2602.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in academic writing workflows, yet they frequently hallucinate by generating citations to sources that do not exist. This study analyzes 100 AI-generated hallucinated citations that appeared in papers accepted by the 2025 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), one of the world's most prestigious AI conferences. Despite review by 3-5 expert researchers per paper, these fabricated citations evaded detection, appearing in 53 published papers (approx. 1% of all accepted papers). We develop a five-category taxonomy that classifies hallucinations by their failure mode: Total Fabrication (66%), Partial Attribute Corruption (27%), Identifier Hijacking (4%), Placeholder Hallucination (2%), and Semantic Hallucination (1%). Our analysis reveals a critical finding: every hallucination (100%) exhibited compound failure modes. The distribution of secondary characteristics was dominated by Semantic Hallucination (63%) and Identifier Hijacking (29%), which often appeared alongside Total Fabrication to create a veneer of plausibility and false verifiability. These compound structures exploit multiple verification heuristics simultaneously, explaining why peer review fails to detect them. The distribution exhibits a bimodal pattern: 92% of contaminated papers contain 1-2 hallucinations (minimal AI use) while 8% contain 4-13 hallucinations (heavy reliance). These findings demonstrate that current peer review processes do not include effective citation verification and that the problem extends beyond NeurIPS to other major conferences, government reports, and professional consulting. We propose mandatory automated citation verification at submission as an implementable solution to prevent fabricated citations from becoming normalized in scientific literature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05930v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Task-Adaptive Physical Reservoir Computing via Tunable Molecular Communication Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05931</link><description>arXiv:2602.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC) offers an efficient paradigm for processing temporal data, yet most physical implementations are static, limiting their performance to a narrow range of tasks. In this work, we demonstrate in silico that a canonical Molecular Communication (MC) channel can function as a highly versatile and task-adaptive PRC whose computational properties are reconfigurable. Using a dual-simulation approach -- a computationally efficient deterministic mean-field model and a high-fidelity particle-based stochastic model (Smoldyn) -- we show that tuning the channel's underlying biophysical parameters, such as ligand-receptor kinetics and diffusion dynamics, allows the reservoir to be optimized for distinct classes of computation. We employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently navigate this high-dimensional parameter space, identifying discrete operational regimes. Our results reveal a clear trade-off: parameter sets rich in channel memory excel at chaotic time-series forecasting tasks (e.g., Mackey Glass), while regimes that promote strong receptor nonlinearity are superior for nonlinear data transformation. We further demonstrate that post-processing methods improve the performance of the stochastic reservoir by mitigating intrinsic molecular noise. These findings establish the MC channel not merely as a computational substrate, but as a design blueprint for tunable, bioinspired computing systems, providing a clear optimization framework for future wetware AI implementations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05931v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Polyglots or Multitudes?

Abstract: Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are often used to assess knowledge, reasoning abilities, and even values encoded in large language models (LLMs). While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05932v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Approximation of Log-Partition Function in Policy Mirror Descent Induces Implicit Regularization for LLM Post-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05933</link><description>arXiv:2602.05933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$\chi^2$ regularizer. This additional $\chi^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tuning Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detectors Without Given OOD Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05935</link><description>arXiv:2602.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors are often tuned by a separate dataset deemed OOD with respect to the training distribution of a neural network (NN). OOD detectors process the activations of NN layers and score the output, where parameters of the detectors are determined by fitting to an in-distribution (training) set and the aforementioned dataset chosen adhocly. At detector training time, this adhoc dataset may not be available or difficult to obtain, and even when it's available, it may not be representative of actual OOD data, which is often ''unknown unknowns." Current benchmarks may specify some left-out set from test OOD sets. We show that there can be significant variance in performance of detectors based on the adhoc dataset chosen in current literature, and thus even if such a dataset can be collected, the performance of the detector may be highly dependent on the choice. In this paper, we introduce and formalize the often neglected problem of tuning OOD detectors without a given ``OOD'' dataset. To this end, we present strong baselines as an attempt to approach this problem. Furthermore, we propose a new generic approach to OOD detector tuning that does not require any extra data other than those used to train the NN. We show that our approach improves over baseline methods consistently across higher-parameter OOD detector families, while being comparable across lower-parameter families.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05935v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dimensionality Reduction on Riemannian Manifolds in Data Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05936</link><description>arXiv:2602.05936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate Riemannian geometry based dimensionality reduction methods that respect the underlying manifold structure of the data.

These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages. Experimental results on representative datasets demonstrate that Riemannian methods provide improved representation quality and classification performance compared to their Euclidean counterparts, especially for data constrained to curved spaces such as hyperspheres and symmetric positive definite manifolds. This study underscores the importance of geometry aware dimensionality reduction in modern machine learning and data science applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05936v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning for Continual Test-time Adaptation in Medical Image Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05937</link><description>arXiv:2602.05937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution shift is a common challenge in medical images obtained from different clinical centers, significantly hindering the deployment of pre-trained semantic segmentation models in real-world applications across multiple domains. Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05937v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Improving Multilingual Long Reasoning via Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05940</link><description>arXiv:2602.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long reasoning models often struggle in multilingual settings: they tend to reason in English for non-English questions; when constrained to reasoning in the question language, accuracies drop substantially. The struggle is caused by the limited abilities for both multilingual question understanding and multilingual reasoning. To address both problems, we propose TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training), a self-improving framework that integrates the training of translation into multilingual reasoning. Without external feedback or additional multilingual data, our method jointly enhances multilingual question understanding and response generation.

Abstract: Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Detective Work We Shouldn't Have to Do": Practitioner Challenges in Regulatory-Aligned Data Quality in Machine Learning Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05944</link><description>arXiv:2602.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring data quality in machine learning (ML) systems has become increasingly complex as regulatory requirements expand. In the European Union (EU), frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) articulate data quality requirements that closely parallel technical concerns in ML practice, while also extending to legal obligations related to accountability, risk management, and human rights protection. This paper presents a qualitative interview study with EU-based data practitioners working on ML systems in regulated contexts. Through semi-structured interviews, we investigate how practitioners interpret regulatory-aligned data quality, the challenges they encounter, and the supports they identify as necessary. Our findings reveal persistent gaps between legal principles and engineering workflows, fragmentation across data pipelines, limitations of existing tools, unclear responsibility boundaries between technical and legal teams, and a tendency toward reactive, audit-driven quality practices. We also identify practitioners' needs for compliance-aware tooling, clearer governance structures, and cultural shifts toward proactive data governance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05944v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgenticTagger: Structured Item Representation for Recommendation with LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05945</link><description>arXiv:2602.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality representations are a core requirement for effective recommendation. In this work, we study the problem of LLM-based descriptor generation, i.e., keyphrase-like natural language item representation generation frameworks with minimal constraints on downstream applications. We propose AgenticTagger, a framework that queries LLMs for representing items with sequences of text descriptors. However, open-ended generation provides little control over the generation space, leading to high cardinality, low-performance descriptors that renders downstream modeling challenging. To this end, AgenticTagger features two core stages: (1) a vocabulary building stage where a set of hierarchical, low-cardinality, and high-quality descriptors is identified, and (2) a vocabulary assignment stage where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items. To effectively and efficiently ground vocabulary in the item corpus of interest, we design a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines the vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs that validates the vocabulary against item data. Experiments on public and private data show AgenticTagger brings consistent improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios, including generative and term-based retrieval, ranking, and controllability-oriented, critique-based recommendation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05945v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] $f$-GRPO and Beyond: Divergence-Based Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for General LLM Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05946</link><description>arXiv:2602.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05946v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Location-Aware Dispersion on Anonymous Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05948</link><description>arXiv:2602.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-studied DISPERSION problem is a fundamental coordination problem in distributed robotics, where a set of mobile robots must relocate so that each occupies a distinct node of a network. DISPERSION assumes that a robot can settle at any node as long as no other robot settles on that node. In this work, we introduce LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION that incorporates location awareness: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an anonymous, connected, undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes, each labeled with a color $\sf{col}(v) \in C = \{c_1, \dots, c_t\}, t\leq n$. A set $R = \{r_1, \dots, r_k\}$ of $k \leq n$ mobile robots is given, where each robot $r_i$ has an associated color $\mathsf{col}(r_i) \in C$. Initially placed arbitrarily on the graph, the goal is to relocate the robots so that each occupies a distinct node of the same color. When $|C|=1$, LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION reduces to DISPERSION. There is a solution to DISPERSION in graphs with any $k\leq n$ without knowing $k,n$.
  Like DISPERSION, the goal is to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION minimizing both time and memory requirement at each agent. We develop several deterministic algorithms with guaranteed bounds on both time and memory requirement. We also give an impossibility and a lower bound for any deterministic algorithm for LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION. To the best of our knowledge, the presented results collectively establish the algorithmic feasibility of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION in anonymous networks and also highlight the challenges on getting an efficient solution compared to the solutions for DISPERSION.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05948v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking Symmetry Bottlenecks in GNN Readouts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05950</link><description>arXiv:2602.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning on structured data, yet their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is fundamentally limited. These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05950v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Better Source, Better Flow: Learning Condition-Dependent Source Distribution for Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05951</link><description>arXiv:2602.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, particularly for text-to-image generation. Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating conditioning into the source, including distributional collapse and instability, and show that appropriate variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target are critical for stable and effective learning. We further analyze how the choice of target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources, revealing regimes in which such designs are most effective. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate consistent and robust improvements, including up to a 3x faster convergence in FID, highlighting the practical benefits of a principled source distribution design for conditional flow matching.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05951v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spectral Analysis of Block Diagonally Preconditioned Multiple Saddle-Point Matrices with Inexact Schur Complements</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05952</link><description>arXiv:2602.05952v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Sampling from a distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-\mathcal{E}(x)}$ known up to a normalising constant is an important and challenging problem in statistics. Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schr\"odinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05961v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Share: Selective Memory for Efficient Parallel Agentic Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05965</link><description>arXiv:2602.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic systems solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents that iteratively reason, invoke tools, and exchange intermediate results. To improve robustness and solution quality, recent approaches deploy multiple agent teams running in parallel to explore diverse reasoning trajectories. However, parallel execution comes at a significant computational cost: when different teams independently reason about similar sub-problems or execute analogous steps, they repeatedly perform substantial overlapping computation. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose Learning to Share (LTS), a learned shared-memory mechanism for parallel agentic frameworks that enables selective cross-team information reuse while controlling context growth. LTS introduces a global memory bank accessible to all teams and a lightweight controller that decides whether intermediate agent steps should be added to memory or not. The controller is trained using stepwise reinforcement learning with usage-aware credit assignment, allowing it to identify information that is globally useful across parallel executions. Experiments on the AssistantBench and GAIA benchmarks show that LTS significantly reduces overall runtime while matching or improving task performance compared to memory-free parallel baselines, demonstrating that learned memory admission is an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of parallel agentic systems.

Abstract: Controllable video generation has emerged as a versatile tool for autonomous driving, enabling realistic synthesis of traffic scenarios. However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05966v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Hybrid Data-Driven Algorithm for Real-Time Friction Force Estimation in Hydraulic Cylinders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05967</link><description>arXiv:2602.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydraulic systems are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high force generation, precise control, and ability to function in harsh environments. Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05967v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inverse Depth Scaling From Most Layers Being Similar</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05970</link><description>arXiv:2602.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws relate loss to model size in large language models (LLMs), yet depth and width may contribute to performance differently, requiring more detailed studies. Here, we quantify how depth affects loss via analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks. We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics. This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. The findings suggest that improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05970v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Characterizing Human Semantic Navigation in Concept Production as Trajectories in Embedding Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05971</link><description>arXiv:2602.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05971v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAGE: Benchmarking and Improving Retrieval for Deep Research Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05975</link><description>arXiv:2602.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep research agents have emerged as powerful systems for addressing complex queries. Meanwhile, LLM-based retrievers have demonstrated strong capability in following instructions or reasoning. This raises a critical question: can LLM-based retrievers effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows? To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000 paper retrieval corpus.We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e., ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. This yields 8% and 2% gains on short-form and open-ended questions, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05975v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Clifford Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05977</link><description>arXiv:2602.05977v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05983v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RISE-Video: Can Video Generators Decode Implicit World Rules?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05986</link><description>arXiv:2602.05986v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM) agents enables us to build agent-based intelligent systems that move beyond the role of a "tool" to become genuine collaborators with humans, thereby realizing a novel human-agent collaboration paradigm. Our vision is that LLM agents should resemble remote human collaborators, which allows HCI researchers to ground the future exploration in decades of research on trust, awareness, and common ground in remote human collaboration, while also revealing the unique opportunities and challenges that emerge when one or more partners are AI agents. This workshop establishes a foundational research agenda for the new era by posing the question: How can the rich understanding of remote human collaboration inspire and inform the design and study of human-agent collaboration? We will bring together an interdisciplinary group from HCI, CSCW, and AI to explore this critical transition. The 180-minute workshop will be highly interactive, featuring a keynote speaker, a series of invited lightning talks, and an exploratory group design session where participants will storyboard novel paradigms of human-agent partnership.

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

However, the widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule is agnostic to semantic difficulty, making it a suboptimal strategy for both quality and efficiency: it can force premature commitments to uncertain positions while delaying easy positions near block boundaries. In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference. Motivated by this, we propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of the naive block. To further improve efficiency, we introduce DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DSB, together with DSB Cache, consistently improves both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05992v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diamond Maps: Efficient Reward Alignment via Stochastic Flow Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05993</link><description>arXiv:2602.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose "Diamond Maps", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods. Our results point toward a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05993v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Orthogonal Self-Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05996</link><description>arXiv:2602.05996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05996v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VisRefiner: Learning from Visual Differences for Screenshot-to-Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05998</link><description>arXiv:2602.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Screenshot-to-code generation aims to translate user interface screenshots into executable frontend code that faithfully reproduces the target layout and style. Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05998v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On Computation and Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05999</link><description>arXiv:2602.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does the amount of compute available to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy affect its learning? Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05999v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Speech Emotion Recognition Leveraging OpenAI's Whisper Representations and Attentive Pooling Methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06000</link><description>arXiv:2602.06000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research has faced limitations due to the lack of standard and sufficiently large datasets. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06000v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Visuo-Tactile World Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06001</link><description>arXiv:2602.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce multi-task Visuo-Tactile World Models (VT-WM), which capture the physics of contact through touch reasoning. By complementing vision with tactile sensing, VT-WM better understands robot-object interactions in contact-rich tasks, avoiding common failure modes of vision-only models under occlusion or ambiguous contact states, such as objects disappearing, teleporting, or moving in ways that violate basic physics. Trained across a set of contact-rich manipulation tasks, VT-WM improves physical fidelity in imagination, achieving 33% better performance at maintaining object permanence and 29% better compliance with the laws of motion in autoregressive rollouts. Moreover, experiments show that grounding in contact dynamics also translates to planning. In zero-shot real-robot experiments, VT-WM achieves up to 35% higher success rates, with the largest gains in multi-step, contact-rich tasks. Finally, VT-WM demonstrates significant downstream versatility, effectively adapting its learned contact dynamics to a novel task and achieving reliable planning success with only a limited set of demonstrations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Supply vs. Demand in Community-Based Fact-Checking on Social Media</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06005</link><description>arXiv:2602.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fact-checking ecosystems on social media depend on the interplay between what users want checked and what contributors are willing to supply. Prior research has largely examined these forces in isolation, yet it remains unclear to what extent supply meets demand. We address this gap with an empirical analysis of a unique dataset of 1.1 million fact-checks and fact-checking requests from X's Community Notes platform between June 2024 and May 2025. We find that requests disproportionately target highly visible posts - those with more views and engagement and authored by influential accounts - whereas fact-checks are distributed more broadly across languages, sentiments, and topics. Using a quasi-experimental survival analysis, we further estimate the effect of displaying requests on subsequent note creation. Results show that requests significantly accelerate contributions from Top Writers. Altogether, our findings highlight a gap between the content that attracts requests for fact-checking and the content that ultimately receives fact-checks, while showing that user requests can steer contributors toward greater alignment. These insights carry important implications for platform governance and future research on online misinformation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06005v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgenticPay: A Multi-Agent LLM Negotiation System for Buyer-Seller Transactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06008</link><description>arXiv:2602.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly expected to negotiate, coordinate, and transact autonomously, yet existing benchmarks lack principled settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents. We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone. The framework supports a diverse suite of over 110 tasks ranging from bilateral bargaining to many-to-many markets, with structured action extraction and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare. Benchmarking state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning, establishing AgenticPay as a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

Abstract: GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) have become a central component of open-source vulnerability disclosure and are widely used by developers and security tools. A distinctive feature of GHSA is that only a fraction of advisories are reviewed by GitHub, while the mechanisms associated with this review process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of GHSA review processes, analyzing over 288,000 advisories spanning 2019--2025. We characterize which advisories are more likely to be reviewed, quantify review delays, and identify two distinct review-latency regimes: a fast path dominated by GitHub Repository Advisories (GRAs) and a slow path dominated by NVD-first advisories. We further develop a queueing model that accounts for this dichotomy based on the structure of the advisory processing pipeline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06009v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GenArena: How Can We Achieve Human-Aligned Evaluation for Visual Generation Tasks?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06013</link><description>arXiv:2602.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of visual generation models has outpaced traditional evaluation approaches, necessitating the adoption of Vision-Language Models as surrogate judges. In this work, we systematically investigate the reliability of the prevailing absolute pointwise scoring standard, across a wide spectrum of visual generation tasks. Our analysis reveals that this paradigm is limited due to stochastic inconsistency and poor alignment with human perception. To resolve these limitations, we introduce GenArena, a unified evaluation framework that leverages a pairwise comparison paradigm to ensure stable and human-aligned evaluation. Crucially, our experiments uncover a transformative finding that simply adopting this pairwise protocol enables off-the-shelf open-source models to outperform top-tier proprietary models. Notably, our method boosts evaluation accuracy by over 20% and achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.86 with the authoritative LMArena leaderboard, drastically surpassing the 0.36 correlation of pointwise methods. Based on GenArena, we benchmark state-of-the-art visual generation models across diverse tasks, providing the community with a rigorous and automated evaluation standard for visual generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06013v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimism Stabilizes Thompson Sampling for Adaptive Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06014</link><description>arXiv:2602.06014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion. In summary, suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits, while incurring only a mild additional regret cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Systematic Evaluation of Large Language Models for PTSD Severity Estimation: The Role of Contextual Knowledge and Modeling Strategies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06015</link><description>arXiv:2602.06015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in a zero-shot fashion to assess mental health conditions, yet we have limited knowledge on what factors affect their accuracy. In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods. Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06015v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MambaVF: State Space Model for Efficient Video Fusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06017</link><description>arXiv:2602.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video fusion is a fundamental technique in various video processing tasks. However, existing video fusion methods heavily rely on optical flow estimation and feature warping, resulting in severe computational overhead and limited scalability. This paper presents MambaVF, an efficient video fusion framework based on state space models (SSMs) that performs temporal modeling without explicit motion estimation. First, by reformulating video fusion as a sequential state update process, MambaVF captures long-range temporal dependencies with linear complexity while significantly reducing computation and memory costs. Second, MambaVF proposes a lightweight SSM-based fusion module that replaces conventional flow-guided alignment via a spatio-temporal bidirectional scanning mechanism. This module enables efficient information aggregation across frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our MambaVF achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared-visible, and medical video fusion tasks. We highlight that MambaVF enjoys high efficiency, reducing up to 92.25% of parameters and 88.79% of computational FLOPs and a 2.1x speedup compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This study is a first step towards using data-informed differential models to predict and control the dynamics of cancer-on-chip experiments. We consider a conceptualized one-dimensional device, containing a cancer and a population of white blood cells. The interaction between the cancer and the population of cells is modeled by a chemotaxis model inspired by Keller-Segel-type equations, which is solved by a Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin method. Our goal is using (synthetic) data to tune the parameters of the governing equations and to assess the uncertainty on the predictions of the dynamics due to the residual uncertainty on the parameters remaining after the tuning procedure. To this end, we apply techniques from uncertainty quantification for parametric differential models. We first perform a global sensitivity analysis using both Sobol and Morris indices to assess how parameter uncertainty impacts model predictions, and fix the value of parameters with negligible impact. Subsequently, we conduct an inverse uncertainty quantification analysis by Bayesian techniques to compute a data-informed probability distribution of the remaining model parameters. Finally, we carry out a forward uncertainty quantification analysis to compute the impact of the updated (residual) parametric uncertainties on the quantities of interest of the model. The whole procedure is sped up by using surrogate models, based on sparse-grids, to approximate the mapping of the uncertain parameters to the quantities of interest.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Token Prediction via Self-Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06019</link><description>arXiv:2602.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing techniques for accelerating language model inference, such as speculative decoding, require training auxiliary speculator models and building and deploying complex inference pipelines. We consider a new approach for converting a pretrained autoregressive language model from a slow single next token prediction model into a fast standalone multi-token prediction model using a simple online distillation objective. The final model retains the exact same implementation as the pretrained initial checkpoint and is deployable without the addition of any auxiliary verifier or other specialized inference code. On GSM8K, our method produces models that can decode more than $3\times$ faster on average at $&lt;5\%$ drop in accuracy relative to single token decoding performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens (CORAL): Transferrable and Calibration-Aware Inference-Time Steering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06022</link><description>arXiv:2602.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit persistent miscalibration, especially after instruction tuning and preference alignment. Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\% accuracy improvements and 49\% ECE improvements. Our results support the hypothesis that distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL thus provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06022v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Query-Aware Budget-Tier Routing for Runtime Agent Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06025</link><description>arXiv:2602.06025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \textsc{Low}/\textsc{Mid}/\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06025v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GUARDIAN: Safety Filtering for Systems with Perception Models Subject to Adversarial Attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06026</link><description>arXiv:2602.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety filtering is an effective method for enforcing constraints in safety-critical systems, but existing methods typically assume perfect state information. This limitation is especially problematic for systems that rely on neural network (NN)-based state estimators, which can be highly sensitive to noise and adversarial input perturbations. We address these problems by introducing GUARDIAN: Guaranteed Uncertainty-Aware Reachability Defense against Adversarial INterference, a safety filtering framework that provides formal safety guarantees for systems with NN-based state estimators. At runtime, GUARDIAN uses neural network verification tools to provide guaranteed bounds on the system's state estimate given possible perturbations to its observation. It then uses a modified Hamilton-Jacobi reachability formulation to construct a safety filter that adjusts the nominal control input based on the verified state bounds and safety constraints. The result is an uncertainty-aware filter that ensures safety despite the system's reliance on an NN estimator with noisy, possibly adversarial, input observations. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that GUARDIAN effectively defends systems against adversarial attacks that would otherwise lead to a violation of safety constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context Forcing: Consistent Autoregressive Video Generation with Long Context</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06028</link><description>arXiv:2602.06028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent approaches to real-time long video generation typically employ streaming tuning strategies, attempting to train a long-context student using a short-context (memoryless) teacher. In these frameworks, the student performs long rollouts but receives supervision from a teacher limited to short 5-second windows. This structural discrepancy creates a critical \textbf{student-teacher mismatch}: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global temporal dependencies, effectively capping the student's context length. To resolve this, we propose \textbf{Context Forcing}, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06028v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Curiosity is Knowledge: Self-Consistent Learning and No-Regret Optimization with Active Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06029</link><description>arXiv:2602.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertainty resolution, while excessive curiosity can induce unnecessary exploration and regret. We establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that a single requirement--sufficient curiosity--simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Our analysis characterizes how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, thereby connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework.

We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06030v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AP-OOD: Attention Pooling for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06031</link><description>arXiv:2602.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which maps high-dimensional data into a scalar OOD score, is critical for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. A key challenge in recent research is how to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain the OOD score. In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes beyond simple average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information. AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, enabling the use of limited auxiliary outlier data. Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06031v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Splat and Distill: Augmenting Teachers with Feed-Forward 3D Reconstruction For 3D-Aware Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06032</link><description>arXiv:2602.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have achieved remarkable success when applied to various downstream 2D tasks. Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models do not have good intuitions about the physical world. Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06033v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] V-Retrver: Evidence-Driven Agentic Reasoning for Universal Multimodal Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06034</link><description>arXiv:2602.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06034v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] InterPrior: Scaling Generative Control for Physics-Based Human-Object Interactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06035</link><description>arXiv:2602.06035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06035v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DFlash: Block Diffusion for Flash Speculative Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06036</link><description>arXiv:2602.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but require inherently sequential decoding, leading to high inference latency and poor GPU utilization. Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06036v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Thinking with Geometry: Active Geometry Integration for Spatial Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06037</link><description>arXiv:2602.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence.

Abstract: To complete assignments provided by humans in natural language, robots must interpret commands, generate and answer relevant questions for scene understanding, and manipulate target objects. Real-world deployments often require multiple heterogeneous robots with different manipulation capabilities to handle different assignments cooperatively. Beyond the need for specialized manipulation skills, effective information gathering is important in completing these assignments. To address this component of the problem, we formalize the information-gathering process in a fully cooperative setting as an underexplored multi-agent multi-task Embodied Question Answering (MM-EQA) problem, which is a novel extension of canonical Embodied Question Answering (EQA), where effective communication is crucial for coordinating efforts without redundancy. To address this problem, we propose CommCP, a novel LLM-based decentralized communication framework designed for MM-EQA. Our framework employs conformal prediction to calibrate the generated messages, thereby minimizing receiver distractions and enhancing communication reliability. To evaluate our framework, we introduce an MM-EQA benchmark featuring diverse, photo-realistic household scenarios with embodied questions. Experimental results demonstrate that CommCP significantly enhances the task success rate and exploration efficiency over baselines.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06039v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SwimBird: Eliciting Switchable Reasoning Mode in Hybrid Autoregressive MLLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06040</link><description>arXiv:2602.06040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in multimodal perception and reasoning by bridging vision and language. However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as "visual thoughts" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06040v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Camera Pose from Perspective Descriptions for Spatial Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06041</link><description>arXiv:2602.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-image spatial reasoning remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions. We also include human-annotated viewpoint descriptions in the test split to evaluate generalization to human language. CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and predicts target poses from natural-language viewpoint descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20{\deg} and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold. This direct grounding avoids expensive test-time search-and-match, reducing inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example and enabling fast, interactive use in real-world scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pseudo-Invertible Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06042</link><description>arXiv:2602.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) serves as the fundamental solution for linear systems. In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of PInv to the nonlinear regime in general and to neural networks in particular. We introduce Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN), a class of architectures explicitly designed to admit a tractable non-linear PInv. The proposed non-linear PInv and its implementation in SPNN satisfy fundamental geometric properties. One such property is null-space projection or "Back-Projection", $x' = x + A^\dagger(y-Ax)$, which moves a sample $x$ to its closest consistent state $x'$ satisfying $Ax=y$. We formalize Non-Linear Back-Projection (NLBP), a method that guarantees the same consistency constraint for non-linear mappings $f(x)=y$ via our defined PInv. We leverage SPNNs to expand the scope of zero-shot inverse problems. Diffusion-based null-space projection has revolutionized zero-shot solving for linear inverse problems by exploiting closed-form back-projection. We extend this method to non-linear degradations. Here, "degradation" is broadly generalized to include any non-linear loss of information, spanning from optical distortions to semantic abstractions like classification. This approach enables zero-shot inversion of complex degradations and allows precise semantic control over generative outputs without retraining the diffusion prior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06042v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Shared LoRA Subspaces for almost Strict Continual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06043</link><description>arXiv:2602.06043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06043v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cold Start Problem: An Experimental Study of Knowledge Tracing Models with New Students</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21517</link><description>arXiv:2505.21517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: KnowledgeTracing (KT) involves predicting students' knowledge states based on their interactions with Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). A key challenge is the cold start problem, accurately predicting knowledge for new students with minimal interaction data. Unlike prior work, which typically trains KT models on initial interactions of all students and tests on their subsequent interactions, our approach trains models solely using historical data from past students, evaluating their performance exclusively on entirely new students. We investigate cold start effects across three KT models: Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), Dynamic Key-Value Memory Networks (DKVMN), and Self-Attentive Knowledge Tracing (SAKT), using ASSISTments 2009, 2015, and 2017 datasets. Results indicate all models initially struggle under cold start conditions but progressively improve with more interactions; SAKT shows higher initial accuracy yet still faces limitations. These findings highlight the need for KT models that effectively generalize to new learners, emphasizing the importance of developing models robust in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.21517v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A General-Purpose Diversified 2D Seismic Image Dataset from NAMSS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04890</link><description>arXiv:2602.04890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Unicamp-NAMSS dataset, a large, diverse, and geographically distributed collection of migrated 2D seismic sections designed to support modern machine learning research in geophysics. We constructed the dataset from the National Archive of Marine Seismic Surveys (NAMSS), which contains decades of publicly available marine seismic data acquired across multiple regions, acquisition conditions, and geological settings. After a comprehensive collection and filtering process, we obtained 2588 cleaned and standardized seismic sections from 122 survey areas, covering a wide range of vertical and horizontal sampling characteristics. To ensure reliable experimentation, we balanced the dataset so that no survey dominates the distribution, and partitioned it into non-overlapping macro-regions for training, validation, and testing. This region-disjoint split allows robust evaluation of generalization to unseen geological and acquisition conditions.
  We validated the dataset through quantitative and embedding-space analyses using both convolutional and transformer-based models. These analyses showed that Unicamp-NAMSS exhibits substantial variability within and across regions, while maintaining coherent structure across acquisition macro-region and survey types. Comparisons with widely used interpretation datasets (Parihaka and F3 Block) further demonstrated that Unicamp-NAMSS covers a broader portion of the seismic appearance space, making it a strong candidate for machine learning model pretraining. The dataset, therefore, provides a valuable resource for machine learning tasks, including self-supervised representation learning, transfer learning, benchmarking supervised tasks such as super-resolution or attribute prediction, and studying domain adaptation in seismic interpretation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04890v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Independent Genes: Learning Module-Inductive Representations for Gene Perturbation Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04901</link><description>arXiv:2602.04901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting transcriptional responses to genetic perturbations is a central problem in functional genomics. In practice, perturbation responses are rarely gene-independent but instead manifest as coordinated, program-level transcriptional changes among functionally related genes. However, most existing methods do not explicitly model such coordination, due to gene-wise modeling paradigms and reliance on static biological priors that cannot capture dynamic program reorganization. To address these limitations, we propose scBIG, a module-inductive perturbation prediction framework that explicitly models coordinated gene programs. scBIG induces coherent gene programs from data via Gene-Relation Clustering, captures inter-program interactions through a Gene-Cluster-Aware Encoder, and preserves modular coordination using structure-aware alignment objectives. These structured representations are then modeled using conditional flow matching to enable flexible and generalizable perturbation prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple single-cell perturbation benchmarks show that scBIG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly on unseen and combinatorial perturbation settings, achieving an average improvement of 6.7% over the strongest baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04901v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AFD-INSTRUCTION: A Comprehensive Antibody Instruction Dataset with Functional Annotations for LLM-Based Understanding and Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04916</link><description>arXiv:2602.04916v1 Announce Type: cross

To address this challenge, we present AFD-Instruction, the first large-scale instruction dataset with functional annotations tailored to antibodies. This dataset encompasses two key components: antibody understanding, which infers functional attributes directly from sequences, and antibody design, which enables de novo sequence generation under functional constraints. These components provide explicit sequence-function alignment and support antibody design guided by natural language instructions. Extensive instruction-tuning experiments on general-purpose LLMs demonstrate that AFD-Instruction consistently improves performance across diverse antibody-related tasks. By linking antibody sequences with textual descriptions of function, AFD-Instruction establishes a new foundation for advancing antibody modeling and accelerating therapeutic discovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04916v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph--Theoretic Analysis of Phase Optimization Complexity in Variational Wave Functions for Heisenberg Antiferromagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04943</link><description>arXiv:2602.04943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smart Diagnosis and Early Intervention in PCOS: A Deep Learning Approach to Women's Reproductive Health</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04944</link><description>arXiv:2602.04944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a widespread disorder in women of reproductive age, characterized by a hormonal imbalance, irregular periods, and multiple ovarian cysts. Infertility, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risks are long-term complications that make early detection essential. In this paper, we design a powerful framework based on transfer learning utilizing DenseNet201 and ResNet50 for classifying ovarian ultrasound images. The model was trained on an online dataset containing 3856 ultrasound images of cyst-infected and non-infected patients. Each ultrasound frame was resized to 224x224 pixels and encoded with precise pathological indicators. The MixUp and CutMix augmentation strategies were used to improve generalization, yielding a peak validation accuracy of 99.80% by Densenet201 and a validation loss of 0.617 with alpha values of 0.25 and 0.4, respectively. We evaluated the model's interpretability using leading Explainable AI (XAI) approaches such as SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME, reasoning with and presenting explicit visual reasons for the model's behaviors, therefore increasing the model's transparency. This study proposes an automated system for medical picture diagnosis that may be used effectively and confidently in clinical practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04944v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Instance-optimal high-precision shadow tomography with few-copy measurements: A metrological approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04952</link><description>arXiv:2602.04952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of shadow tomography in the high-precision regime under realistic measurement constraints. Given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$ and a known set of observables $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$, the goal is to estimate expectation values $\{\mathrm{tr}(O_i\rho)\}_{i=1}^m$ to accuracy $\epsilon$ in $L_p$-norm, using possibly adaptive measurements that act on $O(\mathrm{polylog}(d))$ number of copies of $\rho$ at a time. We focus on the regime where $\epsilon$ is below an instance-dependent threshold.
  Our main contribution is an instance-optimal characterization of the sample complexity as $\tilde{\Theta}(\Gamma_p/\epsilon^2)$, where $\Gamma_p$ is a function of $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$ defined via an optimization formula involving the inverse Fisher information matrix. Previously, tight bounds were known only in special cases, e.g. Pauli shadow tomography with $L_\infty$-norm error. Concretely, we first analyze a simpler oblivious variant where the goal is to estimate an observable of the form $\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i O_i$ with $\|\alpha\|_q = 1$ (where $q$ is dual to $p$) revealed after the measurement. For single-copy measurements, we obtain a sample complexity of $\Theta(\Gamma^{\mathrm{ob}}_p/\epsilon^2)$. We then show $\tilde{\Theta}(\Gamma_p/\epsilon^2)$ is necessary and sufficient for the original problem, with the lower bound applying to unbiased, bounded estimators. Our upper bounds rely on a two-step algorithm combining coarse tomography with local estimation. Notably, $\Gamma^{\mathrm{ob}}_\infty = \Gamma_\infty$. In both cases, allowing $c$-copy measurements improves the sample complexity by at most $\Omega(1/c)$.
  Our results establish a quantitative correspondence between quantum learning and metrology, unifying asymptotic metrological limits with finite-sample learning guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04952v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI-Based Detection of In-Treatment Changes from Prostate MR-Linac Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04983</link><description>arXiv:2602.04983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To investigate whether routinely acquired longitudinal MR-Linac images can be leveraged to characterize treatment-induced changes during radiotherapy, particularly subtle inter-fraction changes over short intervals (average of 2 days). Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included a series of 0.35T MR-Linac images from 761 patients. An artificial intelligence (deep learning) model was used to characterize treatment-induced changes by predicting the temporal order of paired images. The model was first trained with the images from the first and the last fractions (F1-FL), then with all pairs (All-pairs). Model performance was assessed using quantitative metrics (accuracy and AUC), compared to a radiologist's performance, and qualitative analyses - the saliency map evaluation to investigate affected anatomical regions. Input ablation experiments were performed to identify the anatomical regions altered by radiotherapy. The radiologist conducted an additional task on partial images reconstructed by saliency map regions, reporting observations as well. Quantitative image analysis was conducted to investigate the results from the model and the radiologist. Results: The F1-FL model yielded near-perfect performance (AUC of 0.99), significantly outperforming the radiologist. The All-pairs model yielded an AUC of 0.97. This performance reflects therapy-induced changes, supported by the performance correlation to fraction intervals, ablation tests and expert's interpretation. Primary regions driving the predictions were prostate, bladder, and pubic symphysis. Conclusion: The model accurately predicts temporal order of MR-Linac fractions and detects radiation-induced changes over one or a few days, including prostate and adjacent organ alterations confirmed by experts. This underscores MR-Linac's potential for advanced image analysis beyond image guidance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04983v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Banach Control Barrier Functions for Large-Scale Swarm Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05011</link><description>arXiv:2602.05011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the safe control of very large multi-agent systems via a generalized framework that employs so-called Banach Control Barrier Functions (B-CBFs). Modeling a large swarm as probability distribution over a spatial domain, we show how B-CBFs can be used to appropriately capture a variety of macroscopic constraints that can integrate with large-scale swarm objectives. Leveraging this framework, we define stable and filtered gradient flows for large swarms, paying special attention to optimal transport algorithms. Further, we show how to derive agent-level, microscopical algorithms that are consistent with macroscopic counterparts in the large-scale limit. We then identify conditions for which a group of agents can compute a distributed solution that only requires local information from other agents within a communication range. Finally, we showcase the theoretical results over swarm systems in the simulations section.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05011v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QuantumGS: Quantum Encoding Framework for Gaussian Splatting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05047</link><description>arXiv:2602.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled real-time rendering of complex scenes. However, standard 3DGS relies on spherical harmonics, which often struggle to accurately capture high-frequency view-dependent effects such as sharp reflections and transparency. While hybrid approaches like Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) mitigate this limitation using classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they remain limited by the expressivity of classical networks in low-parameter regimes. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. We propose a unique encoding strategy that maps the viewing direction directly onto the Bloch sphere, leveraging the natural geometry of qubits to represent 3D directional data. By replacing classical color-modulating networks with quantum circuits generated via a hypernetwork or conditioning mechanism, we achieve higher expressivity and better generalization.

Abstract: Atmospheric blocking events drive persistent weather extremes in midlatitudes, but isolating the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) from chaotic internal atmospheric variability on these events remains a challenge. We address this challenge using century-long (1900-2010), large-ensemble simulations with two computationally efficient deep-learning general circulation models. We find these models skillfully reproduce the observed blocking climatology, matching or exceeding the performance of a traditional high-resolution model and representative CMIP6 models. Averaging the large ensembles filters internal atmospheric noise to isolate the SST-forced component of blocking variability, yielding substantially higher correlations with reanalysis than for individual ensemble members. We identify robust teleconnections linking Greenland blocking frequency to North Atlantic SST and El Ni\~no-like patterns. Furthermore, SST-forced trends in blocking frequency show a consistent decline in winter over Greenland, and an increase over Europe. These results demonstrate that SST variability exerts a significant and physically interpretable influence on blocking frequency and establishes large ensembles from deep learning models as a powerful tool for separating forced SST signals from internal noise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05083v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Path Sampling for Rare Events Boosted by Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05167</link><description>arXiv:2602.05167v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: We derive finite-particle rates for the regularized Stein variational gradient descent (R-SVGD) algorithm introduced by He et al. (2024) that corrects the constant-order bias of the SVGD by applying a resolvent-type preconditioner to the kernelized Wasserstein gradient. For the resulting interacting $N$-particle system, we establish explicit non-asymptotic bounds for time-averaged (annealed) empirical measures, illustrating convergence in the \emph{true} (non-kernelized) Fisher information and, under a $\mathrm{W}_1\mathrm{I}$ condition on the target, corresponding $\mathrm{W}_1$ convergence for a large class of smooth kernels. Our analysis covers both continuous- and discrete-time dynamics and yields principled tuning rules for the regularization parameter, step size, and averaging horizon that quantify the trade-off between approximating the Wasserstein gradient flow and controlling finite-particle estimation error.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05172v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Total Variation Rates for Riemannian Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05174</link><description>arXiv:2602.05174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Riemannian flow matching (RFM) extends flow-based generative modeling to data supported on manifolds by learning a time-dependent tangent vector field whose flow-ODE transports a simple base distribution to the data law. We develop a nonasymptotic Total Variation (TV) convergence analysis for RFM samplers that use a learned vector field together with Euler discretization on manifolds. Our key technical ingredient is a differential inequality governing the evolution of TV between two manifold ODE flows, which expresses the time-derivative of TV through the divergence of the vector-field mismatch and the score of the reference flow; controlling these terms requires establishing new bounds that explicitly account for parallel transport and curvature. Under smoothness assumptions on the population flow-matching field and either uniform (compact manifolds) or mean-square (Hadamard manifolds) approximation guarantees for the learned field, we obtain explicit bounds of the form $\mathrm{TV}\le C_{\mathrm{Lip}}\,h + C_{\varepsilon}\,\varepsilon$ (with an additional higher-order $\varepsilon^2$ term on compact manifolds), cleanly separating numerical discretization and learning errors. Here, $h$ is the step-size and $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy. Instantiations yield \emph{explicit} polynomial iteration complexities on the hypersphere $S^d$, and on the SPD$(n)$ manifolds under mild moment conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05174v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Sequential to Parallel: Reformulating Dynamic Programming as GPU Kernels for Large-Scale Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05179</link><description>arXiv:2602.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major bottleneck in scenario-based Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for stochastic programming (SP) is the cost of solving an exact second-stage problem for every scenario, especially when each scenario contains an NP-hard combinatorial structure. This has led much of the SP literature to restrict the second stage to linear or simplified models. We develop a GPU-based framework that makes full-fidelity integer second-stage models tractable at scale. The key innovation is a set of hardware-aware, scenario-batched GPU kernels that expose parallelism across scenarios, dynamic-programming (DP) layers, and route or action options, enabling Bellman updates to be executed in a single pass over more than 1,000,000 realizations. We evaluate the approach in two representative SP settings: a vectorized split operator for stochastic vehicle routing and a DP for inventory reinsertion. Implementation scales nearly linearly in the number of scenarios and achieves a one-two to four-five orders of magnitude speedup, allowing far larger scenario sets and reliably stronger first-stage decisions. The computational leverage directly improves decision quality: much larger scenario sets and many more first-stage candidates can be evaluated within fixed time budgets, consistently yielding stronger SAA solutions. Our results show that full-fidelity integer second-stage models are tractable at scales previously considered impossible, providing a practical path to large-scale, realistic stochastic discrete optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05179v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Worst-Case Guarantees with Scale-Aware Interpretability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05184</link><description>arXiv:2602.05184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks organize information according to the hierarchical, multi-scale structure of natural data. Methods to interpret model internals should be similarly scale-aware, explicitly tracking how features compose across resolutions and guaranteeing bounds on the influence of fine-grained structure that is discarded as irrelevant noise. We posit that the renormalisation framework from physics can meet this need by offering technical tools that can overcome limitations of current methods. Moreover, relevant work from adjacent fields has now matured to a point where scattered research threads can be synthesized into practical, theory-informed tools. To combine these threads in an AI safety context, we propose a unifying research agenda -- \emph{scale-aware interpretability} -- to develop formal machinery and interpretability tools that have robustness and faithfulness properties supported by statistical physics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05184v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARCHI-TTS: A flow-matching-based Text-to-Speech Model with Self-supervised Semantic Aligner and Accelerated Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05207</link><description>arXiv:2602.05207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although diffusion-based, non-autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) systems have demonstrated impressive zero-shot synthesis capabilities, their efficacy is still hindered by two key challenges: the difficulty of text-speech alignment modeling and the high computational overhead of the iterative denoising process. To address these limitations, we propose ARCHI-TTS that features a dedicated semantic aligner to ensure robust temporal and semantic consistency between text and audio. To overcome high computational inference costs, ARCHI-TTS employs an efficient inference strategy that reuses encoder features across denoising steps, drastically accelerating synthesis without performance degradation. An auxiliary CTC loss applied to the condition encoder further enhances the semantic understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that ARCHI-TTS achieves a WER of 1.98% on LibriSpeech-PC test-clean, and 1.47%/1.42% on SeedTTS test-en/test-zh with a high inference efficiency, consistently outperforming recent state-of-the-art TTS systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensembling for Interpretable Retinopathy of Prematurity Screening via Active Query and Vascular Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05208</link><description>arXiv:2602.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is among the major causes of preventable childhood blindness. Automated screening remains challenging, primarily due to limited data availability and the complex condition involving both structural staging and microvascular abnormalities. Current deep learning models depend heavily on large private datasets and passive multimodal fusion, which commonly fail to generalize on small, imbalanced public cohorts. We thus propose the Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensemble Model (CAA Ensemble) that simulates clinical reasoning through two specialized streams. First, the Multi-Scale Active Query Network (MS-AQNet) serves as a structure specialist, utilizing clinical contexts as dynamic query vectors to spatially control visual feature extraction for localization of the fibrovascular ridge. Secondly, VascuMIL encodes Vascular Topology Maps (VMAP) within a gated Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) network to precisely identify vascular tortuosity. A synergistic meta-learner ensembles these orthogonal signals to resolve diagnostic discordance across multiple objectives. Tested on a highly imbalanced cohort of 188 infants (6,004 images), the framework attained State-of-the-Art performance on two distinct clinical tasks: achieving a Macro F1-Score of 0.93 for Broad ROP staging and an AUC of 0.996 for Plus Disease detection. Crucially, the system features `Glass Box' transparency through counterfactual attention heatmaps and vascular threat maps, proving that clinical metadata dictates the model's visual search. Additionally, this study demonstrates that architectural inductive bias can serve as an effective bridge for the medical AI data gap.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05208v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Radon--Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Interacting-Particle Sampling in High Dimensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05227</link><description>arXiv:2602.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient flows of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, such as the Fokker--Planck equation and Stein Variational Gradient Descent, evolve a distribution toward a target density known only up to a normalizing constant. We introduce new gradient flows of the KL divergence with a remarkable combination of properties: they admit accurate interacting-particle approximations in high dimensions, and the per-step cost scales linearly in both the number of particles and the dimension. These gradient flows are based on new transportation-based Riemannian geometries on the space of probability measures: the Radon--Wasserstein geometry and the related Regularized Radon--Wasserstein (RRW) geometry. We define these geometries using the Radon transform so that the gradient-flow velocities depend only on one-dimensional projections. This yields interacting-particle-based algorithms whose per-step cost follows from efficient Fast Fourier Transform-based evaluation of the required 1D convolutions. We additionally provide numerical experiments that study the performance of the proposed algorithms and compare convergence behavior and quantization. Finally, we prove some theoretical results including well-posedness of the flows and long-time convergence guarantees for the RRW flow.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05227v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Logarithmic-time Schedules for Scaling Language Models with Momentum</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05298</link><description>arXiv:2602.05298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In practice, the hyperparameters $(\beta_1, \beta_2)$ and weight-decay $\lambda$ in AdamW are typically kept at fixed values. Is there any reason to do otherwise? We show that for large-scale language model training, the answer is yes: by exploiting the power-law structure of language data, one can design time-varying schedules for $(\beta_1, \beta_2, \lambda)$ that deliver substantial performance gains.
  We study logarithmic-time scheduling, in which the optimizer's gradient memory horizon grows with training time. Although naive variants of this are unstable, we show that suitable damping mechanisms restore stability while preserving the benefits of longer memory. Based on this, we present ADANA, an AdamW-like optimizer that couples log-time schedules with explicit damping to balance stability and performance. We empirically evaluate ADANA across transformer scalings (45M to 2.6B parameters), comparing against AdamW, Muon, and AdEMAMix.
  When properly tuned, ADANA achieves up to 40% compute efficiency relative to a tuned AdamW, with gains that persist--and even improve--as model scale increases. We further show that similar benefits arise when applying logarithmic-time scheduling to AdEMAMix, and that logarithmic-time weight-decay alone can yield significant improvements. Finally, we present variants of ADANA that mitigate potential failure modes and improve robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05298v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Boxplots and quartile plots for grouped and periodic angular data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05335</link><description>arXiv:2602.05335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angular observations, or observations lying on the unit circle, arise in many disciplines and require special care in their description, analysis, interpretation and visualization. We provide methods to construct concentric circular boxplot displays of distributions of groups of angular data. The use of concentric boxplots brings challenges of visual perception, so we set the boxwidths to be inversely proportional to the square root of their distance from the centre. A perception survey supports this scaled boxwidth choice. For a large number of groups, we propose circular quartile plots. A three-dimensional toroidal display is also implemented for periodic angular distributions. We illustrate our methods on datasets in (1) psychology, to display motor resonance under different conditions, (2) genomics, to understand the distribution of peak phases for ancillary clock genes, and (3) meteorology and wind turbine power generation, to study the changing and periodic distribution of wind direction over the course of a year.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05335v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decision-Focused Sequential Experimental Design: A Directional Uncertainty-Guided Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05340</link><description>arXiv:2602.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the sequential experimental design problem in the predict-then-optimize paradigm. In this paradigm, the outputs of the prediction model are used as coefficient vectors in a downstream linear optimization problem. Traditional sequential experimental design aims to control the input variables (features) so that the improvement in prediction accuracy from each experimental outcome (label) is maximized. However, in the predict-then-optimize setting, performance is ultimately evaluated based on the decision loss induced by the downstream optimization, rather than by prediction error. This mismatch between prediction accuracy and decision loss renders traditional decision-blind designs inefficient. To address this issue, we propose a directional-based metric to quantify predictive uncertainty. This metric does not require solving an optimization oracle and is therefore computationally tractable. We show that the resulting sequential design criterion enjoys strong consistency and convergence guarantees. Under a broad class of distributions, we demonstrate that our directional uncertainty-based design attains an earlier stopping time than decision-blind designs. This advantage is further supported by real-world experiments on an LLM job allocation problem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05340v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distributed Model Predictive Control for Energy and Comfort Optimization in Large Buildings Using Piecewise Affine Approximation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05376</link><description>arXiv:2602.05376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of large buildings encounters challenges in computational efficiency due to their size and nonlinear components. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Piecewise Affine (PWA)-based distributed scheme for Model Predictive Control (MPC) that optimizes energy and comfort through PWA-based quadratic programming. We utilize the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for effective decomposition and apply the PWA technique to handle the nonlinear components. To solve the resulting large-scale nonconvex problems, the paper introduces a convex ADMM algorithm that transforms the nonconvex problem into a series of smaller convex problems, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the convex ADMM algorithm converges to a local optimum of the original problem. A case study involving 36 zones validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our proposed method reduces execution time by 86\% compared to the centralized version.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05376v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Variance Reduction Based Experience Replay for Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05379</link><description>arXiv:2602.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for complex stochastic systems requires leveraging historical data collected in previous iterations to accelerate policy optimization. Classical experience replay treats all past observations uniformly and fails to account for their varying contributions to learning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Variance Reduction Experience Replay (VRER), a principled framework that selectively reuses informative samples to reduce variance in policy gradient estimation. VRER is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing policy optimization methods, forming the basis of our sample-efficient off-policy algorithm, Policy Gradient with VRER (PG-VRER). Motivated by the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis of experience replay, we develop a novel framework that explicitly captures dependencies introduced by Markovian dynamics and behavior-policy interactions. Using this framework, we establish finite-time convergence guarantees for PG-VRER and reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off: reusing older experience increases bias but simultaneously reduces gradient variance. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that VRER consistently accelerates policy learning and improves performance over state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05379v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal Bayesian Stopping for Efficient Inference of Consistent LLM Answers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05395</link><description>arXiv:2602.05395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple strategy for improving LLM accuracy, especially in math and reasoning problems, is to sample multiple responses and submit the answer most consistently reached. In this paper we leverage Bayesian prior information to save on sampling costs, stopping once sufficient consistency is reached. Although the exact posterior is computationally intractable, we further introduce an efficient "L-aggregated" stopping policy that tracks only the L-1 most frequent answer counts. Theoretically, we prove that L=3 is all you need: this coarse approximation is sufficient to achieve asymptotic optimality, and strictly dominates prior-free baselines, while having a fast posterior computation. Empirically, this identifies the most consistent (i.e., mode) LLM answer using fewer samples, and can achieve similar answer accuracy while cutting the number of LLM calls (i.e., saving on LLM inference costs) by up to 50%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05395v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wave-Trainer-Fit: Neural Vocoder with Trainable Prior and Fixed-Point Iteration towards High-Quality Speech Generation from SSL features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05443</link><description>arXiv:2602.05443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose WaveTrainerFit, a neural vocoder that performs high-quality waveform generation from data-driven features such as SSL features. WaveTrainerFit builds upon the WaveFit vocoder, which integrates diffusion model and generative adversarial network. Furthermore, the proposed method incorporates the following key improvements: 1. By introducing trainable priors, the inference process starts from noise close to the target speech instead of Gaussian noise. 2. Reference-aware gain adjustment is performed by imposing constraints on the trainable prior to matching the speech energy. These improvements are expected to reduce the complexity of waveform modeling from data-driven features, enabling high-quality waveform generation with fewer inference steps. Through experiments, we showed that WaveTrainerFit can generate highly natural waveforms with improved speaker similarity from data-driven features, while requiring fewer iterations than WaveFit. Moreover, we showed that the proposed method works robustly with respect to the depth at which SSL features are extracted.

Abstract: Liver tumour ablation presents a significant clinical challenge: whilst tumours are clearly visible on pre-operative MRI, they are often effectively invisible on intra-operative CT due to minimal contrast between pathological and healthy tissue. This work investigates the feasibility of cross-modality weak supervision for scenarios where pathology is visible in one modality (MRI) but absent in another (CT). We present a hybrid registration-segmentation framework that combines MSCGUNet for inter-modal image registration with a UNet-based segmentation module, enabling registration-assisted pseudo-label generation for CT images. Our evaluation on the CHAOS dataset demonstrates that the pipeline can successfully register and segment healthy liver anatomy, achieving a Dice score of 0.72. However, when applied to clinical data containing tumours, performance degrades substantially (Dice score of 0.16), revealing the fundamental limitations of current registration methods when the target pathology lacks corresponding visual features in the target modality. We analyse the "domain gap" and "feature absence" problems, demonstrating that whilst spatial propagation of labels via registration is feasible for visible structures, segmenting truly invisible pathology remains an open challenge. Our findings highlight that registration-based label transfer cannot compensate for the absence of discriminative features in the target modality, providing important insights for future research in cross-modality medical image analysis.

Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental classical computing operation whose efficiency becomes a major challenge at scale, especially for machine learning applications. Quantum computing, with its inherent parallelism and exponential storage capacity, offers a potential solution to these limitations. This work presents a quantum kernel-based matrix multiplication algorithm (QKMM) that achieves an asymptotically optimal computational complexity of $ O(N^2 \log_2 N) $, outperforming the classical optimal complexity of $ O(N^{2.371552}) $, where $N$ denotes the matrix dimension. Through noiseless and noisy quantum simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only exhibits superior theoretical efficiency but also shows practical advantages in runtime performance and stability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05541v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A term-by-term variational multiscale method with dynamic subscales for incompressible turbulent aerodynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05563</link><description>arXiv:2602.05563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational multiscale (VMS) methods offer a robust framework for handling under-resolved flow scales without resorting to problem-specific turbulence models. Here, we propose and assess a dynamic, term-by-term VMS stabilized formulation for simulating incompressible flows from laminar to turbulent regimes. The method is embedded in an incremental pressure-correction fractional-step framework and employs a minimal set of stabilization terms, yielding a unified discretization that (i) allows equal-order velocity--pressure interpolation and (ii) provides robust control of convection-dominated dynamics in complex three-dimensional settings. Orthogonal projections are a key ingredient and ensure that the non-residual, term-by-term structure induces dissipation through dynamic subscales suitable for turbulent simulations. The methodology is validated on large-scale external-aerodynamics configurations, including the Ahmed body at Re $ = 7.68\times 10^{5}$ for multiple slant angles, using unstructured tetrahedral meshes ranging from 3 to 40 million elements. Applicability is further demonstrated on a realistic Formula~1 configuration at $U_\infty=56~\mathrm{m/s}$ (201.6~km/h), corresponding to Re $ \approx 10^{6}$. The results show that the proposed stabilized pressure-segregated formulation remains robust at scale and captures key separated-flow features and coherent wake organization. Pointwise velocity and pressure spectra provide an a posteriori consistency indicator, exhibiting finite frequency ranges compatible with inertial-subrange reference slopes in the resolved band and supporting dissipation control in under-resolved regimes within a unified stabilized finite element framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05563v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Algorithms for Robust Markov Decision Processes with $s$-Rectangular Ambiguity Sets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05591</link><description>arXiv:2602.05591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust Markov decision processes (MDPs) have attracted significant interest due to their ability to protect MDPs from poor out-of-sample performance in the presence of ambiguity. In contrast to classical MDPs, which account for stochasticity by modeling the dynamics through a stochastic process with a known transition kernel, a robust MDP additionally accounts for ambiguity by optimizing against the most adverse transition kernel from an ambiguity set constructed via historical data. In this paper, we develop a unified solution framework for a broad class of robust MDPs with $s$-rectangular ambiguity sets, where the most adverse transition probabilities are considered independently for each state. Using our algorithms, we show that $s$-rectangular robust MDPs with $1$- and $2$-norm as well as $\phi$-divergence ambiguity sets can be solved several orders of magnitude faster than with state-of-the-art commercial solvers, and often only a logarithmic factor slower than classical MDPs. We demonstrate the favorable scaling properties of our algorithms on a range of synthetically generated as well as standard benchmark instances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05591v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive controllable architecture of analog Ising machine</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05595</link><description>arXiv:2602.05595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a quantum-inspired, non-traditional analog solver architecture, the analog Ising machine (AIM) has emerged as a distinctive computational paradigm to address the rapidly growing demand for computational power. However, the mathematical understanding of its principles, as well as the optimization of its solution speed and accuracy, remain unclear. In this work, we for the first time systematically discuss multiple implementations of AIM and establish a unified mathematical formulation. On this basis, by treating the binarization constraint of AIM (such as injection locking) as a Lagrange multiplier in optimization theory and combining it with a Lyapunov analysis from dynamical systems theory, an analytical framework for evaluating solution speed and accuracy is constructed, and further demonstrate that conventional AIMs possess a theoretical performance upper bound. Subsequently, by elevating the binarization constraint to a control variable, we propose the controllable analog Ising machine (CAIM), which integrates control Lyapunov functions and momentum-based optimization algorithms to realize adaptive sampling-feedback control, thereby surpassing the performance limits of conventional AIMs. In a proof-of-concept CAIM demonstration implemented using an FPGA-controlled LC-oscillator Ising machine, CAIM achieves a twofold speedup and a 7\% improvement in accuracy over AIM on a 50-node all-to-all weighted MaxCut problem, validating both the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed theoretical framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05595v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Broken neural scaling laws in materials science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05702</link><description>arXiv:2602.05702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In materials science, data are scarce and expensive to generate, whether computationally or experimentally. Therefore, it is crucial to identify how model performance scales with dataset size and model capacity to distinguish between data- and model-limited regimes. Neural scaling laws provide a framework for quantifying this behavior and guide the design of materials datasets and machine learning architectures. Here, we investigate neural scaling laws for a paradigmatic materials science task: predicting the dielectric function of metals, a high-dimensional response that governs how solids interact with light. Using over 200,000 dielectric functions from high-throughput ab initio calculations, we study two multi-objective graph neural networks trained to predict the frequency-dependent complex interband dielectric function and the Drude frequency. We observe broken neural scaling laws with respect to dataset size, whereas scaling with the number of model parameters follows a simple power law that rapidly saturates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05702v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reciprocity Calibration of Dual-Antenna Repeaters via MMSE Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05724</link><description>arXiv:2602.05724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Bayesian reciprocity calibration method that consistently ensures uplink and downlink channel reciprocity in repeater-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed algorithm is formulated under the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion. Its Bayesian framework incorporates complete statistical knowledge of the signal model, noise, and prior distributions, enabling a coherent design that achieves both low computational complexity and high calibration accuracy. To further enhance phase alignment accuracy, which is critical for calibration tasks, we develop a von Mises denoiser that exploits the fact that the target parameters lie on the circle in the complex plane. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MMSE algorithm achieves substantially improved estimation accuracy compared with conventional deterministic non-linear least-squares (NLS) methods, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits remarkably fast convergence, making it well suited for practical implementation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05724v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Disc-Centric Contrastive Learning for Lumbar Spine Severity Grading</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05738</link><description>arXiv:2602.05738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines a disc-centric approach for automated severity grading of lumbar spinal stenosis from sagittal T2-weighted MRI. The method combines contrastive pretraining with disc-level fine-tuning, using a single anatomically localized region of interest per intervertebral disc. Contrastive learning is employed to help the model focus on meaningful disc features and reduce sensitivity to irrelevant differences in image appearance. The framework includes an auxiliary regression task for disc localization and applies weighted focal loss to address class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate a 78.1% balanced accuracy and a reduced severe-to-normal misclassification rate of 2.13% compared with supervised training from scratch. Detecting discs with moderate severity can still be challenging, but focusing on disc-level features provides a practical way to assess the lumbar spinal stenosis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05738v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast Rates for Nonstationary Weighted Risk Minimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05742</link><description>arXiv:2602.05742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weighted empirical risk minimization is a common approach to prediction under distribution drift. This article studies its out-of-sample prediction error under nonstationarity. We provide a general decomposition of the excess risk into a learning term and an error term associated with distribution drift, and prove oracle inequalities for the learning error under mixing conditions. The learning bound holds uniformly over arbitrary weight classes and accounts for the effective sample size induced by the weight vector, the complexity of the weight and hypothesis classes, and potential data dependence. We illustrate the applicability and sharpness of our results in (auto-) regression problems with linear models, basis approximations, and neural networks, recovering minimax-optimal rates (up to logarithmic factors) when specialized to unweighted and stationary settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05742v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PMT Waveform Simulation and Reconstruction with Conditional Diffusion Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05767</link><description>arXiv:2602.05767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely employed in particle and nuclear physics experiments. The accuracy of PMT waveform reconstruction directly impacts the detector's spatial and energy resolution. A key challenge arises when multiple photons arrive within a few nanoseconds, making it difficult to resolve individual photoelectrons (PEs). Although supervised deep learning methods have surpassed traditional methods in performance, their practical applicability is limited by the lack of ground-truth PE labels in real data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative weakly supervised waveform simulation and reconstruction approach based on a bidirectional conditional diffusion network framework. The method is fully data-driven and requires only raw waveforms and coarse estimates of PE information as input. It first employs a PE-conditioned diffusion model to simulate realistic waveforms from PE sequences, thereby learning the features of overlapping waveforms. Subsequently, these simulated waveforms are used to train a waveform-conditioned diffusion model to reconstruct the PE sequences from waveforms, reinforcing the learning of features of overlapping waveforms. Through iterative refinement between the two conditional diffusion processes, the model progressively improves reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 99% of the normalized PE-number resolution averaged over 1-5 p.e. and 80% of the timing resolution attained by fully supervised learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05767v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning False Discovery Rate Control via Model-Based Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05798</link><description>arXiv:2602.05798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in high-dimensional variable selection requires balancing rigorous error control with statistical power. Existing methods with provable guarantees are often overly conservative, creating a persistent gap between the realized false discovery proportion (FDP) and the target FDR level. We introduce a learning-augmented enhancement of the T-Rex Selector framework that narrows this gap. Our approach replaces the analytical FDP estimator with a neural network trained solely on diverse synthetic datasets, enabling a substantially tighter and more accurate approximation of the FDP. This refinement allows the procedure to operate much closer to the desired FDR level, thereby increasing discovery power while maintaining effective approximate control. Through extensive simulations and a challenging synthetic genome-wide association study (GWAS), we demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection of true variables compared to existing approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05798v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Non-Stationary Inventory Control with Lead Times</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05799</link><description>arXiv:2602.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-stationary single-item, periodic-review inventory control problems in which the demand distribution is unknown and may change over time. We analyze how demand non-stationarity affects learning performance across inventory models, including systems with demand backlogging or lost-sales, both with and without lead times. For each setting, we propose an adaptive online algorithm that optimizes over the class of base-stock policies and establish performance guarantees in terms of dynamic regret relative to the optimal base-stock policy at each time step. Our results reveal a sharp separation across inventory models. In backlogging systems and lost-sales models with zero lead time, we show that it is possible to adapt to demand changes without incurring additional performance loss in stationary environments, even without prior knowledge of the demand distributions or the number of demand shifts. In contrast, for lost-sales systems with positive lead times, we establish weaker guarantees that reflect fundamental limitations imposed by delayed replenishment in combination with censored feedback. Our algorithms leverage the convexity and one-sided feedback structure of inventory costs to enable counterfactual policy evaluation despite demand censoring. We complement the theoretical analysis with simulation results showing that our methods significantly outperform existing benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05799v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Quantum Message Complexity of Distributed Wake-Up with Advice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05801</link><description>arXiv:2602.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the distributed wake-up problem with advice, where nodes are equipped with initial knowledge about the network at large. After the adversary awakens a subset of nodes, an oracle computes a bit string (``the advice'') for each node, and the goal is to wake up all sleeping nodes efficiently. We present the first upper and lower bounds on the message complexity for wake-up in the quantum routing model, introduced by Dufoulon, Magniez, and Pandurangan (PODC 2025). In more detail, we give a distributed advising scheme that, given $\alpha$ bits of advice per node, wakes up all nodes with a message complexity of $O( \sqrt{\frac{n^3}{2^{\max\{\lfloor (\alpha-1)/2 \rfloor},0\}}}\cdot\log n )$ with high probability. Our result breaks the $\Omega( \frac{n^2}{2^\alpha} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $\Omega( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05801v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal scaling laws in learning hierarchical multi-index models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05846</link><description>arXiv:2602.05846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a sharp theory of scaling laws for two-layer neural networks trained on a class of hierarchical multi-index targets, in a genuinely representation-limited regime. We derive exact information-theoretic scaling laws for subspace recovery and prediction error, revealing how the hierarchical features of the target are sequentially learned through a cascade of phase transitions. We further show that these optimal rates are achieved by a simple, target-agnostic spectral estimator, which can be interpreted as the small learning-rate limit of gradient descent on the first-layer weights. Once an adapted representation is identified, the readout can be learned statistically optimally, using an efficient procedure. As a consequence, we provide a unified and rigorous explanation of scaling laws, plateau phenomena, and spectral structure in shallow neural networks trained on such hierarchical targets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05846v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Distribution-free two-sample testing with blurred total variation distance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05862</link><description>arXiv:2602.05862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-sample testing, where we aim to determine whether two distributions are equal or not equal based on samples from each one, is challenging if we cannot place assumptions on the properties of the two distributions. In particular, certifying equality of distributions, or even providing a tight upper bound on the total variation (TV) distance between the distributions, is impossible to achieve in a distribution-free regime. In this work, we examine the blurred TV distance, a relaxation of TV distance that enables us to perform inference without assumptions on the distributions. We provide theoretical guarantees for distribution-free upper and lower bounds on the blurred TV distance, and examine its properties in high dimensions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05862v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wedge Sampling: Efficient Tensor Completion with Nearly-Linear Sample Complexity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05869</link><description>arXiv:2602.05869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Wedge Sampling, a new non-adaptive sampling scheme for low-rank tensor completion. We study recovery of an order-$k$ low-rank tensor of dimension $n \times \cdots \times n$ from a subset of its entries. Unlike the standard uniform entry model (i.e., i.i.d. samples from $[n]^k$), wedge sampling allocates observations to structured length-two patterns (wedges) in an associated bipartite sampling graph. By directly promoting these length-two connections, the sampling design strengthens the spectral signal that underlies efficient initialization, in regimes where uniform sampling is too sparse to generate enough informative correlations.
  Our main result shows that this change in sampling paradigm enables polynomial-time algorithms to achieve both weak and exact recovery with nearly linear sample complexity in $n$. The approach is also plug-and-play: wedge-sampling-based spectral initialization can be combined with existing refinement procedures (e.g., spectral or gradient-based methods) using only an additional $\tilde{O}(n)$ uniformly sampled entries, substantially improving over the $\tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ sample complexity typically required under uniform entry sampling for efficient methods. Overall, our results suggest that the statistical-to-computational gap highlighted in Barak and Moitra (2022) is, to a large extent, a consequence of the uniform entry sampling model for tensor completion, and that alternative non-adaptive measurement designs that guarantee a strong initialization can overcome this barrier.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05869v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Universal approximation with signatures of non-geometric rough paths</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05898</link><description>arXiv:2602.05898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a universal approximation theorem for signatures of rough paths that are not necessarily weakly geometric. By extending the path with time and its rough path bracket terms, we prove that linear functionals of the signature of the resulting rough paths approximate continuous functionals on rough path spaces uniformly on compact sets. Moreover, we construct the signature of a path extended by its pathwise quadratic variation terms based on general pathwise stochastic integration \`a la F\"ollmer, in particular, allowing for pathwise It\^o, Stratonovich, and backward It\^o integration. In a probabilistic setting, we obtain a universal approximation result for linear functionals of the signature of continuous semimartingales extended by the quadratic variation terms, defined via stochastic It\^o integration. Numerical examples illustrate the use of signatures when the path is extended by time and quadratic variation in the context of model calibration and option pricing in mathematical finance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05898v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transformers Are Born Biased: Structural Inductive Biases at Random Initialization and Their Practical Consequences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05927</link><description>arXiv:2602.05927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers underpin modern large language models (LLMs) and are commonly assumed to be behaviorally unstructured at random initialization, with all meaningful preferences emerging only through large-scale training. We challenge this assumption by showing that randomly initialized transformers already exhibit strong and systematic structural biases. In particular, untrained models display extreme token preferences: across random input sequences, certain tokens are predicted with probabilities orders of magnitude larger.
  We provide a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon by dissecting the transformer architecture at initialization. We show that extreme token preference arises from a contraction of token representations along a random seed-dependent direction. This contraction is driven by two interacting forces: (i) asymmetric nonlinear activations in MLP sublayers induce global (inter-sequence) representation concentration, and (ii) self-attention further amplifies this effect through local (intra-sequence) aggregation. Together, these mechanisms align hidden representations along a direction determined solely by the random initialization, producing highly non-uniform next-token predictions.
  Beyond mechanistic insight, we demonstrate that these initialization-induced biases persist throughout training, forming a stable and intrinsic model identity. Leveraging this property, we introduce SeedPrint, a fingerprinting method that can reliably distinguish models that differ only in their random initialization, even after extensive training and under substantial distribution shift. Finally, we identify a fundamental positional discrepancy inherent to the attention mechanism's intra-sequence contraction that is causally linked to the attention-sink phenomenon. This discovery provides a principled explanation for the emergence of sinks and offers a pathway for their control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05927v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Normalization of ReLU Dual for Cut Generation in Stochastic Mixed-Integer Programs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05974</link><description>arXiv:2602.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) dual, an existing dual formulation for stochastic programs that reformulates non-anticipativity constraints using ReLU functions to generate tight, non-convex, and mixed-integer representable cuts. While this dual reformulation guarantees convergence with mixed-integer state variables, it admits multiple optimal solutions that can yield weak cuts. To address this issue, we propose normalizing the dual in the extended space to identify solutions that yield stronger cuts. We prove that the resulting normalized cuts are tight and Pareto-optimal in the original state space. We further compare normalization with existing regularization-based approaches for handling dual degeneracy and explain why normalization offers key advantages. In particular, we show that normalization can recover any cut obtained via regularization, whereas the converse does not hold. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods by consistently yielding stronger cuts and reducing solution times on harder instances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05974v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion Model's Generalization Can Be Characterized by Inductive Biases toward a Data-Dependent Ridge Manifold</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06021</link><description>arXiv:2602.06021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a diffusion model is not memorizing the training data set, how does it generalize exactly? A quantitative understanding of the distribution it generates would be beneficial to, for example, an assessment of the model's performance for downstream applications. We thus explicitly characterize what diffusion model generates, by proposing a log-density ridge manifold and quantifying how the generated data relate to this manifold as inference dynamics progresses. More precisely, inference undergoes a reach-align-slide process centered around the ridge manifold: trajectories first reach a neighborhood of the manifold, then align as being pushed toward or away from the manifold in normal directions, and finally slide along the manifold in tangent directions. Within the scope of this general behavior, different training errors will lead to different normal and tangent motions, which can be quantified, and these detailed motions characterize when inter-mode generations emerge. More detailed understanding of training dynamics will lead to more accurate quantification of the generation inductive bias, and an example of random feature model will be considered, for which we can explicitly illustrate how diffusion model's inductive biases originate as a composition of architectural bias and training accuracy, and how they evolve with the inference dynamics. Experiments on synthetic multimodal distributions and MNIST latent diffusion support the predicted directional effects, in both low- and high-dimensions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06021v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PASH at TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track: Generative Enhanced Model for Multi-stage Ranking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11245</link><description>arXiv:2205.11245v5 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has profoundly enhanced the fidelity of image generation, but it has raised concerns about copyright infringements. While prior methods have introduced adversarial perturbations to prevent style imitation, most are accompanied by the degradation of artworks' visual quality. Recognizing the importance of maintaining this, we introduce a visually improved protection method while preserving its protection capability. To this end, we devise a perceptual map to highlight areas sensitive to human eyes, guided by instance-aware refinement, which refines the protection intensity accordingly. We also introduce a difficulty-aware protection by predicting how difficult the artwork is to protect and dynamically adjusting the intensity based on this. Lastly, we integrate a perceptual constraints bank to further improve the imperceptibility. Results show that our method substantially elevates the quality of the protected image without compromising on protection efficacy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2403.19254v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Differential and Pointwise Control Approach to Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15617</link><description>arXiv:2404.15617v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous state-action spaces remains challenging in scientific computing due to poor sample efficiency and lack of pathwise physical consistency. We introduce Differential Reinforcement Learning (Differential RL), a novel framework that reformulates RL from a continuous-time control perspective via a differential dual formulation. This induces a Hamiltonian structure that embeds physics priors and ensures consistent trajectories without requiring explicit constraints. To implement Differential RL, we develop Differential Policy Optimization (dfPO), a pointwise, stage-wise algorithm that refines local movement operators along the trajectory for improved sample efficiency and dynamic alignment. We establish pointwise convergence guarantees, a property not available in standard RL, and derive a competitive theoretical regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(K^{5/6})$. Empirically, dfPO outperforms standard RL baselines on representative scientific computing tasks, including surface modeling, grid control, and molecular dynamics, under low-data and physics-constrained conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.15617v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Opportunistically Parallel Lambda Calculus</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11361</link><description>arXiv:2405.11361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scripting languages are widely used to compose external calls such as native libraries and network services. In such scripts, execution time is often dominated by waiting for these external calls, rendering traditional single-language optimizations ineffective. To address this, we propose a novel opportunistic evaluation strategy for scripting languages based on a core lambda calculus that automatically dispatches independent external calls in parallel and streams their results. We prove that our approach is confluent, ensuring that it preserves the programmer's original intent, and that it eventually executes every external call. We implement this approach in a scripting language called Opal. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of Opal, focusing on programs that invoke heavy external computation through the use of large language models (LLMs) and other APIs. Across five scripts, we compare to several state-of-the-art baselines and show that opportunistic evaluation improves total running time (up to $6.2\times$) and latency (up to $12.7\times$) compared to standard sequential Python, while performing very close (between $1.3\%$ and $18.5\%$ running time overhead) to hand-tuned manually optimized asynchronous Rust. For Tree-of-Thoughts, a prominent LLM reasoning approach, we achieve a $6.2\times$ performance improvement over the authors' own implementation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.11361v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] In-context Time Series Predictor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14982</link><description>arXiv:2405.14982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate in-context learning ability to perform various functions based solely on the provided context, without updating model parameters. To fully utilize the in-context capabilities in time series forecasting (TSF) problems, unlike previous Transformer-based or LLM-based time series forecasting methods, we reformulate "time series forecasting tasks" as input tokens by constructing a series of (lookback, future) pairs within the tokens. This method aligns more closely with the inherent in-context mechanisms, and is more parameter-efficient without the need of using pre-trained LLM parameters. Furthermore, it addresses issues such as overfitting in existing Transformer-based TSF models, consistently achieving better performance across full-data, few-shot, and zero-shot settings compared to previous architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.14982v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Policy Gradient-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Method for Time Series Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09643</link><description>arXiv:2406.09643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence architectures built upon recurrent neural networks have become a standard choice for multi-step-ahead time series prediction. In these models, the decoder produces future values conditioned on contextual inputs, typically either actual historical observations (ground truth) or previously generated predictions. During training, feeding ground-truth values helps stabilize learning but creates a mismatch between training and inference conditions, known as exposure bias, since such true values are inaccessible during real-world deployment. On the other hand, using the model's own outputs as inputs at test time often causes errors to compound rapidly across prediction steps. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a new training paradigm grounded in reinforcement learning: a policy gradient-based method to learn an adaptive input selection strategy for sequence-to-sequence prediction models. Auxiliary models first synthesize plausible input candidates for the decoder, and a trainable policy network optimized via policy gradients dynamically chooses the most beneficial inputs to maximize long-term prediction performance. Empirical evaluations on diverse time series datasets confirm that our approach enhances both accuracy and stability in multi-step forecasting compared to conventional methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.09643v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Use of AI-Robotic Systems for Scientific Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17835</link><description>arXiv:2406.17835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of developing theories and models and testing them with experiments is fundamental to the scientific method. Automating the entire scientific method then requires not only automation of the induction of theories from data, but also experimentation from design to implementation. This is the idea behind a robot scientist -- a coupled system of AI and laboratory robotics that has agency to test hypotheses with real-world experiments. In this chapter we explore some of the fundamentals of robot scientists in the philosophy of science. We also map the activities of a robot scientist to machine learning paradigms, and argue that the scientific method shares an analogy with active learning. We demonstrate these concepts using examples from previous robot scientists, and also from Genesis: a next generation robot scientist designed for research in systems biology, comprising a micro-fluidic system with 1000 computer-controlled micro-bioreactors and interpretable models based in controlled vocabularies and logic.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.17835v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Sands to Mansions: Towards Automated Cyberattack Emulation with Classical Planning and Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16928</link><description>arXiv:2407.16928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolving attacker capabilities demand realistic and continuously updated cyberattack emulation for threat-informed defense and security benchmarking. Towards automated attack emulation, this paper defines modular attack actions and a linking model to organize and chain heterogeneous attack tools into causality-preserving cyberattacks. Building on this foundation, we introduce Aurora: an automated cyberattack emulation system powered by symbolic planning and large language models (LLMs). Aurora crafts actionable, causality-preserving attack chains tailored to Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports and target environments, and automatically executes these emulations. Using Aurora, we generated an extensive cyberattack emulation dataset from 250 attack reports, 15 times larger than the leading expert-crafted dataset. Our evaluation shows that Aurora significantly outperforms existing methods in creating actionable, diverse, and realistic attack chains. We release the dataset and use it to evaluate three state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems, whose performance differed notably from results on older datasets, highlighting the need for up-to-date, automated attack emulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.16928v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CGRA4ML: A Hardware/Software Framework to Implement Neural Networks for Scientific Edge Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15561</link><description>arXiv:2408.15561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scientific community increasingly relies on machine learning (ML) for near-sensor processing, leveraging its strengths in tasks such as pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and real-time decision-making. These deployments demand accelerators that combine extremely high performance with programmability, ease of integration, and straightforward verification. We present cgra4ml, an open-source, modular framework that generates parameterizable CGRA accelerators in synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL, tailored to common ML compute patterns found in scientific applications. The framework supports seamless system integration through AXI-compliant interfaces and open-source DMA components, and it includes automatic firmware generation for programming the accelerator. A comprehensive verification suite and a runtime firmware stack further support deployment across diverse SoC platforms. cgra4ml provides a modular, full-stack infrastructure, including a Python API, SystemVerilog hardware, TCL toolflows, and a C runtime, which facilitates easy integration and experimentation, allowing scientists to focus on innovation rather than dealing with the intricacies of hardware design and optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of cgra4ml to implement common scientific edge neural networks using ASIC and FPGA design flows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.15561v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Alignment of Diffusion Models: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Future</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07253</link><description>arXiv:2409.07253v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading paradigm in generative modeling, excelling in various applications. Despite their success, these models often misalign with human intentions and generate results with undesired properties or even harmful content. Inspired by the success and popularity of alignment in tuning large language models, recent studies have investigated aligning diffusion models with human expectations and preferences. This work mainly reviews alignment of diffusion models, covering advancements in fundamentals of alignment, alignment techniques of diffusion models, preference benchmarks, and evaluation for diffusion models. Moreover, we discuss key perspectives on current challenges and promising future directions on solving the remaining challenges in alignment of diffusion models. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive review paper for researchers and engineers to comprehend, practice, and research alignment of diffusion models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.07253v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-View Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Information Retrieval Based Fault Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12519</link><description>arXiv:2409.12519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most studies focused on information retrieval-based techniques for fault localization, which built representations for bug reports and source code files and matched their semantic vectors through similarity measurement. However, such approaches often ignore some useful information that might help improve localization performance, such as 1) the interaction relationship between bug reports and source code files; 2) the similarity relationship between bug reports; and 3) the co-citation relationship between source code files. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Multi-View Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Information Retrieval Fault Localization (MACL-IRFL) to learn the above-mentioned relationships for software fault localization. Specifically, we first generate data augmentations from report-code interaction view, report-report similarity view and code-code co-citation view separately, and adopt graph neural network to aggregate the information of bug reports or source code files from the three views in the embedding process. Moreover, we perform contrastive learning across these views. Our design of contrastive learning task will force the bug report representations to encode information shared by report-report and report-code views,and the source code file representations shared by code-code and report-code views, thereby alleviating the noise from auxiliary information. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five open-source Java projects. The results show that our model can improve over the best baseline up to 28.93%, 25.57% and 20.35% on Accuracy@1, MAP and MRR, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.12519v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Image inpainting for corrupted images by using the semi-super resolution GAN</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12636</link><description>arXiv:2409.12636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image inpainting is a valuable technique for enhancing images that have been corrupted. The primary challenge in this research revolves around the extent of corruption in the input image that the deep learning model must restore. To address this challenge, we introduce a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for learning and replicating the missing pixels. Additionally, we have developed a distinct variant of the Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN), which we refer to as the Semi-SRGAN (SSRGAN). Furthermore, we leveraged three diverse datasets to assess the robustness and accuracy of our proposed model. Our training process involves varying levels of pixel corruption to attain optimal accuracy and generate high-quality images.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.12636v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MVGS: Multi-view Regulated Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02103</link><description>arXiv:2410.02103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works in volume rendering, \textit{e.g.} NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), significantly advance the rendering quality and efficiency with the help of the learned implicit neural radiance field or 3D Gaussians. Rendering on top of an explicit representation, the vanilla 3DGS and its variants deliver real-time efficiency by optimizing the parametric model with single-view supervision per iteration during training which is adopted from NeRF. Consequently, certain views are overfitted, leading to unsatisfying appearance in novel-view synthesis and imprecise 3D geometries. To solve aforementioned problems, we propose a new 3DGS optimization method embodying four key novel contributions: 1) We transform the conventional single-view training paradigm into a multi-view training strategy. With our proposed multi-view regulation, 3D Gaussian attributes are further optimized without overfitting certain training views. As a general solution, we improve the overall accuracy in a variety of scenarios and different Gaussian variants. 2) Inspired by the benefit introduced by additional views, we further propose a cross-intrinsic guidance scheme, leading to a coarse-to-fine training procedure concerning different resolutions. 3) Built on top of our multi-view regulated training, we further propose a cross-ray densification strategy, densifying more Gaussian kernels in the ray-intersect regions from a selection of views. 4) By further investigating the densification strategy, we found that the effect of densification should be enhanced when certain views are distinct dramatically. As a solution, we propose a novel multi-view augmented densification strategy, where 3D Gaussians are encouraged to get densified to a sufficient number accordingly, resulting in improved reconstruction accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.02103v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WAVE: Weighted Autoregressive Varying Gate for Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03159</link><description>arXiv:2410.03159v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Weighted Autoregressive Varying gatE (WAVE) attention mechanism equipped with both Autoregressive (AR) and Moving-average (MA) components. It can adapt to various attention mechanisms, enhancing and decoupling their ability to capture long-range and local temporal patterns in time series data. In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for the time series forecasting (TSF) task, the previously overlooked decoder-only autoregressive Transformer model can achieve results comparable to the best baselines when appropriate tokenization and training methods are applied. Moreover, inspired by the ARMA model from statistics and recent advances in linear attention, we introduce the full ARMA structure into existing autoregressive attention mechanisms. By using an indirect MA weight generation method, we incorporate the MA term while maintaining the time complexity and parameter size of the underlying efficient attention models. We further explore how indirect parameter generation can produce implicit MA weights that align with the modeling requirements for local temporal impacts. Experimental results show that WAVE attention that incorporates the ARMA structure consistently improves the performance of various AR attentions on TSF tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.03159v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GAMformer: Bridging Tabular Foundation Models and Interpretable Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04560</link><description>arXiv:2410.04560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While interpretability is crucial for machine learning applications in safety-critical domains and for regulatory compliance, existing tabular foundation models like TabPFN lack transparency. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) provide the needed interpretability through their additive structure, but traditional GAM methods rely on iterative learning algorithms (such as splines, boosted trees, or neural networks) that are fundamentally incompatible with the in-context learning paradigm of foundation models. In this paper, we introduce GAMformer, the first tabular foundation model for GAMs that bridges the gap between the power of foundation models and the interpretability requirements of critical real-world applications. GAMformer estimates GAM shape functions in a single forward pass using in-context learning, representing a significant departure from conventional iterative approaches. Building on previous research on tabular foundation models, we train GAMformer exclusively on synthetically generated tables to prevent data leakage. Our experiments demonstrate that GAMformer performs comparably to other leading GAMs across various classification benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.04560v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EUGens: Efficient, Unified, and General Dense Layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09771</link><description>arXiv:2410.09771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.09771v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Solving Prior Distribution Mismatch in Diffusion Models via Optimal Transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13431</link><description>arXiv:2410.13431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable progress in generative modeling. However, the mismatch between the forward terminal distribution and reverse initial distribution introduces prior error, leading to deviations of sampling trajectories from the true distribution and severely limiting model performance. This issue further triggers cascading problems, including non-zero Signal-to-Noise Ratio, accumulated denoising errors, degraded generation quality, and constrained sampling efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes a prior error elimination framework based on Optimal Transport (OT). Specifically, an OT map from the reverse initial distribution to the forward terminal distribution is constructed to achieve precise matching of the two distributions. Meanwhile, the upper bound of the prior error is quantified using the Wasserstein distance, proving that the prior error can be effectively eliminated via the OT map. Additionally, by deriving the asymptotic consistency between dynamic OT and probability flow, this method is revealed to be highly compatible with the intrinsic mechanism of the diffusion process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method completely eliminates the prior error both theoretically and practically, providing a universal and rigorous solution for optimizing the performance of DMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.13431v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FilMBot: A High-Speed Soft Parallel Robotic Micromanipulator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23059</link><description>arXiv:2410.23059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft robotic manipulators are generally slow despite their great adaptability, resilience, and compliance. This limitation also extends to current soft robotic micromanipulators. Here, we introduce FilMBot, a 3-DOF film-based, electromagnetically actuated, soft kinematic robotic micromanipulator achieving speeds up to 2117 {\deg}/s and 2456 {\deg}/s in {\alpha} and \{beta} angular motions, with corresponding linear velocities of 1.61 m/s and 1.92 m/s using a 4-cm needle end-effector, 0.54 m/s along the Z axis, and 1.57 m/s during Z-axis morph switching. The robot can reach ~1.50 m/s in path-following tasks, with an operational bandwidth below ~30 Hz, and remains responsive at 50 Hz. It demonstrates high precision (~6.3 {\mu}m, or ~0.05% of its workspace) in path-following tasks, with precision remaining largely stable across frequencies. The novel combination of the low-stiffness soft kinematic film structure and strong electromagnetic actuation in FilMBot opens new avenues for soft robotics. Furthermore, its simple construction and inexpensive, readily accessible components could broaden the application of micromanipulators beyond current academic and professional users.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.23059v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LIBMoE: A Library for comprehensive benchmarking Mixture of Experts in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00918</link><description>arXiv:2411.00918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture of experts (MoE) architectures have become a cornerstone for scaling up and are a key component in most large language models such as GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-V3, Llama-4, and Gemini-2.5. However, systematic research on MoE remains severely constrained by the prohibitive computational costs of training and evaluation, restricting large-scale studies accessible to most researchers. We introduce LibMoE, a unified framework for reproducible, efficient, and extensible MoE research that supports both pretraining and sparse-upcycling regimes. Beyond unified implementations, the framework provides transparent analytical tools for probing routing and expert dynamics. Leveraging this foundation, we conduct a comprehensive analysis along three dimensions: (i) routing dynamics, covering expert selection patterns, routing stability and optimality, and how routing entropy reveals task specialization and expert diversity; (ii) the effect of lightweight initialization on load balancing, demonstrating how subtle changes in router initialization shape early expert utilization; and (iii) training regime differences, revealing how sparse upcycling and full pretraining exhibit distinct routing patterns and stability profiles. By lowering the barrier to entry and standardizing evaluation, along with our comprehensive analysis, LibMoE broadens access to MoE research and establishes a reliable benchmark to guide future innovations.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes with high fidelity and efficiency remains a central pursuit in computer vision and graphics. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable photorealistic rendering with Gaussian primitives, yet the modeling process remains governed predominantly by photometric supervision. This reliance often leads to irregular spatial distribution and indiscriminate primitive adjustments that largely ignore underlying geometric context. In this work, we rethink Gaussian modeling from a geometric standpoint and introduce Mini-Splatting2, an efficient scene modeling framework that couples structure-aware distribution and region-prioritized optimization, driving 3DGS into a geometry-regulated paradigm. The structure-aware distribution enforces spatial regularity through structured reorganization and representation sparsity, ensuring balanced structural coverage for compact organization. The region-prioritized optimization improves training discrimination through geometric saliency and computational selectivity, fostering appropriate structural emergence for fast convergence. These mechanisms alleviate the long-standing tension among representation compactness, convergence acceleration, and rendering fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mini-Splatting2 achieves up to 4$\times$ fewer Gaussians and 3$\times$ faster optimization while maintaining state-of-the-art visual quality, paving the way towards structured and efficient 3D Gaussian modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.12788v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Energy Guided smoothness to improve Robustness in Graph Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08419</link><description>arXiv:2412.08419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful at solving graph classification tasks, yet applied problems often contain noisy labels. In this work, we study GNN robustness to label noise, demonstrate GNN failure modes when models struggle to generalise on low-order graphs, low label coverage, or when a model is over-parameterized. We establish both empirical and theoretical links between GNN robustness and the reduction of the total Dirichlet Energy of learned node representations, which encapsulates the hypothesized GNN smoothness inductive bias. Finally, we introduce two training strategies to enhance GNN robustness: (1) by incorporating a novel inductive bias in the weight matrices through the removal of negative eigenvalues, connected to Dirichlet Energy minimization; (2) by extending to GNNs a loss penalty that promotes learned smoothness. Importantly, neither approach negatively impacts performance in noise-free settings, supporting our hypothesis that the source of GNNs robustness is their smoothness inductive bias.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.08419v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAD: Region-Aware Diffusion Models for Image Inpainting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09191</link><description>arXiv:2412.09191v5 Announce Type: replace

Existing methods either hijack the reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model or cast the problem into a larger framework, \ie, conditioned generation. However, these approaches often require nested loops in the generation process or additional components for conditioning. In this paper, we present region-aware diffusion models (RAD) for inpainting with a simple yet effective reformulation of the vanilla diffusion models. RAD utilizes a different noise schedule for each pixel, which allows local regions to be generated asynchronously while considering the global image context. A plain reverse process requires no additional components, enabling RAD to achieve inference time up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune RAD based on other pretrained diffusion models, reducing computational burdens in training as well. Experiments demonstrated that RAD provides state-of-the-art results both qualitatively and quantitatively, on the FFHQ, LSUN Bedroom, and ImageNet datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.09191v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Subspaces of Policies for Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14865</link><description>arXiv:2412.14865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Continual Reinforcement Learning setup, where a learning agent must continuously adapt to new tasks while retaining previously acquired skill sets, with a focus on the challenge of avoiding forgetting past gathered knowledge and ensuring scalability with the growing number of tasks. Such issues prevail in autonomous robotics and video game simulations, notably for navigation tasks prone to topological or kinematic changes. To address these issues, we introduce HiSPO, a novel hierarchical framework designed specifically for continual learning in navigation settings from offline data. Our method leverages distinct policy subspaces of neural networks to enable flexible and efficient adaptation to new tasks while preserving existing knowledge. We demonstrate, through a careful experimental study, the effectiveness of our method in both classical MuJoCo maze environments and complex video game-like navigation simulations, showcasing competitive performances and satisfying adaptability with respect to classical continual learning metrics, in particular regarding the memory usage and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.14865v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can MLLMs generate human-like feedback in grading multimodal short answers?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19755</link><description>arXiv:2412.19755v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In education, the traditional Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) with feedback problem has focused primarily on evaluating text-only responses. However, real-world assessments often include multimodal responses containing both diagrams and text. To address this limitation, we introduce the Multimodal Short Answer Grading with Feedback (MMSAF) problem, which requires jointly evaluating textual and diagrammatic content while also providing explanatory feedback. Collecting data representative of such multimodal responses is challenging due to both scale and logistical constraints. To mitigate this, we develop an automated data generation framework that leverages LLM hallucinations to mimic common student errors, thereby constructing a dataset of 2,197 instances. We evaluate 4 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across 3 STEM subjects, showing that MLLMs achieve accuracies of up to 62.5% in predicting answer correctness (correct/partially correct/incorrect) and up to 80.36% in assessing image relevance. This also includes a human evaluation with 9 annotators across 5 parameters, including a rubric-based approach. The rubrics also serve as a way to evaluate the feedback quality semantically rather than using overlap-based approaches. Our findings highlight which MLLMs are better suited for such tasks while also pointing out to drawbacks of the remaining MLLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.19755v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic Generalized Dynamic Games with Coupled Chance Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02279</link><description>arXiv:2501.02279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates stochastic generalized dynamic games with coupling chance constraints, where agents have incomplete information about uncertainties satisfying a concentration of measure property. This problem, in general, is non-convex and NP-hard. To address this, we propose a convex under-approximation by replacing chance constraints with tightened expected-value constraints, yielding a tractable game. We prove the existence of a stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium (SGNE) in this new game and show that its variational SGNE is an $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$-SGNE for the original game, with $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ expressed via the approximation errors and Lagrange multipliers. A semi-decentralized, sampling-based algorithm with time-varying step sizes is developed, requiring no prior knowledge of the uncertainty distribution or expectation evaluations. Unlike existing methods, it avoids step-size tuning based on Lipschitz constants or adaptive rules. Under standard assumptions on the pseudo-gradient, the algorithm converges almost surely to an SGNE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.02279v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HistoryPalette: Supporting Exploration and Reuse of Past Alternatives in Image Generation and Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04163</link><description>arXiv:2501.04163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creative tasks require creators to iteratively produce, select, and discard potentially useful ideas. Now, creativity tools include generative AI features (e.g., Photoshop Generative Fill) that increase the number of alternatives creators consider through rapid experiments with prompts and random generations. Creators use tedious manual systems for organizing their prior ideas by saving file versions or hiding layers, but they lack the support they want for reusing prior alternatives in personal work or in communication with others. We present HistoryPalette, a system that supports exploration and reuse of prior designs in generative image creation and editing. Using HistoryPalette, creators and their collaborators explore a "palette" of prior design alternatives organized by spatial position, topic category, and creation time. HistoryPalette enables creators to quickly preview and reuse their prior work. In creative professional and client collaborator user studies, participants generated and edited images by exploring and reusing past design alternatives with HistoryPalette.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.04163v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A theoretical analysis on the inversion of matrices via Neural Networks designed with Strassen algorithm</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06539</link><description>arXiv:2501.06539v4 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Dense encoders and LLM-based rerankers struggle with long documents: single-vector representations dilute fine-grained relevance, while cross-encoders are often too expensive for practical reranking. We present an efficient long-document reranking framework based on block-level embeddings. Each document is segmented into short blocks and encoded into block embeddings that can be precomputed offline. Given a query, we encode it once and score each candidate document by aggregating top-k query-block similarities with a simple weighted sum, yielding a strong and interpretable block-level relevance signal. To capture dependencies among the selected blocks and suppress redundancy, we introduce Top-k Interaction Refinement (TIR), a lightweight setwise module that applies query-conditioned attention over the top-k blocks and produces a bounded residual correction to block scores. TIR introduces only a small number of parameters and operates on top-k blocks, keeping query-time overhead low. Experiments on long-document reranking benchmarks (TREC DL and MLDR-zh) show that block representations substantially improve over single-vector encoders, and TIR provides consistent additional gains over strong long-document reranking baselines while maintaining practical reranking latency. For example, on TREC DL 2023, NDCG at 10 improves from 0.395 to 0.451 with the same block budget k = 65, using at most 4095 tokens. The resulting model supports interpretability by exposing which blocks drive each document's score and how refinement redistributes their contributions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.17039v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DietGlance: Dietary Monitoring and Personalized Analysis at a Glance with Knowledge-Empowered AI Assistant</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01317</link><description>arXiv:2502.01317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing awareness of wellness has prompted people to consider whether their dietary patterns align with their health and fitness goals. In response, researchers have introduced various wearable dietary monitoring systems and dietary assessment approaches. However, these solutions are either limited to identifying foods with simple ingredients or insufficient in providing an analysis of individual dietary behaviors with domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present DietGlance, a system that automatically monitors dietary behaviors in daily routines and delivers personalized analysis from knowledge sources. DietGlance first detects ingestive episodes from multimodal inputs using eyeglasses, capturing privacy-preserving meal images of various dishes being consumed. Based on the inferred food items and consumed quantities from these images, DietGlance further provides nutritional analysis and personalized dietary suggestions, empowered by the retrieval-augmented generation module on a reliable nutrition library. A short-term user study (N=33) and a four-week longitudinal study (N=16) demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of DietGlance, offering insights and implications for future AI-assisted dietary monitoring and personalized healthcare intervention systems using eyewear.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.01317v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human Body Restoration with One-Step Diffusion Model and A New Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01411</link><description>arXiv:2502.01411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human body restoration, as a specific application of image restoration, is widely applied in practice and plays a vital role across diverse fields. However, thorough research remains difficult, particularly due to the lack of benchmark datasets. In this study, we propose a high-quality dataset automated cropping and filtering (HQ-ACF) pipeline. This pipeline leverages existing object detection datasets and other unlabeled images to automatically crop and filter high-quality human images. Using this pipeline, we constructed a person-based restoration with sophisticated objects and natural activities (\emph{PERSONA}) dataset, which includes training, validation, and test sets. The dataset significantly surpasses other human-related datasets in both quality and content richness. Finally, we propose \emph{OSDHuman}, a novel one-step diffusion model for human body restoration. Specifically, we propose a high-fidelity image embedder (HFIE) as the prompt generator to better guide the model with low-quality human image information, effectively avoiding misleading prompts. Experimental results show that OSDHuman outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Abstract: Inspired by human SYSTEM 2 thinking, LLMs excel at complex reasoning tasks via extended Chain-of-Thought. However, similar test-time scaling for diffusion models to tackle complex reasoning remains largely unexplored. From existing work, two primary challenges emerge in this setting: (i) the dependence on an external verifier indicating a notable gap from intrinsic reasoning of human intelligence without any external feedback, and (ii) the lack of an efficient search algorithm. In this paper, we introduce the Verifier-free Test-time Scalable Diffusion Model (VFScale) to achieve scalable intrinsic reasoning, which equips number-of-sample test-time scaling with the intrinsic energy function of diffusion models as the verifier. Concretely, VFScale comprises two key innovations to address the aforementioned challenges. On the training side, VFScale consists of a novel MRNCL loss and a KL regularization to improve the energy landscape, ensuring that the learned energy function itself serves as a reliable verifier. On the inference side, VFScale integrates the denoising process with a novel hybrid Monte Carlo Tree Search (hMCTS) to improve search efficiency. On challenging reasoning tasks of Maze and Sudoku, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VFScale's training objective and scalable inference method. In particular, trained with Maze sizes of up to $6\times6$, our VFScale solves 88% of Maze problems with much larger sizes of $15\times15$, while standard diffusion models completely fail.

Abstract: Disentanglement learning is central to understanding and reusing learned representations in variational autoencoders (VAEs). Although equivariance has been explored in this context, effectively exploiting it for disentanglement remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Multiple Invertible and Partial-Equivariant Transformation (MIPE-Transformation), which integrates two main parts: (1) Invertible and Partial-Equivariant Transformation (IPE-Transformation), guaranteeing an invertible latent-to-transformed-latent mapping while preserving partial input-to-latent equivariance in the transformed latent space; and (2) Exponential-Family Conversion (EF-Conversion) to extend the standard Gaussian prior to an approximate exponential family via a learnable conversion. In experiments on the 3D Cars, 3D Shapes, and dSprites datasets, MIPE-Transformation improves the disentanglement performance of state-of-the-art VAEs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.03740v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EigenLoRAx: Recycling Adapters to Find Principal Subspaces for Resource-Efficient Adaptation and Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04700</link><description>arXiv:2502.04700v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large models has raised concerns about their environmental impact and equity in accessibility due to significant computational costs. Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) offer a lightweight solution for finetuning large models, resulting in an abundance of publicly available adapters tailored to diverse domains. We ask: Can these pretrained adapters be leveraged to further streamline adaptation to new tasks while addressing these challenges? We introduce EigenLoRAx, a parameter-efficient finetuning method that recycles existing adapters to create a principal subspace aligned with their shared domain knowledge which can be further augmented with orthogonal basis vectors in low-resource scenarios. This enables rapid adaptation to new tasks by learning only lightweight coefficients on the principal components of the subspace-eliminating the need to finetune entire adapters. EigenLoRAx requires significantly fewer parameters and memory, improving efficiency for both training and inference. Our method demonstrates strong performance across diverse domains and tasks, offering a scalable for edge-based applications, personalization, and equitable deployment of large models in resource-constrained environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.04700v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Linear Transformers as VAR Models: Aligning Autoregressive Attention Mechanisms with Autoregressive Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07244</link><description>arXiv:2502.07244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive attention-based time series forecasting (TSF) has drawn increasing interest, with mechanisms like linear attention sometimes outperforming vanilla attention. However, deeper Transformer architectures frequently misalign with autoregressive objectives, obscuring the underlying VAR structure embedded within linear attention and hindering their ability to capture the data generative processes in TSF. In this work, we first show that a single linear attention layer can be interpreted as a dynamic vector autoregressive (VAR) structure. We then explain that existing multi-layer Transformers have structural mismatches with the autoregressive forecasting objective, which impair interpretability and generalization ability. To address this, we show that by rearranging the MLP, attention, and input-output flow, multi-layer linear attention can also be aligned as a VAR model. Then, we propose Structural Aligned Mixture of VAR (SAMoVAR), a linear Transformer variant that integrates interpretable dynamic VAR weights for multivariate TSF. By aligning the Transformer architecture with autoregressive objectives, SAMoVAR delivers improved performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency, comparing to SOTA TSF models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.07244v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GenIAS: Generator for Instantiating Anomalies in time Series</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08262</link><description>arXiv:2502.08262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic anomaly injection is a recent and promising approach for time series anomaly detection (TSAD), but existing methods rely on ad hoc, hand-crafted strategies applied to raw time series that fail to capture diverse and complex anomalous patterns, particularly in multivariate settings. We propose a synthetic anomaly generation method named Generator for Instantiating Anomalies in Time Series (GenIAS), which generates realistic and diverse anomalies via a novel learnable perturbation in the latent space of a variational autoencoder. This enables abnormal patterns to be injected across different temporal segments at varying scales based on variational reparameterization. To generate anomalies that align with normal patterns while remaining distinguishable, we introduce a learning strategy that jointly learns the perturbation scale and compact latent representations via a tunable prior, which improves the distinguishability of generated anomalies, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments show that GenIAS produces more diverse and realistic anomalies, and that detection models trained with these anomalies outperform 17 baseline methods on 9 popular TSAD benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.08262v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Video Soundtrack Generation by Aligning Emotions and Temporal Boundaries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10154</link><description>arXiv:2502.10154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing soundtracks for videos remains a costly and time-consuming challenge for multimedia content creators. We introduce EMSYNC, an automatic video-based symbolic music generator that creates music aligned with a video's emotional content and temporal boundaries. It follows a two-stage framework, where a pretrained video emotion classifier extracts emotional features, and a conditional music generator produces MIDI sequences guided by both emotional and temporal cues. We introduce boundary offsets, a novel temporal conditioning mechanism that enables the model to anticipate upcoming video scene cuts and align generated musical chords with them. We also propose a mapping scheme that bridges the discrete categorical outputs of the video emotion classifier with the continuous valence-arousal inputs required by the emotion-conditioned MIDI generator, enabling seamless integration of emotion information across different representations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in objective and subjective evaluations across different video datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating music aligned to video both emotionally and temporally.

Abstract: Most commonly used non-linear machine learning methods are closed-box models, uninterpretable to humans. The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to develop tools to examine the inner workings of these closed boxes. An often-used model-agnostic approach to XAI involves using simple models as local approximations to produce so-called local explanations; examples of this approach include LIME, SHAP, and SLISEMAP. This paper shows how a large set of local explanations can be reduced to a small "proxy set" of simple models, which can act as a generative global explanation. This reduction procedure, ExplainReduce, can be formulated as an optimisation problem and approximated efficiently using greedy heuristics. We show that, for many problems, as few as five explanations can faithfully emulate the closed-box model and that our reduction procedure is competitive with other model aggregation methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.10311v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TextOCVP: Object-Centric Video Prediction with Language Guidance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11655</link><description>arXiv:2502.11655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and forecasting future scene states is critical for autonomous agents to plan and act effectively in complex environments. Object-centric models, with structured latent spaces, have shown promise in modeling object dynamics and predicting future scene states, but often struggle to scale beyond simple synthetic datasets and to integrate external guidance, limiting their applicability in robotics. To address these limitations, we propose TextOCVP, an object-centric model for video prediction guided by textual descriptions. TextOCVP parses an observed scene into object representations, called slots, and utilizes a text-conditioned transformer predictor to forecast future object states and video frames. Our approach jointly models object dynamics and interactions while incorporating textual guidance, enabling accurate and controllable predictions. TextOCVP's structured latent space offers a more precise control of the forecasting process, outperforming several video prediction baselines on two datasets. Additionally, we show that structured object-centric representations provide superior robustness to novel scene configurations, as well as improved controllability and interpretability, enabling more precise and understandable predictions.

Abstract: Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to reduce overconfidence in neural network predictions and improve generalization. Despite these benefits, recent studies reveal two critical issues with LS. First, LS induces overconfidence in misclassified samples. Second, it compacts feature representations into overly tight clusters, diluting intra-class diversity, although the precise cause of this phenomenon remained elusive. In this paper, we analytically decompose the LS-induced loss, exposing two key terms: (i) a regularization term that dampens overconfidence only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-amplification term that arises under misclassifications. This latter term compels the network to reinforce incorrect predictions with undue certainty, exacerbating representation collapse. To address these shortcomings, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which applies uniform regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit rather than the ground-truth logit. Through extensive feature-space analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Experiments on large-scale image classification and multiple downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) games, particularly those designed for head-mounted displays, have grown increasingly prevalent. However, most existing systems depend on pre-scanned, static environments and rely heavily on continuous tracking or marker-based solutions, which limit adaptability in dynamic physical spaces. This is particularly problematic for AR headsets and glasses, which typically follow the user's head movement and cannot maintain a fixed, stationary view of the scene. Moreover, continuous scene observation is neither power-efficient nor practical for wearable devices, given their limited battery and processing capabilities. A persistent challenge arises when multiple identical objects are present in the environment-standard object tracking pipelines often fail to maintain consistent identities without uninterrupted observation or external sensors. These limitations hinder fluid physical-virtual interactions, especially in dynamic or occluded scenes where continuous tracking is infeasible. To address this, we introduce a novel optimization-based framework for re-identifying identical objects in AR scenes using only one partial egocentric observation frame captured by a headset. We formulate the problem as a label assignment task solved via integer programming, augmented with a Voronoi diagram-based pruning strategy to improve computational efficiency. This method reduces computation time by 50% while preserving 91% accuracy in simulated experiments. Moreover, we evaluated our approach in quantitative synthetic and quantitative real-world experiments. We also conducted three qualitative real-world experiments to demonstrate the practical utility and generalizability for enabling dynamic, markerless object interaction in AR environments.

Abstract: Sustaining knowledge infrastructures remains a persistent issue that requires continued engagement from diverse stakeholders as new questions and values arise in relation to KI maintenance. We draw on existing academic literature, practical experience with KI projects, and our discussions at a 2024 workshop for researchers and practitioners exploring KI evaluation to pose five questions for KI project managers to consider when thinking about how to make their KIs evolve sustainably over time. These questions include reflecting on sustainability throughout the life cycle of KIs, communicating evolving visions and values, engaging communities, right sizing a KI, and developing an iterative process for decision-making. Reflecting on these themes, we suggest, can support KI stakeholders to evolve, not necessarily grow, to meet the needs and values of their communities. How these themes are discussed will necessarily vary by funding sources, disciplines, governance, communities, and other contextual factors. However, adopting a deliberate and strategic approach to KI sustainability and aligning the invisible infrastructural work of KI maintenance with the outward-facing institutional work is, we argue, relevant to all KIs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.19360v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are foundation models useful feature extractors for electroencephalography analysis?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21086</link><description>arXiv:2502.21086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has motivated similar approaches in time series analysis. While foundational time series models have proven beneficial on a variety of tasks, their effectiveness in medical applications with limited data remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate this question in the context of electroencephalography (EEG) by evaluating general-purpose time series models on age prediction, seizure detection, and classification of clinically relevant EEG events. We compare their diagnostic performance against specialised EEG models and assess the quality of the extracted features. The results show that general-purpose models are competitive and capture features useful to localising demographic and disease-related biomarkers. These findings indicate that foundational time series models can reduce the reliance on large task-specific datasets and models, making them valuable in clinical practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.21086v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Invisible Walls in Cities: Designing LLM Agent to Predict Urban Segregation Experience with Social Media Content</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04773</link><description>arXiv:2503.04773v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding experienced segregation in urban daily life is crucial for addressing societal inequalities and fostering inclusivity. The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives.

Specifically, we propose a reflective LLM coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction.
  Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our agent substantially improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R$^{2}$ and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving places of interest (POIs)' social inclusiveness. Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with Web technology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.04773v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vision-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in Multimodal Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06749</link><description>arXiv:2503.06749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. Scaling up the amount of multimodal math data in the RL training, Vision-R1-32B and Vison-R1-72B achieves 76.4% and 78.2% MathVista benchmark scores, respectively. The datasets and code will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-R1 .</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.06749v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hidden in Plain Sight -- Class Competition Focuses Attribution Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07346</link><description>arXiv:2503.07346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attribution methods reveal which input features a neural network uses for a prediction, adding transparency to their decisions. A common problem is that these attributions seem unspecific, highlighting both important and irrelevant features. We revisit the common attribution pipeline and observe that using logits as attribution target is a main cause of this phenomenon. We show that the solution is in plain sight: considering distributions of attributions over multiple classes using existing attribution methods yields specific and fine-grained attributions. On common benchmarks, including the grid-pointing game and randomization-based sanity checks, this improves the ability of 18 attribution methods across 7 architectures up to 2x, agnostic to model architecture.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.07346v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fin-R1: A Large Language Model for Financial Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16252</link><description>arXiv:2503.16252v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, general-purpose large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, Claude, and DeepSeek have advanced at an unprecedented pace. Despite these achievements, their application to finance remains challenging, due to fragmented data sources, intransparent reasoning processes, and weak transferability to business applications. In response, we introduce Fin-R1, a reasoning LLM designed for financial scenarios. With a compact size of 7 billion parameters, Fin-R1 reduces deployment costs while addressing the aforementioned challenges. Its development follows a two-stage pipeline. First, we construct Fin-R1-Data, a high-quality financial dataset consisting of 60,091 chain-of-thought (CoT) samples, distilled and filtered from multiple authoritative benchmarks to ensure consistency and reliability. Second, we train Fin-R1 using Fin-R1-Data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by reinforcement learning (RL). This stage substantially improves the model's ability to solve complex financial reasoning tasks, yielding outputs that are both accurate and interpretable. Despite its relatively small parameter scale, Fin-R1 achieves competitive empirical performance across established financial benchmarks and demonstrates practical utility in compliance checking and robo-advisory. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/SUFE-AIFLM-Lab/Fin-R1, and has already attracted over 700 stars.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.16252v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Collaborating with AI Agents: Field Experiments on Teamwork, Productivity, and Performance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18238</link><description>arXiv:2503.18238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examined the mechanisms underlying productivity and performance gains from AI agents using a large-scale experiment on Pairit, a platform we developed to study human-AI collaboration. We randomly assigned 2,234 participants to human-human and human-AI teams that produced 11,024 ads for a think tank. We evaluated the ads using independent human ratings and a field experiment on X which garnered ~5M impressions. We found human-AI teams produced 50% more ads per worker and higher text quality, while human-human teams produced higher image quality, suggesting a jagged frontier of AI agent capability. Human-AI teams also produced more homogeneous, or self-similar, outputs. The field experiment revealed higher text quality improved click-through rates and view-through duration, while higher image quality improved cost-per-click rates. We found three mechanisms explained these effects. First, human-AI collaboration was more task-oriented, with 25% more task-oriented messages and 18% fewer interpersonal messages. Second, human-AI collaboration displayed more delegation, as participants delegated 17% more work to AI agents than to human partners and performed 62% fewer direct text edits when working with AI. Third, recognition that the collaborator was an AI moderated these effects as participants who correctly identified they were working with AI were more task-oriented and more likely to delegate work. These mechanisms then explained performance as task-oriented communication improved ad quality, specifically when working with AI, while interpersonal communication reduced ad quality; delegation improved text quality but had no effect on image quality and was positively associated with diversity collapse, creating homogeneous outputs of higher average quality. The results suggest AI agents drive changes in productivity, performance, and output diversity by reshaping teamwork.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.18238v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Haptic bilateral teleoperation system for free-hand dental procedures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21288</link><description>arXiv:2503.21288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-hand dental procedures are typically repetitive, time-consuming and require high precision and manual dexterity. Robots can play a key role in improving procedural accuracy and safety, enhancing patient comfort, and reducing operator workload. However, robotic solutions for free-hand procedures remain limited or completely lacking. To address this gap, we develop a haptic bilateral teleoperation system (HBTS) for free-hand dental procedures (FH-HBTS). The system includes a mechanical end-effector, compatible with standard clinical tools, and equipped with an endoscopic camera for improved visibility of the intervention site. By ensuring motion and force correspondence between the operator's and the robot's actions, monitored through visual feedback, we enhance the operator's sensory awareness and motor accuracy. Furthermore, to ensure procedural safety, we limit interaction forces by scaling the motion references provided to the admittance controller based solely on measured contact forces. This ensures effective force limitation in all contact states without requiring prior knowledge of the environment. The proposed FH-HBTS is validated both through a technical evaluation and an in-vitro pre-clinical study conducted on a dental model under clinically representative conditions. The results show that the system improves the naturalness, safety, and accuracy of teleoperation, highlighting its potential to enhance free-hand dental procedures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.21288v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CMD-HAR: Cross-Modal Disentanglement for Wearable Human Activity Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21843</link><description>arXiv:2503.21843v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a fundamental technology for numerous human - centered intelligent applications. Although deep learning methods have been utilized to accelerate feature extraction, issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment remain largely unresolved. The aim of this paper is to address issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment in sensor-based human activity recognition. We propose a spatiotemporal attention modal decomposition alignment fusion strategy to tackle the problem of the mixed distribution of sensor data. Key discriminative features of activities are captured through cross-modal spatio-temporal disentangled representation, and gradient modulation is combined to alleviate data heterogeneity. In addition, a wearable deployment simulation system is constructed. We conducted experiments on a large number of public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.21843v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Solving the Fokker-Planck equation of discretized Dean-Kawasaki models with functional hierarchical tensor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22816</link><description>arXiv:2503.22816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel numerical scheme for solving the Fokker-Planck equation of discretized Dean-Kawasaki models with a functional tensor network ansatz. The Dean-Kawasaki model describes density fluctuations of interacting particle systems, and it is a highly singular stochastic partial differential equation. By performing a finite-volume discretization of the Dean-Kawasaki model, we derive a stochastic differential equation (SDE). To fully characterize the discretized Dean-Kawasaki model, we solve the associated Fokker-Planck equation of the SDE dynamics. In particular, we use a particle-based approach whereby the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation is obtained by performing a series of density estimation tasks from the simulated trajectories, and we use a functional hierarchical tensor model to represent the density. To address the challenge that the sample trajectories are supported on a simplex, we apply a coordinate transformation from the simplex to a Euclidean space by logarithmic parameterization, after which we apply a sketching-based density estimation procedure on the transformed variables. Our approach is general and can be applied to general density estimation tasks over a simplex. We apply the proposed method successfully to the 1D and 2D Dean-Kawasaki models. Moreover, we show that the proposed approach is highly accurate in the presence of external potential and particle interaction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.22816v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAP-CoPE: Social-Aware Planning using Cooperative Pose Estimation with Infrastructure Sensor Nodes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05727</link><description>arXiv:2504.05727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate smoothly in human-populated indoor environments, where challenges arise including limited perception and occlusions when relying only on onboard sensors, as well as the need for socially compliant motion planning that accounts for human psychological comfort zones. These factors complicate accurate recognition of human intentions and the generation of comfortable, socially aware trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose SAP-CoPE, an indoor navigation system that integrates cooperative infrastructure with a novel 3D human pose estimation method and a socially-aware model predictive control (MPC)-based motion planner. In the perception module, an optimization problem is formulated to account for uncertainty propagation in the camera projection matrix while enforcing human joint coherence. The proposed method is adaptable to both single- and multi-camera configurations and can incorporate sparse LiDAR point-cloud data. For motion planning, we integrate a psychology inspired personal-space field using the information from estimated human poses into an MPC framework to enhance socially comfort in human-populated environments. Extensive real-world evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating socially aware trajectories for autonomous systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.05727v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TASTE: Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding for Spoken Language Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07053</link><description>arXiv:2504.07053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent efforts target spoken language models (SLMs) that not only listen but also speak for more natural human-LLM interaction. Joint speech-text modeling is a promising direction to achieve this. However, the effectiveness of recent speech tokens for joint modeling remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding (TASTE), a method that directly addresses the modality gap by aligning speech token with the corresponding text transcription during the tokenization stage. We propose a method that can achieve this through a attention-based aggregation mechanism and with speech reconstruction as the training objective. We conduct extensive experiments and show that TASTE can preserve essential paralinguistic information while dramatically reducing the token sequence length. With TASTE, we perform straightforward joint spoken language modeling by using Low-Rank Adaptation on the pre-trained text LLM. Experimental results show that TASTE-based SLMs perform comparable to previous work on SALMON and StoryCloze; while significantly outperform other pre-trained SLMs on speech continuation across subjective and objective evaluations. To our knowledge, TASTE is the first end-to-end approach that utilizes a reconstruction objective to automatically learn a text-aligned speech tokenization and embedding suitable for spoken language modeling. Our demo, code, and model are available at https://mtkresearch.github.io/TASTE-SpokenLM.github.io.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.07053v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LayoutCoT: Unleashing the Deep Reasoning Potential of Large Language Models for Layout Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10829</link><description>arXiv:2504.10829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional layout generation aims to automatically generate visually appealing and semantically coherent layouts from user-defined constraints. While recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results, they typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive fine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability. Alternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which restrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts. To this end, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms layout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for processing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective retrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout, together with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT reasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both semantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring training or fine-tuning. Notably, our CoT reasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep reasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as deepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.10829v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Doppler-SLAM: Doppler-Aided Radar-Inertial and LiDAR-Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11634</link><description>arXiv:2504.11634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a critical capability for autonomous systems. Traditional SLAM approaches, which often rely on visual or LiDAR sensors, face significant challenges in adverse conditions such as low light or featureless environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Doppler-aided radar-inertial and LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages the complementary strengths of 4D radar, FMCW LiDAR, and inertial measurement units. Our system integrates Doppler velocity measurements and spatial data into a tightly-coupled front-end and graph optimization back-end to provide enhanced ego velocity estimation, accurate odometry, and robust mapping. We also introduce a Doppler-based scan-matching technique to improve front-end odometry in dynamic environments. In addition, our framework incorporates an innovative online extrinsic calibration mechanism, utilizing Doppler velocity and loop closure to dynamically maintain sensor alignment. Extensive evaluations on both public and proprietary datasets show that our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art radar-SLAM and LiDAR-SLAM frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Initial pilot studies indicated that users value this mixed-initiative approach, finding the balance between AI suggestions and direct manipulation crucial for maintaining interpretability and trust. We further demonstrate the system's capability through a case study analyzing 24 papers.

Abstract: Digital modeling and reconstruction of human faces serve various applications. However, its availability is often hindered by the requirements of data capturing devices, manual labor, and suitable actors. This situation restricts the diversity, expressiveness, and control over the resulting models. This work aims to demonstrate that a semantically controllable generative network can provide enhanced control over the digital face modeling process. To enhance diversity beyond the limited human faces scanned in a controlled setting, we introduce a novel data generation pipeline that creates a high-quality 3D face database using a pre-trained diffusion model. Our proposed normalization module converts synthesized data from the diffusion model into high-quality scanned data. Using the 44,000 face models we obtained, we further developed an efficient GAN-based generator. This generator accepts semantic attributes as input, and generates geometry and albedo. It also allows continuous post-editing of attributes in the latent space. Our asset refinement component subsequently creates physically-based facial assets. We introduce a comprehensive system designed for creating and editing high-quality face assets. Our proposed model has undergone extensive experiment, comparison and evaluation. We also integrate everything into a web-based interactive tool. We aim to make this tool publicly available with the release of the paper.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.15259v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StyleMe3D: Stylization with Disentangled Priors by Multiple Encoders on 3D Gaussians</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15281</link><description>arXiv:2504.15281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting stylization approaches are limited in their ability to represent diverse artistic styles, frequently defaulting to low-level texture replacement or yielding semantically inconsistent outputs. In this paper, we introduce StyleMe3D, a novel hierarchical framework that achieves comprehensive, high-fidelity stylization by disentangling multi-level style representations while preserving geometric fidelity. The cornerstone of StyleMe3D is Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), which harnesses latent priors from a style-aware diffusion model to provide high-level semantic guidance, ensuring robust and expressive style transfer. To further refine this distillation process, we propose a multi-modal alignment strategy using the CLIP latent space: a CLIP-based style stream evaluator (Contrastive Style Descriptor) that enforces middle-level stylistic similarity, and a CLIP-based content stream evaluator (3D Gaussian Quality Assessment) that acts as a global regularizer to mitigate typical GS quality degradation. Finally, a VGG-based Simultaneously Optimized Scale module is integrated to refine fine-grained texture details at the low-level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently preserves intricate geometric details and achieves coherent stylistic effects across entire scenes, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.15281v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Event2Vec: Processing Neuromorphic Events Directly by Representations in Vector Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15371</link><description>arXiv:2504.15371v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic event cameras possess superior temporal resolution, power efficiency, and dynamic range compared to traditional cameras. However, their asynchronous and sparse data format poses a significant challenge for conventional deep learning methods. Existing methods either convert the events into dense synchronous frame representations for processing by powerful CNNs or Transformers, but lose the asynchronous, sparse and high temporal resolution characteristics of events during the conversion process; or adopt irregular models such as sparse convolution, spiking neural networks, or graph neural networks to process the irregular event representations but fail to take full advantage of GPU acceleration. Inspired by word-to-vector models, we draw an analogy between words and events to introduce event2vec, a novel representation that allows neural networks to process events directly. This approach is fully compatible with the parallel processing capabilities of Transformers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of event2vec on the DVS Gesture, ASL-DVS, and DVS-Lip benchmarks, showing that event2vec is remarkably parameter-efficient, features high throughput and low latency, and achieves high accuracy even with an extremely low number of events or low spatial resolutions. Event2vec introduces a novel paradigm by demonstrating for the first time that sparse, irregular event data can be directly integrated into high-throughput Transformer architectures. This breakthrough resolves the long-standing conflict between maintaining data sparsity and maximizing GPU efficiency, offering a promising balance for real-time, low-latency neuromorphic vision tasks.

Abstract: All-in-One image restoration aims to address multiple image degradation problems using a single model, offering a more practical and versatile solution compared to designing dedicated models for each degradation type. Existing approaches typically rely on Degradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide image restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation information and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome these limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration framework that introduces a fine-grained degradation extractor and a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM). The DP-SSM leverages the fine-grained degradation features captured by the extractor as dynamic prompts, which are then incorporated into the state space modeling process. This enhances the model's adaptability to diverse degradation types, while a complementary High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB) recovers local high-frequency details. Extensive experiments on a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR achieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM, respectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of DPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.17732v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SynPAT: A System for Generating Synthetic Physical Theories with Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00878</link><description>arXiv:2505.00878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-assisted methods for discovering physical laws from background theory and data have recently emerged, promising to advance our understanding of the physical world. However, training and benchmarking these systems remains challenging: real physical theories are limited in number. To address this need, we introduce SynPAT, a system for generating synthetic physical theories with accompanying data. SynPAT produces: (i) a consistent set of axioms forming a synthetic theory, (ii) a symbolic consequence of these axioms representing the discovery target, and (iii) noisy data approximating this consequence. Crucially, to mirror historically incorrect theories (e.g., Newtonian mechanics before Special Relativity), SynPAT can also generate theories whose axioms do not strictly entail, and in fact conflict with, the observed consequence, requiring a correction to the assumed axioms to bridge the gap. We detail SynPAT's methodology and benchmark several open-source symbolic regression systems on our generated theories and data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.00878v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Histo-Miner: Deep learning based tissue features extraction pipeline from H&amp;E whole slide images of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04672</link><description>arXiv:2505.04672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in digital pathology have enabled comprehensive analysis of Whole-Slide Images (WSI) from tissue samples, leveraging high-resolution microscopy and computational capabilities. Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.907 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients.

Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is a promising approach for building state-of-the-art predictive models on multi-table relational data by representing it as a heterogeneous temporal graph. However, commonly used Graph Neural Network models suffer from fundamental limitations in capturing complex structural patterns and long-range dependencies that are inherent in relational data. While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on general graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique challenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive, heterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal dynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization schemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational Graph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed specifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element tokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features, type, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of heterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our architecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global attention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide representations. Across 21 tasks from the RelBench benchmark, RelGT consistently matches or outperforms GNN baselines by up to 18%, establishing Graph Transformers as a powerful architecture for Relational Deep Learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.10960v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improved Bag-of-Words Image Retrieval with Geometric Constraints for Ground Texture Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11620</link><description>arXiv:2505.11620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground texture localization using a downward-facing camera offers a low-cost, high-precision localization solution that is robust to dynamic environments and requires no environmental modification. We present a significantly improved bag-of-words (BoW) image retrieval system for ground texture localization, achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages an approximate $k$-means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately improve their results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.11620v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HBO: Hierarchical Balancing Optimization for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12300</link><description>arXiv:2505.12300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on a mixture of diverse datasets poses challenges due to data imbalance and heterogeneity. Existing methods often address these issues across datasets (globally) but overlook the imbalance and heterogeneity within individual datasets (locally), which limits their effectiveness. We introduce Hierarchical Balancing Optimization (HBO), a novel method that enables LLMs to autonomously adjust data allocation during fine-tuning both across datasets (globally) and within each individual dataset (locally). HBO employs a bilevel optimization strategy with two types of actors: a Global Actor, which balances data sampling across different subsets of the training mixture, and several Local Actors, which optimizes data usage within each subset based on difficulty levels. These actors are guided by reward functions derived from the LLM's training state, which measure learning progress and relative performance improvement. We evaluate HBO on three LLM backbones across nine diverse tasks in multilingual and multitask setups. Results show that HBO consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving significant accuracy gains. Our in-depth analysis further demonstrates that both the global actor and local actors of HBO effectively adjust data usage during fine-tuning. HBO provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of data imbalance and heterogeneity in LLM fine-tuning, enabling more effective training across diverse datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.12300v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Driven Local-Whole Elastic Deformation Modeling for Point Cloud Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13812</link><description>arXiv:2505.13812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing point cloud representation learning methods primarily rely on data-driven strategies to extract geometric information from large amounts of scattered data. However, most methods focus solely on the spatial distribution features of point clouds while overlooking the relationship between local information and the whole structure, which limits the accuracy of point cloud representation. Local information reflect the fine-grained variations of an object, while the whole structure is determined by the interaction and combination of these local features, collectively defining the object's shape. In real-world, objects undergo deformation under external forces, and this deformation gradually affects the whole structure through the propagation of forces from local regions, thereby altering the object's geometric features. Therefore, appropriately introducing a physics-driven mechanism to capture the topological relationships between local parts and the whole object can effectively mitigate for the limitations of data-driven point cloud methods in structural modeling, and enhance the generalization and interpretability of point cloud representations for downstream tasks such as understanding and recognition. Inspired by this, we incorporate a physics-driven mechanism into the data-driven method to learn fine-grained features in point clouds and model the structural relationship between local regions and the whole shape. Specifically, we design a dual-task encoder-decoder framework that combines the geometric modeling capability of data-driven implicit fields with physics-driven elastic deformation. Through the integration of physics-based loss functions, the framework is guided to predict localized deformation and explicitly capture the correspondence between local structural changes and whole shape variations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.13812v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LEANCODE: Understanding Models Better for Code Simplification of Pre-trained Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14759</link><description>arXiv:2505.14759v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models for code often entail significant computational complexity, which grows significantly with the length of the input code sequence. We propose LeanCode for code simplification to reduce training and prediction time, leveraging code contexts in utilizing attention scores to represent the tokens' importance. We advocate for the selective removal of tokens based on the average context-aware attention scores rather than average scores across all inputs. LeanCode uses the attention scores of `CLS' tokens within the encoder for classification tasks, such as code search. It also employs the encoder-decoder attention scores to determine token significance for sequence-to-sequence tasks like code summarization. Our evaluation shows LeanCode's superiority over the SOTAs DietCode and Slimcode, with improvements of 60% and 16% for code search, and 29% and 27% for code summarization, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.14759v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Image-to-Image Translation with Diffusion Transformers and CLIP-Based Image Conditioning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16001</link><description>arXiv:2505.16001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping between a source and a target domain, enabling tasks such as style transfer, appearance transformation, and domain adaptation. In this work, we explore a diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation by adapting Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which combine the denoising capabilities of diffusion models with the global modeling power of transformers. To guide the translation process, we condition the model on image embeddings extracted from a pre-trained CLIP encoder, allowing for fine-grained and structurally consistent translations without relying on text or class labels. We incorporate both a CLIP similarity loss to enforce semantic consistency and an LPIPS perceptual loss to enhance visual fidelity during training. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: face2comics, which translates real human faces to comic-style illustrations, and edges2shoes, which translates edge maps to realistic shoe images. Experimental results demonstrate that DiT, combined with CLIP-based conditioning and perceptual similarity objectives, achieves high-quality, semantically faithful translations, offering a promising alternative to GAN-based models for paired image-to-image translation tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.16001v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPhyR: Spatial-Physical Reasoning Benchmark on Material Distribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16048</link><description>arXiv:2505.16048v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset designed to benchmark the physical and spatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) based on topology optimization, a method for computing optimal material distributions within a design space under prescribed loads and supports. In this dataset, LLMs are provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.16048v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Guided Diffusion Sampling on Function Spaces with Applications to PDEs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17004</link><description>arXiv:2505.17004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for conditional sampling in PDE-based inverse problems, targeting the recovery of whole solutions from extremely sparse or noisy measurements. This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an unconditional, discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional Banach spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling approach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in function spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five PDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while reducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning ensures strong cross-resolution generalizability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of discretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and inverse problems in the context of PDEs.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become a cornerstone for complex reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), the faithfulness of the generated reasoning remains an open question. We investigate the Decoupling Hypothesis: that correct answers often mask fragile, post-hoc rationalizations that are not causally tied to the model's prediction. To systematically verify this, we introduce MATCHA, a novel Answer-Conditioned Probing framework. Unlike standard evaluations that focus on final output accuracy, MATCHA isolates the reasoning phase by conditioning generation on the model's predicted answer, allowing us to stress-test the stability of the rationale itself. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability: under imperceptible input perturbations, LLMs frequently maintain the correct answer while generating inconsistent or nonsensical reasoning - effectively being ``Right for the Wrong Reasons''. Using LLM judges to quantify this robustness gap, we find that multi-step and commonsense tasks are significantly more susceptible to this decoupling than logical tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversarial examples generated by MATCHA transfer non-trivially to black-box models. Our findings expose the illusion of CoT robustness and underscore the need for future architectures that enforce genuine answer-reasoning consistency rather than mere surface-level accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.17406v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Position: The Real Barrier to LLM Agent Usability is Agentic ROI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17767</link><description>arXiv:2505.17767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents represent a promising shift in human-AI interaction, moving beyond passive prompt-response systems to autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and goal-directed action. While LLM agents are technically capable of performing a broad range of tasks, not all of these capabilities translate into meaningful usability. This position paper argues that the central question for LLM agent usability is no longer whether a task can be automated, but whether it delivers sufficient Agentic Return on Investment (Agentic ROI). Agentic ROI reframes evaluation from raw performance to a holistic, utility-driven perspective, guiding when, where, and for whom LLM agents should be deployed. Despite widespread application in high-ROI tasks like coding and scientific research, we identify a critical usability gap in mass-market, everyday applications. To address this, we propose a zigzag developmental trajectory: first scaling up to improve information gain and time savings, then scaling down to reduce cost. We present a strategic roadmap across these phases to make LLM agents truly usable, accessible, and scalable in real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.17767v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LookWhere?

Abstract: Vision transformers are ever larger, more accurate, and more expensive to compute. The expense is even more extreme at high resolution as the number of tokens grows quadratically with the image size. We turn to adaptive computation to cope with this cost by learning to predict where to compute. Our LookWhere method divides the computation between a low-resolution selector and a high-resolution extractor without ever processing the full high-resolution input. We jointly pretrain the selector and extractor without task supervision by distillation from a self-supervised teacher, in effect, learning where and what to compute simultaneously. Unlike prior token reduction methods, which pay to save by pruning already-computed tokens, and prior token selection methods, which require complex and expensive per-task optimization, LookWhere economically and accurately selects and extracts transferrable representations of images. We show that LookWhere excels at sparse recognition on high-resolution inputs (Traffic Signs), maintaining accuracy while reducing FLOPs by up to 34x and time by 6x. It also excels at standard recognition tasks that are global (ImageNet classification) or local (ADE20K segmentation), improving accuracy while reducing time by 1.36x.

Abstract: Achieving differential privacy (DP) guarantees in fully decentralized machine learning is challenging due to the absence of a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. We present a framework for DP analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging algorithms with additive node-level noise, from arbitrary views of nodes in a graph. We present an analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately characterizes privacy leakage between nodes. Our main contribution is showing that the DP guarantees are those of a Gaussian mechanism, where the growth of the squared sensitivity is asymptotically $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of training rounds, similarly as in the case of central aggregation. As an application of the sensitivity analysis, we show that the excess risk of decentralized private learning for strongly convex losses is asymptotically similar as in centralized private learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.19969v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SelfReflect: Can LLMs Communicate Their Internal Answer Distribution?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20295</link><description>arXiv:2505.20295v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The common approach to communicate a large language model's (LLM) uncertainty is to add a percentage number or a hedging word to its response. But is this all we can do? Instead of generating a single answer and then hedging it, an LLM that is fully transparent to the user needs to be able to reflect on its internal belief distribution and output a summary of all options it deems possible, and how likely they are. To test whether LLMs possess this capability, we develop the SelfReflect metric, an information-theoretic distance between a given summary and a distribution over answers. In interventional and human studies, we find that SelfReflect indicates even slight deviations, yielding a fine measure of faithfulness between a summary string and an LLM's actual internal distribution over answers. With SelfReflect, we make a resounding negative observation: modern LLMs are, across the board, incapable of revealing what they are uncertain about, neither through reasoning, nor chains-of-thoughts, nor explicit finetuning. However, we do find that LLMs are able to generate faithful summaries of their uncertainties if we help them by sampling multiple outputs and feeding them back into the context. This simple approach shines a light at the universal way of communicating LLM uncertainties whose future development the SelfReflect score enables. To support the development of this universal form of LLM uncertainties, we publish the code that implements our metric for arbitrary LLMs under https://github.com/apple/ml-selfreflect .</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.20295v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] POLAR: A Benchmark for Multilingual, Multicultural, and Multi-Event Online Polarization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20624</link><description>arXiv:2505.20624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online polarization poses a growing challenge for democratic discourse, yet most computational social science research remains monolingual, culturally narrow, or event-specific. We introduce POLAR, a multilingual, multicultural, and multi-event dataset with over 110K instances in 22 languages drawn from diverse online platforms and real-world events. Polarization is annotated along three axes, namely detection, type, and manifestation, using a variety of annotation platforms adapted to each cultural context. We conduct two main experiments: (1) fine-tuning six pretrained small language models; and (2) evaluating a range of open and closed large language models in few-shot and zero-shot settings. The results show that, while most models perform well in binary polarization detection, they achieve substantially lower performance when predicting polarization types and manifestations. These findings highlight the complex, highly contextual nature of polarization and demonstrate the need for robust, adaptable approaches in NLP and computational social science. All resources will be released to support further research and effective mitigation of digital polarization globally.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.20624v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Multi-Modal Learning from Gradient Uncertainty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23071</link><description>arXiv:2505.23071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Modal Learning (MML) integrates information from diverse modalities to improve predictive accuracy. While existing optimization strategies have made significant strides by mitigating gradient direction conflicts, we revisit MML from a gradient-based perspective to explore further improvements. Empirically, we observe an interesting phenomenon: performance fluctuations can persist in both conflict and non-conflict settings. Based on this, we argue that: beyond gradient direction, the intrinsic reliability of gradients acts as a decisive factor in optimization, necessitating the explicit modeling of gradient uncertainty. Guided by this insight, we propose Bayesian-Oriented Gradient Calibration for MML (BOGC-MML). Our approach explicitly models gradients as probability distributions to capture uncertainty, interpreting their precision as evidence within the framework of subjective logic and evidence theory. By subsequently aggregating these signals using a reduced Dempster's combination rule, BOGC-MML adaptively weights gradients based on their reliability to generate a calibrated update. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.23071v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are Your Generated Instances Truly Useful?

Abstract: The proliferation of machine learning-based methods for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) instance generation has surged, driven by the need for diverse training datasets. However, a critical question remains: Are these generated instances truly useful and realistic? Current evaluation protocols often rely on superficial structural metrics or simple solvability checks, which frequently fail to capture the true computational complexity of real-world problems. To bridge this gap, we introduce GenBench-MILP, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed for the standardized and objective evaluation of MILP generators. Our framework assesses instance quality across four key dimensions: mathematical validity, structural similarity, computational hardness, and utility in downstream tasks. A distinctive innovation of GenBench-MILP is the analysis of solver-internal features -- including root node gaps, heuristic success rates, and cut plane usage. By treating the solver's dynamic behavior as an expert assessment, we reveal nuanced computational discrepancies that static graph features miss. Our experiments on instance generative models demonstrate that instances with high structural similarity scores can still exhibit drastically divergent solver interactions and difficulty levels. By providing this multifaceted evaluation toolkit, GenBench-MILP aims to facilitate rigorous comparisons and guide the development of high-fidelity instance generators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.24779v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Many-for-Many: Unify the Training of Multiple Video and Image Generation and Manipulation Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01758</link><description>arXiv:2506.01758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many visual generation and manipulation tasks. Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines.

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims at optimising several, often conflicting goals to improve the flexibility and reliability of RL in practical tasks. This is typically achieved by finding a set of diverse, non-dominated policies that form a Pareto front in the performance space. We introduce LLE-MORL, an approach that achieves interpretability by design by utilising a training scheme based on the local relationship between the parameter space and the performance space. By exploiting a locally linear map between these spaces, our method provides an interpretation of policy parameters in terms of the objectives, and this structured representation enables an efficient search within contiguous solution domains, allowing for the rapid generation of high-quality solutions without extensive retraining. Experiments across diverse continuous control domains demonstrate that LLE-MORL consistently achieves higher Pareto front quality and efficiency than state-of-the-art approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04022v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Statistically Valid Post-Deployment Monitoring Should Be Standard for AI-Based Digital Health</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05701</link><description>arXiv:2506.05701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is underdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing frameworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in real-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We contend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative to current practices. We use the term "statistically valid" to refer to methods that provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable formal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support reproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements. Specifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis testing problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of clinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the technical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically principled detection, attribution, and mitigation of post-deployment model failures in real-world settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.05701v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GIQ: Benchmarking 3D Geometric Reasoning of Vision Foundation Models with Simulated and Real Polyhedra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08194</link><description>arXiv:2506.08194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet recent works cast doubt on their true understanding of geometric properties. We introduce GOQ, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ comprises synthetic and real-world images and corresponding 3D meshes of diverse polyhedra covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry, from Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids to stellations and compound shapes. Through systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to reconstruct even basic geometric Platonic solids accurately. Next, although foundation models may be shown via linear and non-linear probing to capture specific 3D symmetry elements, they falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claud exhibit remarkably low accuracy in interpreting basic shape properties such as face geometry, convexity, and compound structures of complex polyhedra. GIQ is publicly available at toomanymatts.github.io/giq-benchmark/, providing a structured platform to benchmark critical gaps in geometric intelligence and facilitate future progress in robust, geometry-aware representation learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.08194v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automatic differentiation for performing the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure in Lax-Wendroff type discretizations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11719</link><description>arXiv:2506.11719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lax-Wendroff methods combined with discontinuous Galerkin/flux reconstruction spatial discretization provide a high-order, single-stage, quadrature-free method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. In this work, we introduce automatic differentiation (AD) for performing the Cauchy-Kowalewski procedure used in the element-local time average flux computation step (the predictor step) of Lax-Wendroff methods. The application of AD is similar for methods of any order and does not need positivity corrections during the predictor step. This contrasts with the approximate Lax-Wendroff procedure, which requires different finite difference formulas for different orders of the method and positivity corrections in the predictor step for fluxes that can only be computed on admissible states. The method is Jacobian-free and problem-independent, allowing direct application to any physical flux function. Numerical experiments demonstrate the order and positivity preservation of the method. Additionally, performance comparisons indicate that the wall-clock time of automatic differentiation is always on par with the approximate Lax-Wendroff method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.11719v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Faithful to What?"

Abstract: In explainable AI, surrogate models are commonly evaluated by their fidelity to a neural network's predictions. Fidelity, however, measures alignment to a learned model rather than alignment to the data-generating signal underlying the task. This work introduces the linearity score $\lambda(f)$, a diagnostic that quantifies the extent to which a regression network's input--output behavior is linearly decodable. $\lambda(f)$ is defined as an $R^2$ measure of surrogate fit to the network. Across synthetic and real-world regression datasets, we find that surrogates can achieve high fidelity to a neural network while failing to recover the predictive gains that distinguish the network from simpler models. In several cases, high-fidelity surrogates underperform even linear baselines trained directly on the data. These results demonstrate that explaining a model's behavior is not equivalent to explaining the task-relevant structure of the data, highlighting a limitation of fidelity-based explanations when used to reason about predictive performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.12176v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalizable Trajectory Prediction via Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Mamba-Graph Architecture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12474</link><description>arXiv:2506.12474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate driving behavior modeling is fundamental to safe and efficient trajectory prediction, yet remains challenging in complex traffic scenarios. This paper presents a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that captures human-like decision-making by inferring diverse reward functions, enabling robust cross-scenario adaptability. The learned reward function is utilized to maximize the likelihood of output by integrating Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence dependency modeling with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among traffic agents.

Abstract: Fact verification is essential for ensuring the reliability of LLM applications. In this study, we evaluate 12 pre-trained LLMs and one specialized fact-verifier, including frontier LLMs and open-weight reasoning LLMs, using a collection of examples from 14 fact-checking benchmarks. We share three findings intended to guide future development of more robust fact verifiers. First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors and ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\% of ambiguous or incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting this issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations, and we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help identify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with few-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve top-tier performance. We therefore recommend that future studies include comparisons with these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their effectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the development of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small models still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require complex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with synthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in such instances.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is frequently hindered by prohibitive memory and computational requirements. While quantization mitigates these bottlenecks, maintaining model fidelity in the sub-1-bit regime remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we introduce LittleBit, a novel framework for extreme LLM compression. We target quantization rates as low as $0.1$ bits per weight (BPW), achieving a memory reduction of approximately $31\times$, which effectively compresses Llama2-13B to under $0.9$ GB. We represent weights via low-rank latent matrix factorization and subsequently binarize the resulting factors. To counteract the information loss inherent to such drastic precision reduction, we integrate a multi-scale compensation mechanism that learns importance parameters across row, column, and latent dimensions. Two primary contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and Residual Compensation to minimize approximation errors. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of LittleBit in the sub-1-bit domain; for instance, our method at $0.1$ BPW surpasses the performance of leading techniques operating at $0.7$ BPW on Llama2-7B. We establish a new size-performance trade-off -- unlocking a potential $11.6\times$ inference speedup relative to FP16 -- and render powerful LLMs practical for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards -- SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified -- have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (79 entries) and Verified (99 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 80 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.17208v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-Based Social Simulations Require a Boundary</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19806</link><description>arXiv:2506.19806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This position paper argues that LLM-based social simulations require clear boundaries to make meaningful contributions to social science. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating human behavior, their tendency to produce homogeneous outputs, acting as an "average persona", fundamentally limits their ability to capture the behavioral diversity essential for complex social dynamics. We examine why heterogeneity matters for social simulations and how current LLMs fall short, analyzing the relationship between mean alignment and variance in LLM-generated behaviors. Through a systematic review of representative studies, we find that validation practices often fail to match the heterogeneity requirements of research questions: while most papers include ground truth comparisons, fewer than half explicitly assess behavioral variance, and most that do report lower variance than human populations. We propose that researchers should: (1) match validation depth to the heterogeneity demands of their research questions, (2) explicitly report variance alongside mean alignment, and (3) constrain claims to collective-level qualitative patterns when variance is insufficient. Rather than dismissing LLM-based simulation, we advocate for a boundary-aware approach that ensures these methods contribute genuine insights to social science.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.19806v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Maximum Likelihood Estimation for System Identification of Networks of Dynamical Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20628</link><description>arXiv:2506.20628v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates maximum likelihood estimation for direct system identification in networks of dynamical systems. We establish that the proposed approach is both consistent and efficient. In addition, it is more generally applicable than existing methods, since it can be employed even when measurements are unavailable for all network nodes, provided that network identifiability is satisfied. Finally, we demonstrate that the maximum likelihood problem can be formulated without relying on a predictor, which is key to achieving computationally efficient numerical solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.20628v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AlphaBeta is not as good as you think: a simple class of synthetic games for a better analysis of deterministic game-solving algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21996</link><description>arXiv:2506.21996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis, revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's design: its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a class of synthetic games generated by a probabilistic model that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependencies, a critical structural feature of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to that of independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences: AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these methods under a richer, more challenging, and yet tractable model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.21996v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Thompson Sampling-Based Learning and Control for Unknown Dynamic Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22186</link><description>arXiv:2506.22186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a Bayesian randomized exploration strategy that samples options (e.g., system parameters or control laws) from the current posterior and then applies the selected option that is optimal for a task, thereby balancing exploration and exploitation; this makes TS effective for active learning-based controller design. However, TS relies on finite parametric representations, which limits its applicability to more general spaces, which are more commonly encountered in control system design. To address this issue, this work proposes a parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and designs a data-driven active learning control approach. Specifically, the proposed method treats the control law as an element in a function space, allowing the design of control laws without imposing restrictions on the system structure or the form of the controller. A TS framework is proposed in this work to reduce control costs through online exploration and exploitation, and the convergence guarantees are further provided for the learning process. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method learns the relationship between control laws and closed-loop performance metrics at an exponential rate, and the upper bound of control regret is also derived. Furthermore, the closed-loop stability of the proposed learning framework is analyzed. Numerical experiments on controlling unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.22186v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] STACK: Adversarial Attacks on LLM Safeguard Pipelines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24068</link><description>arXiv:2506.24068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic and OpenAI guard their latest Opus 4 model and GPT-5 models using such defense pipelines, and other frontier developers including Google DeepMind pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second, we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33% ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.24068v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dual Perspectives on Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01028</link><description>arXiv:2507.01028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\em stop gradient} and {\em exponential moving average} iterative procedures are commonly used in non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream applications in practice. This presentation investigates these procedures from the dual viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We show that, in general, although they {\em do not} optimize the original objective, or {\em any} other smooth function, they {\em do} avoid collapse Following~\citet{Tian21}, but without any of the extra assumptions used in their proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop gradient or exponential moving average {\em always} leads to collapse. Conversely, we characterize explicitly the equilibria of the dynamical systems associated with these two procedures in this linear setting as algebraic varieties in their parameter space, and show that they are, in general, {\em asymptotically stable}. Our theoretical findings are illustrated by empirical experiments with real and synthetic data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.01028v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Faber polynomials in a deltoid region and power iteration momentum methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01885</link><description>arXiv:2507.01885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a region in the complex plane enclosed by a deltoid curve inscribed in the unit circle, and define a family of polynomials $P_n$ that satisfy the same recurrence relation as the Faber polynomials for this region. We use this family of polynomials to give a constructive proof that $z^n$ is approximately a polynomial of degree $\sim\sqrt{n}$ within the deltoid region. Moreover, we show that $|P_n| \le 1$ in this deltoid region, and that, if $|z| = 1+\varepsilon$, then the magnitude $|P_n(z)|$ is at least $\frac{1}{3}(1+\sqrt{\varepsilon})^n$, for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. We illustrate our polynomial approximation theory with an application to iterative linear algebra. In particular, we construct a higher-order momentum-based method that accelerates the power iteration for certain matrices with complex eigenvalues. We show how the method can be run dynamically when the two dominant eigenvalues are real and positive.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.01885v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoSteer: Collaborative Decoding-Time Personalization via Local Delta Steering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04756</link><description>arXiv:2507.04756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalization has become crucial for adapting models to the diverse and evolving needs of users across cultural, temporal, and contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized fine-tuning or static preference alignment within a single model, they struggle to achieve both real-time and high-quality personalization under the resource and privacy constraints of personal devices. To address this challenge, we propose CoSteer, a collaborative framework that enables tuning-free, real-time personalization via decoding-time adaptation. By leveraging logit differences between context-aware and context-agnostic local small models, CoSteer steers cloud-based large models, ensuring effective personalization while preserving the large model's capabilities. Personalization is handled locally, with only final tokens sent to the cloud, maintaining both user context and system efficiency. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer generates high-quality personalized content, ensuring both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Our results highlight its robustness across models and environments, confirming its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.04756v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to summarize user information for personalized reinforcement learning from human feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13579</link><description>arXiv:2507.13579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it models the entire user population with a single reward model, meaning it assumes that everyone's preferences are the same. We present a novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to learn to produce text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. Both the user-summarization model and reward model are trained simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show that in contrast to the standard Bradley-Terry model, summaries produced by PLUS capture diverse aspects of user preferences, achieving a 11-77/% improvement in reward model accuracy. Key strengths of PLUS are: (1) robust performance with new users and conversation topics, achieving a 25\% improvement over the best personalized reward model technique used for RLHF; (2) zero-shot personalization with state-of-the-art proprietary models like GPT-4 (e.g., PLUS-summary-conditioned responses achieved a 72\% win rate compared to 28% for default GPT-4o); (3) learning from flexible user contexts beyond preference labels, and (4) interpretable representation of users, enabling greater transparency and user control in pluralistic LLM alignment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.13579v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feature Engineering is Not Dead: Reviving Classical Machine Learning with Entropy, HOG, and LBP Feature Fusion for Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13772</link><description>arXiv:2507.13772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns, diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image classification and computer vision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.13772v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning-Based Modeling of a Magnetically Steerable Soft Suction Device for Endoscopic Endonasal Interventions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15155</link><description>arXiv:2507.15155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a learning-based modeling framework for a magnetically steerable soft suction device designed for endoscopic endonasal brain tumor resection. The device is miniaturized (4 mm outer diameter, 2 mm inner diameter, 40 mm length), 3D printed using biocompatible SIL 30 material, and integrates embedded Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors for real-time shape feedback. Shape reconstruction is represented using four Bezier control points, providing a compact representation of deformation. A data-driven model was trained on 5,097 experimental samples to learn the mapping from magnetic field parameters (magnitude: 0-14 mT, frequency: 0.2-1.0 Hz, vertical tip distances: 90-100 mm) to Bezier control points defining the robot's 3D shape. Both Neural Network (NN) and Random Forest (RF) architectures were compared. The RF model outperformed the NN, achieving a mean RMSE of 0.087 mm in control point prediction and 0.064 mm in shape reconstruction error. Feature importance analysis revealed that magnetic field components predominantly influence distal control points, while frequency and distance affect the base configuration. Unlike prior studies applying general machine learning to soft robotic data, this framework introduces a new paradigm linking magnetic actuation inputs directly to geometric Bezier control points, creating an interpretable, low-dimensional deformation representation. This integration of magnetic field characterization, embedded FBG sensing, and Bezier-based learning provides a unified strategy extensible to other magnetically actuated continuum robots. By enabling sub-millimeter shape prediction and real-time inference, this work advances intelligent control of magnetically actuated soft robotic tools in minimally invasive neurosurgery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.15155v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Code Clone Detection via an AlphaFold-Inspired Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15226</link><description>arXiv:2507.15226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Code clone detection plays a critical role in software maintenance and vulnerability analysis. Substantial methods have been proposed to detect code clones. However, they struggle to extract high-level program semantics directly from a single linear token sequence, leading to unsatisfactory detection performance. A similar single-sequence challenge has been successfully addressed in protein structure prediction by AlphaFold. Motivated by the successful resolution of the shared single-sequence challenge by AlphaFold, as well as the sequential similarities between proteins and code, we leverage AlphaFold for code clone detection. In particular, we propose AlphaCC, which represents code fragments as token sequences and adapts AlphaFold's sequence-to-structure modeling capability to infer code semantics. The pipeline of AlphaCC goes through three steps. First, AlphaCC transforms each input code fragment into a token sequence and, motivated by AlphaFold's use of multiple sequence alignment (MSA), novelly uses a retrieval-augmentation strategy to construct an MSA from lexically similar token sequences. Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified attention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and across token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure prediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences through a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to determine code clone pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on three datasets, particularly two semantic clone detection datasets, show that AlphaCC consistently outperforms all baselines, demonstrating strong semantic understanding. AlphaCC further achieves strong performance on instances where tool-dependent methods fail, highlighting its tool-independence. Moreover, AlphaCC maintains competitive efficiency, enabling practical usage in large-scale clone detection tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.15226v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Should Bias be Eliminated? A General Framework to Use Bias for OOD Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17001</link><description>arXiv:2507.17001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most approaches to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization learn domain-invariant representations by discarding contextual bias. In this paper, we raise a critical question: Should bias be eliminated? If not, is there a general way to leverage bias for better OOD generalization? To answer these questions, we first provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes the circumstances in which biased features contribute positively. Although theoretical results show that bias may sometimes play a positive role, leveraging it effectively is non-trivial, since its harmful and beneficial components are often entangled. Recent advances have sought to refine the prediction of bias by presuming reliable predictions from invariant features. However, such assumptions may be too strong in the real world, especially when the target also shifts from training to testing domains. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce a framework to leverage bias in a more general scenario. Specifically, we employ a generative model to capture the data generation process and identify the underlying bias factors, which are then used to construct a bias-aware predictor. Since the bias-aware predictor may shift across environments, we first estimate the environment state to train predictors under different environments, combining them as a mixture of domain experts for the final prediction. Then, we build a general invariant predictor, which can be invariant under label shift to guide the adaptation of the bias-aware predictor. Evaluations on synthetic data and standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both invariance only baselines, recent bias utilization approaches and advanced baselines, yielding improved robustness and adaptability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.17001v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Personalized Safety Alignment for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01151</link><description>arXiv:2508.01151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, yet their deployment is hindered by a fundamental limitation: safety mechanisms enforce rigid, uniform standards that fail to reflect diverse user preferences shaped by age, culture, or personal beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework that transitions generative safety from static filtration to user-conditioned adaptation. We introduce Sage, a large-scale dataset capturing diverse safety boundaries across 1,000 simulated user profiles, covering complex risks often missed by traditional datasets. By integrating these profiles via a parameter-efficient cross-attention adapter, PSA dynamically modulates generation to align with individual sensitivities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSA achieves a calibrated safety-quality trade-off: under permissive profiles, it relaxes over-cautious constraints to enhance visual fidelity, while under restrictive profiles, it enforces state-of-the-art suppression, significantly outperforming static baselines. Furthermore, PSA exhibits superior instruction adherence compared to prompt-engineering methods, establishing personalization as a vital direction for creating adaptive, user-centered, and responsible generative AI. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/M-E-AGI-Lab/PSAlign.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.01151v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Context Adaptation for Consistent Role-Playing Agents with Retrieval-Augmented Generations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02016</link><description>arXiv:2508.02016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building role-playing agents (RPAs) that faithfully emulate specific characters remains challenging because collecting character-specific utterances and continually updating model parameters are resource-intensive, making retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) a practical necessity. However, despite the importance of RAG, there has been little research on RAG-based RPAs. For example, we empirically find that when a persona lacks knowledge relevant to a given query, RAG-based RPAs are prone to hallucination, making it challenging to generate accurate responses. In this paper, we propose Amadeus, a training-free framework that can significantly enhance persona consistency even when responding to questions that lie beyond a character's knowledge. In addition, to underpin the development and rigorous evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we manually construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question-answer pairs. We find that our proposed method effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by characters, but also various attributes such as personality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.02016v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CellForge: Agentic Design of Virtual Cell Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02276</link><description>arXiv:2508.02276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual cell modeling aims to predict cellular responses to diverse perturbations but faces challenges from biological complexity, multimodal data heterogeneity, and the need for interdisciplinary expertise. We introduce CellForge, a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and synthesizes neural network architectures tailored to specific single-cell datasets and perturbation tasks. Given raw multi-omics data and task descriptions, CellForge discovers candidate architectures through collaborative reasoning among specialized agents, then generates executable implementations. Our core contribution is the framework itself: showing that multi-agent collaboration mechanisms - rather than manual human design or single-LLM prompting - can autonomously produce executable, high-quality computational methods. This approach goes beyond conventional hyperparameter tuning by enabling entirely new architectural components such as trajectory-aware encoders and perturbation diffusion modules to emerge from agentic deliberation. We evaluate CellForge on six datasets spanning gene knockouts, drug treatments, and cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, CITE-seq). The results demonstrate that the models generated by CellForge are highly competitive with established baselines, while revealing systematic patterns of architectural innovation. CellForge highlights the scientific value of multi-agent frameworks: collaboration among specialized agents enables genuine methodological innovation and executable solutions that single agents or human experts cannot achieve. This represents a paradigm shift toward autonomous scientific method development in computational biology.

Abstract: Human manipulation skills represent a pinnacle of their voluntary motor functions, requiring the coordination of many degrees of freedom and processing of high-dimensional sensor input to achieve such a high level of dexterity. Thus, we attempt to answer whether the human hand, with its associated biomechanical properties, sensors, and control mechanisms, is an ideal that we should strive for in robotics-do we really need anthropomorphic robotic hands? This survey can help practitioners to make the trade-off between hand complexity and potential manipulation skills. We provide an overview of the human hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic hands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are capable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement for mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is missing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity? Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for robotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are often more important for manipulation capabilities. Increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or degrees of freedom is not always necessary. Three fingers often are a good compromise between simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two opposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase dexterity, suggesting that the human hand is not the optimum. Consequently, we argue for function-based rather than form-based biomimicry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05415v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative AI for Intent-Driven Network Management in 6G RAN: A Case Study on the Mamba Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06616</link><description>arXiv:2508.06616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of 6G, mobile networks are becoming increasingly heterogeneous and dynamic, necessitating advanced automation for efficient management. Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) address this by translating high-level intents into optimization policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance this process by understanding complex human instructions, enabling adaptive and intelligent automation. Given the rapid advancements in Generative AI (GenAI), a comprehensive survey of LLM-based IDN architectures in disaggregated Radio Access Network (RAN) environments is both timely and critical. This article provides such a survey, along with a case study on a selective State-Space Model (SSM)-enabled IDN architecture that integrates GenAI across three key stages: intent processing, intent validation, and intent execution. For the first time in the literature, we propose a hierarchical framework built on Mamba-SSM that introduces GenAI across all stages of the IDN pipeline. We further present a case study demonstrating that the proposed Mamba architecture significantly improves network performance through intelligent automation, surpassing existing IDN approaches. In a multi-cell 5G/6G scenario, the proposed architecture reduces quality of service drift by up to 70%, improves throughput by up to 80 Mbps, and lowers inference time to 60-70 ms, outperforming GenAI, reinforcement learning, and non-machine learning baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.06616v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840</link><description>arXiv:2508.12840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.12840v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Sliced Learning Framework for Online Disturbance Identification in Quadrotor SO(3) Attitude Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14422</link><description>arXiv:2508.14422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dimension-decomposed geometric learning framework called Sliced Learning for disturbance identification in quadrotor geometric attitude control. Instead of conventional learning-from-states, this framework adopts a learning-from-error strategy by using the Lie-algebraic error representation as the input feature, enabling axis-wise space decomposition (``slicing") while preserving the SO(3) structure. This is highly consistent with the geometric mechanism of cognitive control observed in neuroscience, where neural systems organize adaptive representations within structured subspaces to enable cognitive flexibility and efficiency. Based on this framework, we develop a lightweight and structurally interpretable Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM) module. The high-dimensional mapping for online identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings (``slices"), implemented by shallow neural networks and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation within their respective shared subspaces. To enhance interpretability, we prove exponential convergence despite time-varying disturbances and inertia uncertainties. To our knowledge, Sliced Learning is among the first frameworks to demonstrate lightweight online neural adaptation at 400 Hz on resource-constrained microcontroller units (MCUs), such as STM32, with real-world experimental validation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.14422v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Amortized Sampling with Transferable Normalizing Flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18175</link><description>arXiv:2508.18175v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in full for each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has inspired interest towards overcoming this limitation through learning sampling algorithms. Despite performing competitively with conventional methods when trained on a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to transfer across systems. We demonstrate that deep learning enables the design of scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 285 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems, achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length, whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows. Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance sampling-based fine-tuning procedure to achieve competitive performance to established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo. We open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and objectives.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.18175v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privacy-Preserving Distributed Control for a Networked Battery Energy Storage System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19345</link><description>arXiv:2508.19345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of distributed Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) in modern power grids necessitates effective coordination strategies to ensure state-of-charge (SoC) balancing and accurate power delivery. While distributed control frameworks offer scalability and resilience, they also raise significant privacy concerns due to the need for inter-agent information exchange. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving distributed control algorithm for SoC balancing in a networked BESS. The proposed framework includes distributed power allocation law that is designed based on two privacy-preserving distributed estimators, one for the average unit state and the other for the average desired power. The average unit state estimator is designed via the state decomposition method without disclosing sensitive internal states. The proposed power allocation law based on these estimators ensures asymptotic SoC balancing and global power delivery while safeguarding agent privacy from external eavesdroppers. The effectiveness and privacy-preserving properties of the proposed control strategy are demonstrated through simulation results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19345v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Symplectic convolutional neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19842</link><description>arXiv:2508.19842v2 Announce Type: replace

To construct a complete autoencoder, we introduce a symplectic pooling layer. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed neural network on three examples: the wave equation, the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, and the sine-Gordon equation. The numerical results indicate that the symplectic CNN outperforms the linear symplectic autoencoder obtained via proper symplectic decomposition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19842v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Sketch-and-Project Analysis of Subsampled Natural Gradient Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21022</link><description>arXiv:2508.21022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNG) has been used to enable high-precision scientific machine learning, but standard analyses based on stochastic preconditioning fail to provide insight into realistic small-sample settings. We overcome this limitation by instead analyzing SNG as a sketch-and-project method. Motivated by this lens, we discard the usual theoretical proxy which decouples gradients and preconditioners using two independent mini-batches, and we replace it with a new proxy based on squared volume sampling. Under this new proxy we show that the expectation of the SNG direction becomes equal to a preconditioned gradient descent step even in the presence of coupling, leading to (i) global convergence guarantees when using a single mini-batch of any size, and (ii) an explicit characterization of the convergence rate in terms of quantities related to the sketch-and-project structure. These findings in turn yield new insights into small-sample settings, for example by suggesting that the advantage of SNG over SGD is that it can more effectively exploit spectral decay in the model Jacobian. We also extend these ideas to explain a popular structured momentum scheme for SNG, known as SPRING, by showing that it arises naturally from accelerated sketch-and-project methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.21022v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language Models and Logic Programs for Trustworthy Tax Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21051</link><description>arXiv:2508.21051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ``the average American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability, making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying semantic parsing methods to statutory reasoning, and show promising economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures for increasing access to reliable tax assistance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.21051v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Calibration and Transformation-Free Weight-Only LLMs Quantization via Dynamic Grouping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03054</link><description>arXiv:2509.03054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but are difficult to deploy under tight memory and compute constraints. Low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising direction; however, it typically relies on calibration data, auxiliary transformations, and GPU tools. To address these limitations, we propose MSB (Multi Scale Binary), a calibration-free and transformation-free PTQ method that generalizes binary quantization to multi-bit settings. MSB optimizes a dynamic grouping criterion that minimizes within group variance, yielding group-wise multiscale levels that can be applied consistently across granularities from per tensor to block-wise configurations with 64 elements groups per row, without calibration or intermediate transforms. We implement the optimization in a CPU based solver for the quantization step and evaluate using standard bfloat16 execution without low-bit packing. On Llama 3.2 3B, MSB achieves 8.43 perplexity on WikiText-2 under 4-bit weight only block-wise quantization, compared to 7.81 in full precision and 12.23 with GPTQ its default setup. Overall, MSB provides a new optimization perspective for low-bit PTQ while simplifying the pipeline by removing calibration and transformations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.03054v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03493</link><description>arXiv:2509.03493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.03493v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531</link><description>arXiv:2509.03531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach targets entity-level hallucinations-e.g., fabricated names, dates, citations-rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering settings. Despite being trained only to detect hallucinated entities, our probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks, indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.03531v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Flexible inference for animal learning rules using neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04661</link><description>arXiv:2509.04661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial intelligence. However, existing approaches tend to assume fixed parametric forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient), which may not accurately describe the complex forms of learning employed by animals in realistic settings. Here we address this gap by developing a framework to infer learning rules directly from behavioral data collected during de novo task learning. We assume that animals follow a decision policy parameterized by a generalized linear model (GLM), and we model their learning rule -- the mapping from task covariates to per-trial weight updates -- using a deep neural network (DNN). This formulation allows flexible, data-driven inference of learning rules while maintaining an interpretable form of the decision policy itself. To capture more complex learning dynamics, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) variant that relaxes the Markovian assumption that learning depends solely on covariates of the current trial, allowing for learning rules that integrate information over multiple trials. Simulations demonstrate that the framework can recover ground-truth learning rules. We applied our DNN and RNN-based methods to a large behavioral dataset from mice learning to perform a sensory decision-making task and found that they outperformed traditional RL learning rules at predicting the learning trajectories of held-out mice. The inferred learning rules exhibited reward-history-dependent learning dynamics, with larger updates following sequences of rewarded trials. Overall, these methods provide a flexible framework for inferring learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks, setting the stage for improved animal training protocols and the development of behavioral digital twins.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.04661v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On optimal solutions of classical and sliced Wasserstein GANs with non-Gaussian data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06505</link><description>arXiv:2509.06505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been widely applied in reinforcement and semi-supervised learning as well as computer vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search, and only a few selection methods have been proven to be theoretically optimal. One of the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on optimal parameters for population WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) setting, where the generator NN is linear, and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of optimal solutions of population WGAN beyond the LQG setting. As a basic result, closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGAN are derived when the NN has non-linear activation functions, and the data is non-Gaussian. For high-dimensional data, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein framework and show that the linear generator can be asymptotically optimal. Moreover, the original sliced WGAN only constrains the projected data marginal instead of the whole one in classical WGAN, and thus, we propose another new unprojected sliced WGAN and identify its asymptotic optimality. Empirical studies show that compared to the celebrated r-principal component analysis (r-PCA) solution, which has cubic complexity to the data dimension, our generator for sliced WGAN can achieve better performance with only linear complexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06505v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BioLite U-Net: Edge-Deployable Semantic Segmentation for In Situ Bioprinting Monitoring</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06690</link><description>arXiv:2509.06690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process, labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score, and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85% and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame, demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines, BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent, closed-loop bioprinting systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06690v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SurgLaVi: Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Surgical Vision-Language Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10555</link><description>arXiv:2509.10555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However, progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets. In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from more than 200 procedures, and featuring hierarchical levels at coarse-, mid-, and fine-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-$\b{eta}$, an open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP datasets. To demonstrate the value of the SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP, a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale, semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.10555v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Living with Data: Exploring Physicalization Approaches to Sedentary Behavior Intervention for Older Adults in Everyday Life</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11059</link><description>arXiv:2509.11059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sedentary behavior is a critical health risk for older adults. Although digital interventions are widely available, they primarily rely on screen-based notifications that can feel clinical or cognitively demanding, and are thus often ignored over time. This paper presents a three-phase Research through Design methodology to explore data physicalization approaches that ambiently represent sedentary data patterns using decor artifacts in older adults' homes. These artifacts transformed abstract data into aesthetic, evolving forms that became part of the domestic landscape. Our research revealed how these physicalizations fostered self-reflection, family conversations, and encouraged active lifestyles. We demonstrate how qualities like aesthetic ambiguity and slow revelation can empower older adults, fostering a reflective relationship with their well-being. Ultimately, we argue that creating data physicalizations for older adults necessitates a shift from merely informing users to enabling them to live with and through their data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11059v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Are Two RLHF Objectives the Same?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11298</link><description>arXiv:2509.11298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preference optimization literature contains many proposed objectives, often presented as distinct improvements. We introduce Opal, a canonicalization algorithm that determines whether two preference objectives are algebraically equivalent by producing either a canonical form or a concrete witness of non-equivalence. Applying Opal reveals that many widely used methods optimize the same underlying objective, while others are provably distinct. For example, batch normalization can cause the same response pair to receive different gradients depending on batch composition. We identify a small set of structural mechanisms that give rise to genuinely different objectives; most remaining differences are reparameterizations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11298v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vistoria: A Multimodal System to Support Fictional Story Writing through Instrumental Text-Image Co-Editing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13646</link><description>arXiv:2509.13646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans think visually-we remember in images, dream in pictures, and use visual metaphors to communicate. Yet, most creative writing tools remain text-centric, limiting how authors plan and translate ideas. We present Vistoria, a system for synchronized text-image co-editing in fictional story writing that treats visuals and text as coequal narrative materials. A formative Wizard-of-Oz co-design study with 10 story writers revealed how sketches, images, and annotations serve as essential instruments for ideation and organization. Drawing on theories of Instrumental Interaction and Structural Mapping, Vistoria introduces multimodal operations-lasso, collage, filters, and perspective shifts that enable seamless narrative exploration across modalities. A controlled study with 12 participants shows that co-editing enhances expressiveness, immersion, and collaboration, enabling writers to explore divergent directions, embrace serendipitous randomness, and trace evolving storylines. While multimodality increased cognitive demand, participants reported stronger senses of authorship and agency. These findings demonstrate how multimodal co-editing expands creative potential by balancing abstraction and concreteness in narrative development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.13646v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TennisTV: Do Multimodal Large Language Models Understand Tennis Rallies?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15602</link><description>arXiv:2509.15602v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks from the stroke level to the rally level and includes 2527 human-verified questions. Evaluating 17 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.15602v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Patterns in the Transition From Founder-Leadership to Community Governance of Open Source</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16295</link><description>arXiv:2509.16295v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open digital public infrastructure needs community management to ensure accountability, sustainability, and robustness. Yet open-source projects often rely on centralized decision-making, and the determinants of successful community management remain unclear. We analyze 637 GitHub repositories to trace transitions from founder-led to shared governance. Specifically, we document trajectories to community governance by extracting institutional roles, actions, and deontic cues from version-controlled project constitutions GOVERNANCE .md. With a semantic parsing pipeline, we cluster elements into broader role and action types. We find roles and actions grow, and regulation becomes more balanced, reflecting increases in governance scope and differentiation over time. Rather than shifting tone, communities grow by layering and refining responsibilities. As transitions to community management mature, projects increasingly regulate ecosystem-level relationships and add definition to project oversight roles. Overall, this work offers a scalable pipeline for tracking the growth and development of community governance regimes from open-source software's familiar default of founder-ownership.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.16295v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling m-Sharpness Through the Structure of Stochastic Gradient Noise</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18001</link><description>arXiv:2509.18001v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has emerged as a highly effective technique to improve model generalization, but its underlying principles are not fully understood. We investigate m-sharpness, where SAM performance improves monotonically as the micro-batch size for computing perturbations decreases, a phenomenon critical for distributed training yet lacking rigorous explanation. We leverage an extended Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) framework and analyze stochastic gradient noise (SGN) to characterize the dynamics of SAM variants, including n-SAM and m-SAM. Our analysis reveals that stochastic perturbations induce an implicit variance-based sharpness regularization whose strength increases as m decreases. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reweighted SAM (RW-SAM), which employs sharpness-weighted sampling to mimic the generalization benefits of m-SAM while remaining parallelizable. Comprehensive experiments validate our theory and method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.18001v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TensLoRA: Tensor Alternatives for Low-Rank Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19391</link><description>arXiv:2509.19391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA under similar parameter counts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19391v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Summarize by Learning to Quiz: Adversarial Agentic Collaboration for Long Document Summarization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20900</link><description>arXiv:2509.20900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains: summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions, enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.20900v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer for Flight Trajectory Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21004</link><description>arXiv:2509.21004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows. However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21004v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal Robust Recourse with $L^p$-Bounded Model Change</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293</link><description>arXiv:2509.21293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment, invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models), most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm. However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21293v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sharpness-Aware Minimization Can Hallucinate Minimizers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21818</link><description>arXiv:2509.21818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is widely used to seek flatter minima -- often linked to better generalization. In its standard implementation, SAM updates the current iterate using the loss gradient evaluated at a point perturbed by distance $\rho$ along the normalized gradient direction. We show that, for some choices of $\rho$, SAM can stall at points where this shifted (perturbed-point) gradient vanishes despite a nonzero original gradient, and therefore, they are not stationary points of the original loss. We call these points hallucinated minimizers, prove their existence under simple nonconvex landscape conditions (e.g., the presence of a local minimizer and a local maximizer), and establish sufficient conditions for local convergence of the SAM iterates to them. We corroborate this failure mode in neural network training and observe that it aligns with SAM's performance degradation often seen at large $\rho$. Finally, as a practical safeguard, we find that a short initial SGD warm-start before enabling SAM mitigates this failure mode and reduces sensitivity to the choice of $\rho$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21818v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Customizing Visual Emotion Evaluation for MLLMs: An Open-vocabulary, Multifaceted, and Scalable Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21950</link><description>arXiv:2509.21950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps, underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/MVEI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21950v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SurvDiff: A Diffusion Model for Generating Synthetic Data in Survival Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22352</link><description>arXiv:2509.22352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death. Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff an end-to-end diffusion model specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis. SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii preserves the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that SurvDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both distributional fidelity and survival model evaluation metrics across multiple medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first end-to-end diffusion model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22352v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RefAM: Attention Magnets for Zero-Shot Referral Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22650</link><description>arXiv:2509.22650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile, large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information, making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise. Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video segmentation benchmarks, our approach achieves strong performance and surpasses prior methods on most datasets, establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning, additional components and complex reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22650v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Having Lunch Now": Understanding How Users Engage with a Proactive Agent for Daily Planning and Self-Reflection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24073</link><description>arXiv:2509.24073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational agents have been studied as tools to scaffold planning and self-reflection for productivity and well-being. While prior work has demonstrated positive outcomes, we still lack a clear understanding of what drives these results and how users behave and communicate with agents that act as coaches rather than assistants. Such understanding is critical for designing interactions in which agents foster meaningful behavioral change. We conducted a 14-day longitudinal study with 12 participants using a proactive agent that initiated regular check-ins to support daily planning and reflection. Our findings reveal diverse interaction patterns: participants accepted or negotiated suggestions, developed shared mental models, reported progress, and at times resisted or disengaged. We also identified problematic aspects of the agent's behavior, including rigidity, premature turn-taking, and overpromising. Our work contributes to understanding how people interact with a proactive, coach-like agent and offers design considerations for facilitating effective behavioral change.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24073v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why Tree-Style Branching Matters for Thought Advantage Estimation in GRPO</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24494</link><description>arXiv:2509.24494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) trains Chain-of-Thought reasoning with verifiable rewards, but estimating thought-level advantages without value functions often suffers from high variance. Although tree-style branching is used in practice to reduce the variance, it lacks a theoretical explanation of why it works and whether it is important or even potentially necessary. We study thought-level advantage estimation in GRPO from a variance perspective under a minimal tree-style setting where multiple answers are sampled for each thought. Using the multivariate delta method, we reveal an asymmetry in how different sampling dimensions affect variance. Increasing the number of sampled thoughts ($K$) leaves a strictly positive variance floor, whereas increasing the number of answers per thought ($M$) induces a monotonic decrease in variance, asymptotically decreasing it to zero. This implies that accurate thought-level advantage estimation is impossible through scaling thought sampling alone, making branching a potentially necessary mechanism rather than a heuristic. Experiments further provide empirical evidence for both the effectiveness and necessity of answer-level branching, demonstrating improved optimization stability, training efficiency, and final performance not only in math but also across a broad range of vision domains and under different model architectures and sizes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24494v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Informed Asymmetric Actor-Critic: Leveraging Privileged Signals Beyond Full-State Access</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26000</link><description>arXiv:2509.26000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetric actor-critic methods are widely used in partially observable reinforcement learning, but typically assume full state observability to condition the critic during training, which is often unrealistic in practice. We introduce the informed asymmetric actor-critic framework, allowing the critic to be conditioned on arbitrary state-dependent privileged signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that any such privileged signal yields unbiased policy gradient estimates, substantially expanding the set of admissible privileged information. This raises the problem of selecting the most adequate privileged information in order to improve learning. For this purpose, we propose two novel informativeness criteria: a dependence-based test that can be applied prior to training, and a criterion based on improvements in value prediction accuracy that can be applied post-hoc. Empirical results on partially observable benchmark tasks and synthetic environments demonstrate that carefully selected privileged signals can match or outperform full-state asymmetric baselines while relying on strictly less state information.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26000v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VibeCodeHPC: An Agent-Based Iterative Prompting Auto-Tuner for HPC Code Generation Using LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00031</link><description>arXiv:2510.00031v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting. Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order (gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer, such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g., gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.00761v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking the MoE LLM Trilemma: Dynamic Expert Clustering with Structured Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02345</link><description>arXiv:2510.02345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/szdtzpj/Breaking_the_moe_trilemma</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02345v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Controlling the Risk of Corrupted Contexts for Language Models via Early-Exiting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02480</link><description>arXiv:2510.02480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be influenced by harmful or irrelevant context, which can significantly harm model performance on downstream tasks. This motivates principled designs in which LLM systems include built-in mechanisms to guard against such ``garbage in, garbage out'' scenarios. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful context can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline ``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no context at all (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control (DFRC) to control the extent to which the user-provided context can decay performance below this safe zero-shot baseline. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction, ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs. Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk for harmful inputs and leverage performance and efficiency gains on helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results across 9 tasks spanning in-context learning and open-ended question answering, showing that our approach can effectively control risk for harmful context and simultaneously achieve substantial computational efficiency gains with helpful context.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02480v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Catastrophic is Your LLM? Certifying Risk in Conversation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03969</link><description>arXiv:2510.03969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce catastrophic responses in conversational settings that pose serious risks to public safety and security. Existing evaluations often fail to fully reveal these vulnerabilities because they rely on fixed attack prompt sequences, lack statistical guarantees, and do not scale to the vast space of multi-turn conversations. In this work, we propose C$^3$LLM, a novel, principled statistical Certification framework for Catastrophic risks in multi-turn Conversation for LLMs that bounds the probability of an LLM generating catastrophic responses under multi-turn conversation distributions with statistical guarantees. We model multi-turn conversations as probability distributions over query sequences, represented by a Markov process on a query graph whose edges encode semantic similarity to capture realistic conversational flow, and quantify catastrophic risks using confidence intervals. We define several inexpensive and practical distributions--random node, graph path, and adaptive with rejection. Our results demonstrate that these distributions can reveal substantial catastrophic risks in frontier models, with certified lower bounds as high as 70% for the worst model, highlighting the urgent need for improved safety training strategies in frontier LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03969v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LH-Deception: Simulating and Understanding LLM Deceptive Behaviors in Long-Horizon Interactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03999</link><description>arXiv:2510.03999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deception is a pervasive feature of human communication and an emerging concern in large language models (LLMs). While recent studies document instances of LLM deception, most evaluations remain confined to single-turn prompts and fail to capture the long-horizon interactions in which deceptive strategies typically unfold. We introduce a new simulation framework, LH-Deception, for a systematic, empirical quantification of deception in LLMs under extended sequences of interdependent tasks and dynamic contextual pressures. LH-Deception is designed as a multi-agent system: a performer agent tasked with completing tasks and a supervisor agent that evaluates progress, provides feedback, and maintains evolving states of trust. An independent deception auditor then reviews full trajectories to identify when and how deception occurs. We conduct extensive experiments across 11 frontier models, spanning both closed-source and open-source systems, and find that deception is model-dependent, increases with event pressure, and consistently erodes supervisor trust. Qualitative analyses further reveal emergent, long-horizon phenomena, such as ``chains of deception", which are invisible to static, single-turn evaluations. Our findings provide a foundation for evaluating future LLMs in real-world, trust-sensitive contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03999v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Attention-based Feature Memory Design for Energy-Efficient Continual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04660</link><description>arXiv:2510.04660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular data streams are increasingly prevalent in real-time decision-making across healthcare, finance, and the Internet of Things, often generated and processed on resource-constrained edge and mobile devices. Continual learning (CL) enables models to learn sequentially from such streams while retaining previously acquired knowledge. While recent CL advances have made significant progress in mitigating catastrophic forgetting, the energy and memory efficiency of CL for tabular data streams remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose AttenMLP, which integrates attention-based feature replay with context retrieval and sliding buffer updates within a minibatch training framework for streaming tabular learning.
  We evaluate AttenMLP against state-of-the-art (SOTA) tabular models on real-world concept drift benchmarks with temporal distribution shifts. Experimental results show that AttenMLP achieves accuracy comparable to strong baselines without replay, while substantially reducing energy consumption through tunable design choices. In particular, with the proposed attention-based feature memory design, AttenMLP costs a 0.062 decrease in final accuracy under the incremental concept drift dataset, while reducing energy usage up to 33.3\% compared to TabPFNv2. Under the abrupt concept drift dataset, AttenMLP reduces 1.47\% energy consumption compared to TabR, at the cost of a 0.038 decrease in final accuracy. Although ranking third in global efficiency, AttenMLP demonstrates energy-accuracy trade-offs across both abrupt and incremental concept drift scenarios compared to SOTA tabular models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04660v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-probability Convergence Guarantees of Decentralized SGD</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06141</link><description>arXiv:2510.06141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has attracted increasing interest, due to implying exponentially decaying tail bounds and strong guarantees for individual runs of an algorithm. While many works study HP guarantees in centralized settings, much less is understood in the decentralized setup, where existing works require strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise. This results in a significant gap between the assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the mean-squared error (MSE) sense, and is also contrary to centralized settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same conditions on the cost function as needed for MSE convergence. Motivated by these observations, we study the HP convergence of Decentralized $\mathtt{SGD}$ ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) in the presence of light-tailed noise, providing several strong results. First, we show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing the restrictive assumptions used in prior works. Second, our sharp analysis yields order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly convex costs. Third, we establish a linear speed-up in the number of users, leading to matching, or strictly better transient times than those obtained from MSE results, further underlining the tightness of our analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows $\mathtt{DSGD}$ achieves a linear speed-up in the HP sense. Our relaxed assumptions and sharp rates stem from several technical results of independent interest, including a result on the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense, as well as a novel bound on the MGF of strongly convex costs, which is of interest even in centralized settings. Finally, we provide experiments that validate our theory.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06141v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BACHI: Boundary-Aware Symbolic Chord Recognition Through Masked Iterative Decoding on Pop and Classical Music</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06528</link><description>arXiv:2510.06528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic chord recognition (ACR) via deep learning models has gradually achieved promising recognition accuracy, yet two key challenges remain. First, prior work has primarily focused on audio-domain ACR, while symbolic music (e.g., score) ACR has received limited attention due to data scarcity. Second, existing methods still overlook strategies that are aligned with human music analytical practices. To address these challenges, we make two contributions: (1) we introduce POP909-CL, an enhanced version of POP909 dataset with tempo-aligned content and human-corrected labels of chords, beats, keys, and time signatures; and (2) We propose BACHI, a symbolic chord recognition model that decomposes the task into different decision steps, namely boundary detection and iterative ranking of chord root, quality, and bass (inversion). This mechanism mirrors the human ear-training practices. Experiments demonstrate that BACHI achieves state-of-the-art chord recognition performance on both classical and pop music benchmarks, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each module.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06528v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VAO: Validation-Aligned Optimization for Cross-Task Generative Auto-Bidding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07760</link><description>arXiv:2510.07760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative auto-bidding has demonstrated strong performance in online advertising, yet it often suffers from data scarcity in small-scale settings with limited advertiser participation. While cross-task data sharing is a natural remedy to mitigate this issue, naive approaches often introduce gradient bias due to distribution shifts across different tasks, and existing methods are not readily applicable to generative auto-bidding. In this paper, we propose Validation-Aligned Optimization (VAO), a principled data-sharing method that adaptively reweights cross-task data contributions based on validation performance feedback. Notably, VAO aligns training dynamics to prioritize updates that improve generalization on the target task, effectively leveraging auxiliary data and mitigating gradient bias. Building on VAO, we introduce a unified generative autobidding framework that generalizes across multiple tasks using a single model and all available task data. Extensive experiments on standard auto-bidding benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07760v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging Whisper Embeddings for Audio-based Lyrics Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08176</link><description>arXiv:2510.08176v2 Announce Type: replace

Key innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing methods for neural-field filtering.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08394v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Compression for Coinductive Infinitary Rewriting: A Generic Approach, with Applications to Cut-Elimination for Non-Wellfounded Proofs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08420</link><description>arXiv:2510.08420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generic presentation of 'syntactic objects built by mixed induction and coinduction' encompassing all standard kinds of infinitary terms, as well as derivation trees in non-wellfounded proof systems. We then define a notion of coinductive rewriting of such objects, which is equivalent to the original presentation of infinitary rewriting relying on metric convergence and ordinal-indexed sequences of rewriting steps. This provides a unified coinductive presentation of e.g. first-order infinitary rewriting, infinitary \lambda-calculi, and cut-elimination in non-wellfounded proofs.
  We then formulate and study the coinductive counterpart of compression, i.e. the property of an infinitary rewriting system such that all rewriting sequences of any ordinal length can be 'compressed' to equivalent sequences of length at most \omega (which ensures that they can be finitely approximated). We characterise compression in our generic setting for coinductive rewriting, 'factorising' the part of the proof that can be performed at this level of generality. Our proof is fully coinductive, avoiding any detour via rewriting sequences.
  Finally we focus on the non-wellfounded proof system \muMALL\infty for multiplicative-additive linear logic with fixed points, and we put our results to work in order to prove that compression holds for cut-elimination in this setting, which is a key lemma of several extension of cut-elimination to similar systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08420v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RAG4Tickets: AI-Powered Ticket Resolution via Retrieval-Augmented Generation on JIRA and GitHub Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08667</link><description>arXiv:2510.08667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern software teams frequently encounter delays in resolving recurring or related issues due to fragmented knowledge scattered across JIRA tickets, developer discussions, and GitHub pull requests (PRs). To address this challenge, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that integrates Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings with FAISS-based vector search to deliver context-aware ticket resolution recommendations. The approach embeds historical JIRA tickets, user comments, and linked PR metadata to retrieve semantically similar past cases, which are then synthesized by a Large Language Model (LLM) into grounded and explainable resolution suggestions. The framework contributes a unified pipeline linking JIRA and GitHub data, an embedding and FAISS indexing strategy for heterogeneous software artifacts, and a resolution generation module guided by retrieved evidence. Experimental evaluation using precision, recall, resolution time reduction, and developer acceptance metrics shows that the proposed system significantly improves resolution accuracy, fix quality, and knowledge reuse in modern DevOps environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08667v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transmuting prompts into weights</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08734</link><description>arXiv:2510.08734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques, while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture. Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically mapped to token-dependent implicit weight updates (Dherin et. al, 2025), we derive a principled method for condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing vector-and-matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct, computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable weight updates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08734v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pattern Enhanced Multi-Turn Jailbreaking: Exploiting Structural Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08859</link><description>arXiv:2510.08859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints gradually. These attacks target different harm categories through distinct conversational approaches. Existing multi-turn methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation patterns to construct multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue. Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles, defense to one pattern does not generalize to others, and model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware defenses.

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on single-peaked preferences -- a well-established structure in social choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde O(U\sqrt{TK})$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.09425v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Group-Adaptive Adversarial Learning for Robust Fake News Detection Against Malicious Comments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09712</link><description>arXiv:2510.09712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online fake news profoundly distorts public judgment and erodes trust in social platforms. While existing detectors achieve competitive performance on benchmark datasets, they remain notably vulnerable to malicious comments designed specifically to induce misclassification. This evolving threat landscape necessitates detection systems that simultaneously prioritize predictive accuracy and structural robustness. However, current detectors often fail to generalize across diverse and novel comment attack patterns. To bridge this gap, we propose AdComment, an adaptive adversarial training framework for robustness enhancement against diverse malicious comments. Based on cognitive psychology, we categorize adversarial comments into Fact Distortion, Logical Confusion, and Emotional Manipulation, and leverage LLMs to synthesize diverse, category-specific perturbations. Central to our framework is an InfoDirichlet Resampling (IDR) mechanism that dynamically adjusts malicious comment proportions during training, thereby steering optimization toward the model's most susceptible regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, improving the F1 scores by 17.9%, 14.5% and 9.0%, respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.09712v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond touch-based human-machine interface: Control your machines in natural language by utilizing large language models and OPC UA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11300</link><description>arXiv:2510.11300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an agent-based approach toward a more natural interface between humans and machines. Large language models equipped with tools and the communication standard OPC UA are utilized to control machines in natural language. Instead of touch interaction, which is currently the state-of-the-art medium for interaction in operations, the proposed approach enables operators to talk or text with machines. This allows commands such as 'Please decrease the temperature by 20 % in machine 1 and start the cleaning operation in machine 2.' The large language model receives the user input and selects one of three predefined tools that connect to an OPC UA server and either change or read the value of a node. Afterwards, the result of the tool execution is passed back to the language model, which then provides a final response to the user. The approach is universally designed and can therefore be applied to any machine that supports the OPC UA standard. The large language model is neither fine-tuned nor requires training data, only the relevant machine credentials and a parameter dictionary are included within the system prompt. The tool-calling ability and their design is evaluated on a demonstrator setup with a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller with four machine parameters. Fifty synthetically generated commands on five different models were tested and the results demonstrate high success rate, with proprietary GPT-5 models achieving accuracies between 96.0 % and 98.0 %, and open-weight models reaching up to 90.0 %. Afterwards the approach was transferred to a deployed spay-coating machine. The proposed concept is supposed to contribute in advancing natural interaction in industrial human-machine interfaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11300v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TaskAudit: Detecting Functiona11ity Errors in Mobile Apps via Agentic Task Execution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12972</link><description>arXiv:2510.12972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accessibility checkers are tools in support of accessible app development, and their use is encouraged by accessibility best practices. However, most current checkers evaluate static or mechanically-generated contexts, failing to capture common accessibility errors impacting mobile app functionality. In this work, we define functiona11ity errors as accessibility barriers that only manifest through interaction (i.e., named according to a blend of "functionality" and "accessibility"). We introduce TaskAudit, which comprises three components: a Task Generator that constructs interactive tasks from app screens, a Task Executor that uses agents with a screen reader proxy to perform these tasks, and an Accessibility Analyzer that detects and reports accessibility errors by examining interaction traces. Our evaluation on real-world apps shows that TaskAudit detects 48 functiona11ity errors from 54 app screens, compared to between 4 and 20 with existing checkers. Our analysis demonstrates common error patterns that TaskAudit can detect in addition to those from prior work, including label-functionality mismatch, cluttered navigation, and inappropriate feedback.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.12972v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Progressive multi-fidelity learning with neural networks for physical system predictions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13762</link><description>arXiv:2510.13762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data. Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.13762v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding and Improving Length Generalization in Hierarchical Sparse Attention Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17196</link><description>arXiv:2510.17196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval; (2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17196v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Auto-Rubric: Learning From Implicit Weights to Explicit Rubrics for Reward Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17314</link><description>arXiv:2510.17314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional reward modeling relies on gradient descent over neural weights, creating opaque, data-hungry "black boxes." We propose a paradigm shift from implicit to explicit reward parameterization, recasting optimization from continuous weight spaces to the discrete space of natural language rubrics. We introduce a training-free framework based on iterative rubric learning: it locally induces discriminative criteria via verification-driven refinement, and globally compresses the candidate criteria pool into a compact core set by maximizing an information-theoretic coding rate objective. We organize the compressed core set into a hierarchical rubric structure -- high-level evaluation dimensions supported by concrete verification checks -- serving as an interpretable, portable reward function. Empirically, our approach challenges prevailing data scaling assumptions: using only 70 preference pairs, our rubric-guided judges outperform fully trained reward models on diverse benchmarks. For instance, Qwen3-8B equipped with our learned rubrics achieves 80.91% on RewardBench2, surpassing the specialized Skywork-Reward-V2-Qwen3-8B (78.20%). These results demonstrate that alignment signals are highly compressible and can be effectively captured through explicit symbolic search.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17314v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Preference-based Reinforcement Learning beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Benefits of Multiple Options</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18713</link><description>arXiv:2510.18713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024, Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably, the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm, which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}} \right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18713v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting with Robust Reconciliation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20383</link><description>arXiv:2510.20383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice, however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case average of weighted squared residuals over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.20383v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Additive Models Explained: A Computational Complexity Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21292</link><description>arXiv:2510.21292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable* within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations are possible or provably hard.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.21292v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepAgent: A General Reasoning Agent with Scalable Toolsets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21618</link><description>arXiv:2510.21618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities, yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows, which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. To manage long-horizon interactions, we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working, and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios.

Abstract: Contextual metadata is the unsung hero of research data. When done right, standardized and structured vocabularies make your data findable, shareable, and reusable. When done wrong, they turn a well intended effort into data cleanup and curation nightmares. In this paper we tackle the surprisingly tricky process of vocabulary standardization with a mix of practical advice and grounded examples. Drawing from real-world experience in contextual data harmonization, we highlight common challenges (e.g., semantic noise and concept bombs) and provide actionable strategies to address them. Our rules emphasize alignment with Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles while remaining adaptable to evolving user and research needs. Whether you are curating datasets, designing a schema, or contributing to a standards body, these rules aim to help you create metadata that is not only technically sound but also meaningful to users.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.21825v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differentiable Constraint-Based Causal Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22031</link><description>arXiv:2510.22031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions, and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches. Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores, obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes, surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available at https://github$.$com/PurdueMINDS/DAGPA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.22031v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PPE: Positional Preservation Embedding for Token Compression in Multimodal Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22936</link><description>arXiv:2510.22936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding (\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM reasoning.

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine \textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error (MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23868v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DEBATE: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Evaluating Opinion Dynamics in Role-Playing LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25110</link><description>arXiv:2510.25110v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for understanding and mitigating polarization, misinformation, and societal conflict. Recent work simulates opinion dynamics with role-playing LLM agents (RPLAs), but multi-agent simulations often display unnatural group behavior (e.g., premature convergence) and lack empirical benchmarks for assessing alignment with real human group interactions. We introduce DEBATE, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating the authenticity of opinion dynamics in multi-agent RPLA simulations. DEBATE contains 36,383 messages from 2,832 U.S.-based participants across 708 groups and 107 topics, with both public messages and private Likert-scale beliefs, enabling evaluation at the utterance and group levels (and supporting future individual-level analyses). We instantiate "digital twin" RPLAs with seven LLMs and evaluate across two settings: next-message prediction and full conversation rollout, using stance-alignment and opinion-convergence metrics. In zero-shot settings, RPLA groups exhibit strong opinion convergence relative to human groups. Post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improves stance alignment and brings group-level convergence closer to human behavior, though discrepancies in opinion change and belief updating remain. DEBATE enables rigorous benchmarking of simulated opinion dynamics and supports future research on aligning multi-agent RPLAs with realistic human interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25110v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TempoPFN: Synthetic Pre-training of Linear RNNs for Zero-shot Time Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25502</link><description>arXiv:2510.25502v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval, fev-bench and Chronos-ZS benchmarks, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference. We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code, providing a reproducible foundation for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25502v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Plan &amp; Schedule with Reinforcement-Learned Bimanual Robot Skills</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25634</link><description>arXiv:2510.25634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-horizon contact-rich bimanual manipulation presents a significant challenge, requiring complex coordination involving a mixture of parallel execution and sequential collaboration between arms. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical framework that frames this challenge as an integrated skill planning &amp; scheduling problem, going beyond purely sequential decision-making to support simultaneous skill invocation. Our approach is built upon a library of single-arm and bimanual primitive skills, each trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in GPU-accelerated simulation. We then train a Transformer-based planner on a dataset of skill compositions to act as a high-level scheduler, simultaneously predicting the discrete schedule of skills as well as their continuous parameters. We demonstrate that our method achieves higher success rates on complex, contact-rich tasks than end-to-end RL approaches and produces more efficient, coordinated behaviors than traditional sequential-only planners.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25634v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] All You Need for Object Detection: From Pixels, Points, and Prompts to Next-Gen Fusion and Multimodal LLMs/VLMs in Autonomous Vehicles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26641</link><description>arXiv:2510.26641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26641v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Remembering Unequally: Global and Disciplinary Bias in LLM Reconstruction of Scholarly Coauthor Lists</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00476</link><description>arXiv:2511.00476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) are reshaping scholarly search and discovery interfaces. While these systems offer new possibilities for navigating scientific knowledge, they also raise concerns about fairness and representational bias rooted in the models' memorized training data. As LLMs are increasingly used to answer queries about researchers and research communities, their ability to accurately reconstruct scholarly coauthor lists becomes an important but underexamined issue. In this study, we investigate how memorization in LLMs affects the reconstruction of coauthor lists and whether this process reflects existing inequalities across academic disciplines and world regions. We evaluate three prominent models, DeepSeek R1, Llama 4 Scout, and Mixtral 8x7B, by comparing their generated coauthor lists against bibliographic reference data. Our analysis reveals a systematic advantage for highly cited researchers, indicating that LLM memorization disproportionately favors already visible scholars. However, this pattern is not uniform: certain disciplines, such as Clinical Medicine, and some regions, including parts of Africa, exhibit more balanced reconstruction outcomes. These findings highlight both the risks and limitations of relying on LLM-generated relational knowledge in scholarly discovery contexts and emphasize the need for careful auditing of memorization-driven biases in LLM-based systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.00476v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Test-Time Iterative Error Correction for Efficient Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06250</link><description>arXiv:2511.06250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing demand for high-quality image generation on resource-constrained devices, efficient diffusion models have received increasing attention. However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.06250v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TabPFN-2.5: Advancing the State of the Art in Tabular Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08667</link><description>arXiv:2511.08667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (&lt;=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.08667v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data Heterogeneity and Forgotten Labels in Split Federated Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09736</link><description>arXiv:2511.09736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Split Federated Learning (SFL), the clients collaboratively train a model with the help of a server by splitting the model into two parts. Part-1 is trained locally at each client and aggregated by the aggregator at the end of each round. Part-2 is trained at a server that sequentially processes the intermediate activations received from each client. We study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in SFL in the presence of data heterogeneity. In detail, due to the nature of SFL, local updates of part-1 may drift away from global optima, while part-2 is sensitive to the processing sequence, similar to forgetting in continual learning (CL). Specifically, we observe that the trained model performs better in classes (labels) seen at the end of the sequence. We investigate this phenomenon with emphasis on key aspects of SFL, such as the processing order at the server and the cut layer. Based on our findings, we propose Hydra, a novel mitigation method inspired by multi-head neural networks and adapted for the SFL setting. Extensive numerical evaluations show that Hydra outperforms baselines and methods from the literature.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09736v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Text2SQL-Flow: A Robust SQL-Aware Data Augmentation Framework for Text-to-SQL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10192</link><description>arXiv:2511.10192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.10192v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VisMem: Latent Vision Memory Unlocks Potential of Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11007</link><description>arXiv:2511.11007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.0% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.11007v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Novel Stability Criteria for Discrete and Hybrid Systems via Ramanujan Inner Products</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13690</link><description>arXiv:2511.13690v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Recently, small models with latent recursion have obtained promising results on complex reasoning tasks. These results are typically explained by the theory that such recursion increases a networks depth, allowing it to compactly emulate the capacity of larger models. However, the performance of recursively added layers remains behind the capabilities of one pass models with the same feed forward depth. This means that in the looped version, not every recursive step effectively contributes to depth. This raises the question: when and why does latent reasoning improve performance, and when does it result in dead compute? In our work, we analyze the algorithms that latent reasoning provides answer to this question. We show that latent reasoning can be formalized as a classifier free guidance and policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose to use a training schemes from reinforcement learning and diffusion methods for latent reasoning models. Using the Tiny Recursive Model as our testbed, we show that with our modifications we can avoid dead compute steps and reduce the total number of forward passes by 18x while maintaining performance. Broadly speaking, we show how a policy improvement perspective on recursive steps can explain model behavior and provide insights for further improvements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.16886v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] REArtGS++: Generalizable Articulation Reconstruction with Temporal Geometry Constraint via Planar Gaussian Splatting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17059</link><description>arXiv:2511.17059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Articulated objects are pervasive in daily environments, such as drawers and refrigerators. Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74\% to 78\% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75\% to 80\% ($n$=406 patches).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.17355v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Opt4GPTQ: Co-Optimizing Memory and Computation for 4-bit GPTQ Quantized LLM Inference on Heterogeneous Platforms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19438</link><description>arXiv:2511.19438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) on heterogeneous computing platforms poses significant challenges to achieving high inference efficiency. To address these efficiency bottlenecks across diverse platforms, this paper proposes Opt4GPTQ, a practical optimization method designed for 4-bit GPTQ quantized LLMs inference on heterogeneous AI accelerators. Built upon the vLLM serving system, Opt4GPTQ integrates three platform-level optimization strategies: Shared Memory Buffering Optimization (SMB-Opt), which caches frequently accessed data in shared memory and employs single-threaded writes; Vectorized Memory Loading Optimization (VML-Opt), which utilizes vectorized memory operations for efficient data loading; and Inline Assembly Optimization (ILA-Opt), which directly leverages hardwarenative vector half-precision addition and fused multiply-accumulate instructions. Experimental results show that Opt4GPTQ effectively improves performance across various models while maintaining original model accuracy, achieving throughput gains of up to 84.42%. This work highlights the critical role of platformlevel engineering in enabling efficient LLMs inference on emerging architectures and provides valuable methodologies for future heterogeneous platform adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.19438v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Approximating Analytically-Intractable Likelihood Densities with Deterministic Arithmetic for Optimal Particle Filtering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01023</link><description>arXiv:2512.01023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle filtering algorithms have enabled practical solutions to problems in autonomous robotics (self-driving cars, UAVs, warehouse robots), target tracking, and econometrics, with further applications in speech processing and medicine (patient monitoring). Yet, their inherent weakness at representing the likelihood of the observation (which often leads to particle degeneracy) remains unaddressed for real-time resource-constrained systems. Improvements such as the optimal proposal and auxiliary particle filter mitigate this issue under specific circumstances and with increased computational cost. This work presents a new particle filtering method and its implementation, which enables tunably-approximative representation of arbitrary likelihood densities as program transformations of parametric distributions.Our method leverages a recent computing platform thatcan perform deterministic computation on probability distributionrepresentations (UxHw) without relying on stochastic methods.For non-Gaussian non-linear systems and with an optimal-auxiliary particle filter, we benchmark the likelihood evaluation error and speed for a total of 294840 evaluation points. For such models, the results show that the UxHw method leads to as much as 37.7x speedup compared to the Monte Carlo alternative. For narrow uniform measurement uncertainty, the particle filter falsely assigns zero likelihood as much as 81.89% of the time whereas UxHw achieves 1.52% false-zero rate. The UxHw approach achieves filter RMSE improvement of as much as 18.9% (average 3.3%) over the Monte Carlo alternative.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.01023v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CARL: Focusing Agentic Reinforcement Learning on Critical Actions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04949</link><description>arXiv:2512.04949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agents capable of accomplishing complex tasks through multiple interactions with the environment have emerged as a popular research direction. However, in such multi-step settings, the conventional group-level policy optimization algorithm becomes suboptimal because of its underlying assumption that each action holds equal contribution, which deviates significantly from reality. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of actions are critical in determining the final outcome. Building on this insight, we propose CARL, a critical-action-focused reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for long-horizon agentic reasoning. CARL leverages entropy as a heuristic proxy for action criticality and achieves focused training by assigning rewards to high-criticality actions while excluding low-criticality actions from model updates, avoiding noisy credit assignment and redundant computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARL achieves both stronger performance and higher efficiency across diverse evaluation settings. The source code will be publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.04949v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sparse Attention Post-Training for Mechanistic Interpretability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05865</link><description>arXiv:2512.05865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple post-training method that makes transformer attention sparse without sacrificing performance. Applying a flexible sparsity regularisation under a constrained-loss objective, we show on models up to 7B parameters that it is possible to retain the original pretraining loss while reducing attention connectivity to $\approx 0.4 \%$ of its edges. Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. Additionally, using cross-layer transcoders, we show that sparse attention substantially simplifies attention attribution, enabling a unified view of feature-based and circuit-based perspectives. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05865v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vector Quantization using Gaussian Variational Autoencoder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06609</link><description>arXiv:2512.06609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are discrete autoencoders that compress images into discrete tokens. However, they are difficult to train due to discretization. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective technique dubbed Gaussian Quant (GQ), which first trains a Gaussian VAE under certain constraints and then converts it into a VQ-VAE without additional training. For conversion, GQ generates random Gaussian noise as a codebook and finds the closest noise vector to the posterior mean. Theoretically, we prove that when the logarithm of the codebook size exceeds the bits-back coding rate of the Gaussian VAE, a small quantization error is guaranteed. Practically, we propose a heuristic to train Gaussian VAEs for effective conversion, named the target divergence constraint (TDC). Empirically, we show that GQ outperforms previous VQ-VAEs, such as VQGAN, FSQ, LFQ, and BSQ, on both UNet and ViT architectures. Furthermore, TDC also improves previous Gaussian VAE discretization methods, such as TokenBridge.

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUAs) can operate real-world digital interfaces but remain difficult to train due to the high cost of graphical user interface (GUI) interaction and the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. Existing datasets rely on human demonstrations, limiting scalability. A natural alternative is to synthesize data from strong CUAs, yet their rollouts are highly noisy, with incorrect or suboptimal actions consisting a large proportion of the steps, making naive imitation ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 267K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model. We train Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct models (7B and 32B) on WebSTAR. On WebVoyager, our 7B model surpasses SoTA open-source CUA model UI-TARS-1.5-7B by more than 15% with only supervised finetuning. Building on step-level grading, we further create WebSCORE, a dataset of graded step-level actions, and train StepRM, a 7B multimodal process reward model distilled from o4-mini, which matches its grading quality while being far more efficient to deploy at scale. Our results establish step-level filtering as a key principle for scalable CUA training and construct two new datasets (WebSTAR, WebSCORE) and a lightweight process reward model (StepRM) as practical tools to advance robust and efficient CUAs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10962v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bandit-Based Rate Adaptation for a Single-Server Queue</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12016</link><description>arXiv:2512.12016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of obtaining bounded time-average expected queue sizes in a single-queue system with a partial-feedback structure. Time is slotted; in slot $t$ the transmitter chooses a rate $V(t)$ from a continuous interval. Transmission succeeds if and only if $V(t)\le C(t)$, where channel capacities $\{C(t)\}$ and arrivals are i.i.d. draws from fixed but unknown distributions. The transmitter observes only binary acknowledgments (ACK/NACK) indicating success or failure. Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$ denote a sufficiently small lower bound on the slack between the arrival rate and the capacity region. We propose a phased algorithm that progressively refines a discretization of the uncountable infinite rate space and, without knowledge of $\varepsilon$, achieves a $\mathcal{O}\!\big(\log^{3.5}(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^{3}\big)$ time-average expected queue size uniformly over the horizon. We also prove a converse result showing that for any rate-selection algorithm, regardless of whether $\varepsilon$ is known, there exists an environment in which the worst-case time-average expected queue size is $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^{2})$. Thus, while a gap remains in the setting without knowledge of $\varepsilon$, we show that if $\varepsilon$ is known, a simple single-stage UCB type policy with a fixed discretization of the rate space achieves $\mathcal{O}\!\big(\log(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^{2}\big)$, matching the converse up to logarithmic factors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.12016v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MRD: Using Physically Based Differentiable Rendering to Probe Vision Models for 3D Scene Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12307</link><description>arXiv:2512.12307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved impressive success in many vision benchmarks, it remains difficult to understand and explain the representations and decisions of these models. Though vision models are typically trained on 2D inputs, they are often assumed to develop an implicit representation of the underlying 3D scene (for example, showing tolerance to partial occlusion, or the ability to reason about relative depth). Here, we introduce MRD (metamers rendered differentiably), an approach that uses physically based differentiable rendering to probe vision models' implicit understanding of generative 3D scene properties, by finding 3D scene parameters that are physically different but produce the same model activation (i.e. are model metamers). Unlike previous pixel-based methods for evaluating model representations, these reconstruction results are always grounded in physical scene descriptions. This means we can, for example, probe a model's sensitivity to object shape while holding material and lighting constant. As a proof-of-principle, we assess multiple models in their ability to recover scene parameters of geometry (shape) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (material). The results show high similarity in model activation between target and optimized scenes, with varying visual results. Qualitatively, these reconstructions help investigate the physical scene attributes to which models are sensitive or invariant. MRD holds promise for advancing our understanding of both computer and human vision by enabling analysis of how physical scene parameters drive changes in model responses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.12307v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fine-tuned LLM-based Code Migration Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13515</link><description>arXiv:2512.13515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study presents the outcomes of research and experimental validation in the domain of automated codebase migration, with a focus on addressing challenges in transitioning SQL-based systems. The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.13515v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MindDrive: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Autonomous Driving via Online Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13636</link><description>arXiv:2512.13636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.13636v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Double Life of Code World Models: Provably Unmasking Malicious Behavior Through Execution Traces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13821</link><description>arXiv:2512.13821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate code with minimal human oversight, raising critical concerns about backdoor injection and malicious behavior. We present Cross-Trace Verification Protocol (CTVP), a novel AI control framework that verifies untrusted code-generating models through semantic orbit analysis. Rather than directly executing potentially malicious code, CTVP leverages the model's own predictions of execution traces across semantically equivalent program transformations. By analyzing consistency patterns in these predicted traces, we detect behavioral anomalies indicative of backdoors. Our approach introduces the Adversarial Robustness Quotient (ARQ), which quantifies the computational cost of verification relative to baseline generation, demonstrating exponential growth with orbit size. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic bounds showing non-gamifiability - adversaries cannot improve through training due to fundamental space complexity constraints. This work demonstrates that semantic orbit analysis provides a theoretically grounded approach to AI control for code generation tasks, though practical deployment requires addressing the high false positive rates observed in initial evaluations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.13821v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Softly Constrained Denoisers for Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14980</link><description>arXiv:2512.14980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to produce samples that respect constraints, a common requirement in scientific applications. Recent approaches have introduced regularization terms in the loss or guidance methods during sampling to enforce such constraints, but they bias the generative model away from the true data distribution. This is a problem when the constraint is misspecified, which is a common issue in scientific applications where constraint formulation is challenging. We propose to integrate guidance-inspired adjustments to the denoiser, instead of the loss or sampling loop. This achieves a soft inductive bias towards constraint-compliant samples. We show that these softly constrained denoisers exploit constraint knowledge to improve compliance over standard denoisers, while maintaining enough flexibility to deviate from it in case of misspecification with observed data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.14980v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A 96pJ/Frame/Pixel and 61pJ/Event Anti-UAV System with Hybrid Object Tracking Modes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17939</link><description>arXiv:2512.17939v2 Announce Type: replace

Implemented in 40 nm CMOS technology, the 2 mm^2 chip achieves 96 pJ per frame per pixel and 61 pJ per event at 0.8 V, and reaches 98.2 percent recognition accuracy on public UAV datasets across 50 to 400 m ranges and 5 to 80 pixels per second speeds. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art end-to-end energy efficiency for anti-UAV systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.17939v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VisionDirector: Vision-Language Guided Closed-Loop Refinement for Generative Image Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19243</link><description>arXiv:2512.19243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models can now produce photorealistic imagery, yet they still struggle with the long, multi-goal prompts that professional designers issue. To expose this gap and better evaluate models' performance in real-world settings, we introduce Long Goal Bench (LGBench), a 2,000-task suite (1,000 T2I and 1,000 I2I) whose average instruction contains 18 to 22 tightly coupled goals spanning global layout, local object placement, typography, and logo fidelity. We find that even state-of-the-art models satisfy fewer than 72 percent of the goals and routinely miss localized edits, confirming the brittleness of current pipelines. To address this, we present VisionDirector, a training-free vision-language supervisor that (i) extracts structured goals from long instructions, (ii) dynamically decides between one-shot generation and staged edits, (iii) runs micro-grid sampling with semantic verification and rollback after every edit, and (iv) logs goal-level rewards. We further fine-tune the planner with Group Relative Policy Optimization, yielding shorter edit trajectories (3.1 versus 4.2 steps) and stronger alignment. VisionDirector achieves new state of the art on GenEval (plus 7 percent overall) and ImgEdit (plus 0.07 absolute) while producing consistent qualitative improvements on typography, multi-object scenes, and pose editing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19243v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] (Im)possibility of Incentive Design for Challenge-based Blockchain Protocols</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20864</link><description>arXiv:2512.20864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchains offer a decentralized and secure execution environment strong enough to host cryptocurrencies, but the state-replication model makes on-chain computation expensive. To avoid heavy on-chain workloads, systems like Truebit and optimistic rollups use challenge-based protocols, performing computations off-chain and invoking the chain only when challenged. This keeps normal-case costs low and, if at least one honest challenger exists, can catch fraud. What has been less clear is whether honest challengers are actually incentivized and a dishonest proposer is properly damaged under the worst case environment. We build a model with a colluding minority, heterogeneous costs, and three ordering modes. We then ask whether two goals can be met together: honest non-loss and fraud deterrence. Our results are clear: in single-winner designs, the incentive design is impossible or limited in scale. By contrast, in multi-winner designs, we obtain simple, explicit conditions under which both goals hold.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20864v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] See Less, See Right: Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping For Multimodal Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22120</link><description>arXiv:2512.22120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often benefit from intermediate visual cues, either injected via external tools or generated as latent visual tokens during reasoning, but these mechanisms still overlook fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and incur high inference-time cost. In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22120v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diversity or Precision?

Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22955v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fancy Some Chips for Your TeaStore?

Abstract: When designing new web applications, developers must cope with different kinds of constraints relative to the resources they rely on: software, hardware, network, online micro-services, or any combination of the mentioned entities. Together, these entities form a complex system of communicating interdependent processes, physical or logical. It is very desirable that such system ensures its robustness to provide a good quality of service. In this paper we introduce Chips, a language that aims at facilitating the design of models made of various entwined components.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often face challenges in fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, to our best knowledge, the first fully active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized unimodal tools to achieve more fine-grained omnimodal reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, we demonstrate a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and closed-source models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy without training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23646v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Colorful Pinball: Density-Weighted Quantile Regression for Conditional Guarantee of Conformal Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24139</link><description>arXiv:2512.24139v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While conformal prediction provides robust marginal coverage guarantees, achieving reliable conditional coverage for specific inputs remains challenging. Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \(1-\alpha \pm \delta\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss. We provide a theoretical analysis with exact non-asymptotic guarantees characterizing the resulting excess risk. Extensive experiments on diverse high-dimensional real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable improvements in conditional coverage performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24139v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Probabilistic Supervision for Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24162</link><description>arXiv:2512.24162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets without explicitly modeling predictive uncertainty. With this in mind, we propose Deep Probabilistic Supervision (DPS), a principled learning framework constructing sample-specific target distributions via statistical inference on the model's own predictions, remaining independent of hard targets after initialization. We show that DPS consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g., +2.0% for DenseNet-264 on ImageNet) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing self-distillation methods. When combined with a contrastive loss, DPS achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24162v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RANGER: A Monocular Zero-Shot Semantic Navigation Framework through Contextual Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24212</link><description>arXiv:2512.24212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently finding targets in complex environments is fundamental to real-world embodied applications. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning. The framework integrates several key components: keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model (VLM)-driven exploration value estimation, high-level adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution. Experiments on the HM3D benchmark and real-world environments demonstrate that RANGER achieves competitive performance in terms of navigation success rate and exploration efficiency, while showing superior ICL adaptability, with no previous 3D mapping of the environment required.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24212v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantifying and Inducing Shape Bias in CNNs via Max-Pool Dilation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05599</link><description>arXiv:2601.05599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit a well-known texture bias, prioritizing local patterns over global shapes - a tendency inherent to their convolutional architecture. While this bias is beneficial for texture-rich natural images, it often degrades performance on shape-dominant data such as illustrations and sketches. Although prior work has proposed shape-biased models to mitigate this issue, these approaches lack a quantitative metric for identifying which datasets would actually benefit from such modifications. To address this limitation, we propose a data-driven metric that quantifies the shape-texture balance within a dataset by computing the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between an image's luminance (Y) channel and its L0-smoothed counterpart. Building on this metric, we introduce a computationally efficient adaptation method that promotes shape bias by modifying the dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen. Experimental results demonstrate consistent accuracy improvements on shape-dominant datasets, particularly in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical, requiring training only the final classification layer.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05599v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantification and Classification of Carbon Nanotubes in Electron Micrographs using Vision Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06673</link><description>arXiv:2601.06673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of carbon nanotube morphologies in electron microscopy images is vital for exposure assessment and toxicological studies, yet current workflows rely on slow, subjective manual segmentation. This work presents a unified framework leveraging vision foundation models to automate the quantification and classification of CNTs in electron microscopy images. First, we introduce an interactive quantification tool built on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that segments particles with near-perfect accuracy using minimal user input. Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data. Crucially, this instance-level processing allows the framework to resolve mixed samples, correctly classifying distinct particle types co-existing within a single field of view. These results demonstrate that integrating zero-shot segmentation with self-supervised feature learning enables high-throughput, reproducible nanomaterial analysis, transforming a labor-intensive bottleneck into a scalable, data-driven process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06673v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network for Reliable Multimodal Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07163</link><description>arXiv:2601.07163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable learning of multimodal data (e.g., multi-omics) is a widely concerning issue, especially in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnosis. However, low-quality data induced by multimodal noise poses a major challenge in this domain, causing existing methods to suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to handle heterogeneous data noise, hindering robust multimodal representation learning. Second, they exhibit limited adaptability and generalization when encountering previously unseen noise. To address these issues, we propose Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network (TAHCD). On one hand, TAHCD introduces the Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment to reliably remove heterogeneous noise. They account for noise at both global and instance levels and enable jointly removal of modality-specific and cross-modality noise, achieving robust learning. On the other hand, TAHCD introduces Test-Time Cooperative Enhancement, which adaptively updates the model in response to input noise in a label-free manner, thus improving generalization. This is achieved by collaboratively enhancing the joint removal process of modality-specific and cross-modality noise across global and instance levels according to sample noise. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance, robustness, and generalization compared with state-of-the-art reliable multimodal learning approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07163v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SIRR-LMM: Single-image Reflection Removal via Large Multimodal Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07209</link><description>arXiv:2601.07209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glass surfaces create complex interactions of reflected and transmitted light, making single-image reflection removal (SIRR) challenging.

We introduce a synthetic dataset generation framework that path-traces 3D glass models over real background imagery to create physically accurate reflection scenarios with varied glass properties, camera settings, and post-processing effects. To leverage the capabilities of Large Multimodal Model (LMM), we concatenate the image layers into a single composite input, apply joint captioning, and fine-tune the model using task-specific LoRA rather than full-parameter training. This enables our approach to achieve improved reflection removal and separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07209v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ESDD2: Environment-Aware Speech and Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge Evaluation Plan</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07303</link><description>arXiv:2601.07303v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio recorded in real-world environments often contains a mixture of foreground speech and background environmental sounds. With rapid advances in text-to-speech, voice conversion, and other generation models, either component can now be modified independently. Such component-level manipulations are harder to detect, as the remaining unaltered component can mislead the systems designed for whole deepfake audio, and they often sound more natural to human listeners. To address this gap, we have proposed CompSpoofV2 dataset and a separation-enhanced joint learning framework. CompSpoofV2 is a large-scale curated dataset designed for component-level audio anti-spoofing, which contains over 250k audio samples, with a total duration of approximately 283 hours. Based on the CompSpoofV2 and the separation-enhanced joint learning framework, we launch the Environment-Aware Speech and Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge (ESDD2), focusing on component-level spoofing, where both speech and environmental sounds may be manipulated or synthesized, creating a more challenging and realistic detection scenario. The challenge will be held in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2026 (ICME 2026).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07303v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Resisting Manipulative Bots in Meme Coin Copy Trading: A Multi-Agent Approach with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08641</link><description>arXiv:2601.08641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Copy trading has become the dominant entry strategy in meme coin markets. However, due to the market's extremely illiquid and volatile nature, the strategy exposes an exploitable attack surface: adversaries deploy manipulative bots to front-run trades, conceal positions, and fabricate sentiment, systematically extracting value from na\"ive copiers at scale. Despite its prevalence, bot-driven manipulation remains largely unexplored, and no robust defensive framework exists. We propose a manipulation-resistant copy-trading system based on a multi-agent architecture powered by a multi-modal large language model (LLM) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Our approach outperforms zero-shot and most statistic-driven baselines in prediction accuracy as well as all baselines in economic performance, achieving an average copier return of 3% per meme coin investment under realistic market frictions. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of agent-based defenses and predictability of trader profitability in adversarial meme coin markets, providing a practical foundation for robust copy trading.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08641v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Example for Domain Adaptation Using CycleGAN</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08776</link><description>arXiv:2601.08776v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is crucial for advancing large-scale reasoning models. However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09361v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SolarGPT-QA: A Domain-Adaptive Large Language Model for Educational Question Answering in Space Weather and Heliophysics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12131</link><description>arXiv:2601.12131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar activity, including solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and geomagnetic storms, can significantly impact satellites, aviation, power grids, data centers, and space missions. Extreme solar events can cause substantial economic damage with limited advance warning, underscoring the importance of early-warning systems, accurate forecasting, and effective education in space science. Although large language models (LLMs) perform well on general tasks, they often lack domain-specific knowledge and pedagogical capability to clearly explain complex space science concepts. We introduce SolarGPT-QA, a question answering system based on a domain-adapted large language model built on the LLaMA-3 base model. The model is trained using scientific literature and large-scale question-answer data generated with GPT-4 and refined using Grok-3 in a student-friendly storytelling style. Human pairwise evaluations show that SolarGPT-QA outperforms general-purpose models in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance compared to instruction-tuned models for educational explanations in space weather and heliophysics. A small pilot student comprehension study further suggests improved clarity and accessibility of the generated explanations. Ablation experiments indicate that combining domain-adaptive pretraining with pedagogical fine-tuning is important for balancing scientific accuracy and educational effectiveness. This work represents an initial step toward a broader SolarGPT framework for space science education and forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12131v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AlphaSyndrome: Tackling the Syndrome Measurement Circuit Scheduling Problem for QEC Codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12509</link><description>arXiv:2601.12509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet repeated syndrome-measurement cycles dominate its spacetime and hardware cost. Although stabilizers commute and admit many valid execution orders, different schedules induce distinct error-propagation paths under realistic noise, leading to large variations in logical error rate. Outside of surface codes, effective syndrome-measurement scheduling remains largely unexplored. We present AlphaSyndrome, an automated synthesis framework for scheduling syndrome-measurement circuits in general commuting-stabilizer codes under minimal assumptions: mutually commuting stabilizers and a heuristic decoder. AlphaSyndrome formulates scheduling as an optimization problem that shapes error propagation to (i) avoid patterns close to logical operators and (ii) remain within the decoder's correctable region. The framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore ordering and parallelism, guided by code structure and decoder feedback. Across diverse code families, sizes, and decoders, AlphaSyndrome reduces logical error rates by 80.6% on average (up to 96.2%) relative to depth-optimal baselines, matches Google's hand-crafted surface-code schedules, and outperforms IBM's schedule for the Bivariate Bicycle code.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12509v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Low-Resource Machine Translation via Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12535</link><description>arXiv:2601.12535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) has gained increasing attention as parallel data from low-resource language communities is collected, but many potential methods for improving low-resource MT remain unexplored. We investigate a self-supervised reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning for translation in low-resource settings using round-trip bootstrapping with the No Language Left Behind (NLLB) family of models. Our approach translates English into a target low-resource language and then back into English, using a combination of chrF++ and BLEU as the reward function on the reconstructed English sentences. Using the NLLB-MD dataset, we evaluate both the 600M and 1.3B parameter NLLB models and observe consistent improvements for the following languages: Central Aymara, Friulian, Wolof and Russian. Qualitative inspection of translation outputs indicates increased fluency and semantic fidelity. We argue that our method can further benefit from scale, enabling models to increasingly leverage their pretrained knowledge and continue self-improving.

Abstract: Color photometric stereo enables single-shot surface reconstruction, extending conventional photometric stereo that requires multiple images of a static scene under varying illumination to dynamic scenarios. However, most existing approaches assume ideal distant lighting and Lambertian reflectance, leaving more practical near-light conditions and non-Lambertian surfaces underexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework that leverages neural implicit representations for depth and BRDF modeling under the assumption of mono-chromaticity (uniform chromaticity and homogeneous material), which alleviates the inherent ill-posedness of color photometric stereo and allows for detailed surface recovery from just one image. Furthermore, we design a compact optical tactile sensor to validate our approach. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust surface reconstruction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12666v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Visually Explaining Statistical Tests with Applications in Biomedical Imaging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13899</link><description>arXiv:2601.13899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural two-sample tests have recently shown strong power for detecting distributional differences between groups, yet their black-box nature limits interpretability and practical adoption in biomedical analysis. Moreover, most existing post-hoc explainability methods rely on class labels, making them unsuitable for label-free statistical testing settings. We propose an explainable deep statistical testing framework that augments deep two-sample tests with sample-level and feature-level explanations, revealing which individual samples and which input features drive statistically significant group differences. Our method highlights which image regions and which individual samples contribute most to the detected group difference, providing spatial and instance-wise insight into the test's decision. Applied to biomedical imaging data, the proposed framework identifies influential samples and highlights anatomically meaningful regions associated with disease-related variation.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are widely used in real-world applications such as customer service, web navigation, and software engineering. As these systems become more autonomous and are deployed at scale, understanding why an agent takes a particular action becomes increasingly important for accountability and governance. However, existing research predominantly focuses on \textit{failure attribution} to localize explicit errors in unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining \textbf{the reason behind agent behaviors}. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind the agent behavior, offering a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of new entities -- driven by cultural shifts, evolving trends, and personalized user data -- poses a significant challenge for existing Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from "over-correction", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.
  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length. Extensive experiments using the Phi-4-MM model across 11 multilingual locales demonstrate that LOGIC achieves an average 9% relative reduction in Entity WER with a negligible 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15397v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reflexis: Supporting Reflexivity and Rigor in Collaborative Qualitative Analysis through Design for Deliberation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15445</link><description>arXiv:2601.15445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) is a critical method for generating deep interpretive insights. Yet its core tenets, including researcher reflexivity, tangible analytical evolution, and productive disagreement, are often poorly supported by software tools that prioritize speed and consensus over interpretive depth. To address this gap, we introduce Reflexis, a collaborative workspace that centers these practices. It supports reflexivity by integrating in-situ reflection prompts, makes code evolution transparent and tangible, and scaffolds collaborative interpretation by turning differences into productive, positionality-aware dialogue. Results from our paired-analyst study (N=12) indicate that Reflexis encouraged participants toward more granular reflection and reframed disagreements as productive conversations. The evaluation also surfaced key design tensions, including a desire for higher-level, networked memos and more user control over the timing of proactive alerts. Reflexis contributes a design framework for tools that prioritize rigor and transparency to support deep, collaborative interpretation in an age of automation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15445v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Connect the Dots: Knowledge Graph-Guided Crawler Attack on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15678</link><description>arXiv:2601.15678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stealing attacks pose a persistent threat to the intellectual property of deployed machine-learning systems. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) intensifies this risk by extending the attack surface beyond model weights to knowledge base that often contains IP-bearing assets such as proprietary runbooks, curated domain collections, or licensed documents. Recent work shows that multi-turn questioning can gradually steal corpus content from RAG systems, yet existing attacks are largely heuristic and often plateau early. We address this gap by formulating RAG knowledge-base stealing as an adaptive stochastic coverage problem (ASCP), where each query is a stochastic action and the goal is to maximize the conditional expected marginal gain (CMG) in corpus coverage under a query budget. Bridging ASCP to real-world black-box RAG knowledge-base stealing raises three challenges: CMG is unobservable, the natural-language action space is intractably large, and feasibility constraints require stealthy queries that remain effective under diverse architectures. We introduce RAGCrawler, a knowledge graph-guided attacker that maintains a global attacker-side state to estimate coverage gains, schedule high-value semantic anchors, and generate non-redundant natural queries. Across four corpora and four generators with BGE retriever, RAGCrawler achieves 66.8% average coverage (up to 84.4%) within 1,000 queries, improving coverage by 44.90% relative to the strongest baseline. It also reduces the queries needed to reach 70% coverage by at least 4.03x on average and enables surrogate reconstruction with answer similarity up to 0.699. Our attack is also scalable to retriever switching and newer RAG techniques like query rewriting and multi-query retrieval.

Abstract: How can we use AI to discover a new state of the art for a scientific problem? Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erd\H{o}s' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis. Our solutions are reviewed by experts or the organizers. All our results are achieved with an open model, OpenAI gpt-oss-120b, and can be reproduced with our publicly available code, in contrast to previous best results that required closed frontier models. Our test-time training runs are performed using Tinker, an API by Thinking Machines, with a cost of only a few hundred dollars per problem.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16175v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Attribute-Decoupled Encryption for Trusted Respiratory Monitoring in Resource-Limited Consumer Healthcare</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16241</link><description>arXiv:2601.16241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Respiratory monitoring is an extremely important task in modern medical services. Due to its significant advantages, e.g., non-contact, radar-based respiratory monitoring has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. Unfortunately, though it can achieve high monitoring accuracy, consumer electronics-grade radar data inevitably contains User-sensitive Identity Information (USI), which may be maliciously used and further lead to privacy leakage. To track these challenges, by variational mode decomposition (VMD) and adversarial loss-based encryption, we propose a novel Trusted Respiratory Monitoring paradigm, Tru-RM, to perform automated respiratory monitoring through radio signals while effectively anonymizing USI. The key enablers of Tru-RM are Attribute Feature Decoupling (AFD), Flexible Perturbation Encryptor (FPE), and robust Perturbation Tolerable Network (PTN) used for attribute decomposition, identity encryption, and perturbed respiratory monitoring, respectively. Specifically, AFD is designed to decompose the raw radar signals into the universal respiratory component, the personal difference component, and other unrelated components. Then, by using large noise to drown out the other unrelated components, and the phase noise algorithm with a learning intensity parameter to eliminate USI in the personal difference component, FPE is designed to achieve complete user identity information encryption without affecting respiratory features. Finally, by designing the transferred generalized domain-independent network, PTN is employed to accurately detect respiration when waveforms change significantly. Extensive experiments based on various detection distances, respiratory patterns, and durations demonstrate the superior performance of Tru-RM on strong anonymity of USI, and high detection accuracy of perturbed respiratory waveforms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16241v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An AI-enabled tool for quantifying overlapping red blood cell sickling dynamics in microfluidic assays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17703</link><description>arXiv:2601.17703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding sickle cell dynamics requires accurate identification of morphological transitions under diverse biophysical conditions, particularly in densely packed and overlapping cell populations. Here, we present an automated deep learning framework that integrates AI-assisted annotation, segmentation, classification, and instance counting to quantify red blood cell (RBC) populations across varying density regimes in time-lapse microscopy data. Experimental images were annotated using the Roboflow platform to generate labeled dataset for training an nnU-Net segmentation model. The trained network enables prediction of the temporal evolution of the sickle cell fraction, while a watershed algorithm resolves overlapping cells to enhance quantification accuracy. Despite requiring only a limited amount of labeled data for training, the framework achieves high segmentation performance, effectively addressing challenges associated with scarce manual annotations and cell overlap. By quantitatively tracking dynamic changes in RBC morphology, this approach can more than double the experimental throughput via densely packed cell suspensions, capture drug-dependent sickling behavior, and reveal distinct mechanobiological signatures of cellular morphological evolution. Overall, this AI-driven framework establishes a scalable and reproducible computational platform for investigating cellular biomechanics and assessing therapeutic efficacy in microphysiological systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17703v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EEG Foundation Models: Progresses, Benchmarking, and Open Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17883</link><description>arXiv:2601.17883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), aiming to learn transferable neural representations from large-scale heterogeneous recordings. Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17883v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constraint-Aware Discrete-Time PID Gain Optimization for Robotic Joint Control Under Actuator Saturation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18639</link><description>arXiv:2601.18639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise regulation of rotary actuation is fundamental in autonomous robotics, yet practical PID loops deviate from continuous-time theory due to discrete-time execution, actuator saturation, and small delays and measurement imperfections. We present an implementation-aware analysis and tuning workflow for saturated discrete-time joint control. We (i) derive PI stability regions under Euler and exact zero-order-hold (ZOH) discretizations using the Jury criterion, (ii) evaluate a discrete back-calculation anti-windup realization under saturation-dominant regimes, and (iii) propose a hybrid-certified Bayesian optimization workflow that screens analytically unstable candidates and behaviorally unsafe transients while optimizing a robust IAE objective with soft penalties on overshoot and saturation duty. Baseline sweeps ($\tau=1.0$~s, $\Delta t=0.01$~s, $u\in[-10,10]$) quantify rise/settle trends for P/PI/PID. Under a randomized model family emulating uncertainty, delay, noise, quantization, and tighter saturation, robustness-oriented tuning improves median IAE from $0.843$ to $0.430$ while keeping median overshoot below $2\%$. In simulation-only tuning, the certification screen rejects $11.6\%$ of randomly sampled gains within bounds before full robust evaluation, improving sample efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18639v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constructing self-referential instances for the clique problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19393</link><description>arXiv:2601.19393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose constructing self-referential instances to reveal the inherent algorithmic hardness of the clique problem. First, we prove the existence of a phase transition phenomenon for the clique problem in the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph model and derive an exact location for the transition point. Subsequently, at the transition point, we construct a family of graphs. In this family, each graph shares the same number of vertices, number of edges, and degree sequence, yet both instances containing a $k$-clique and instances without any $k$-clique are included. These two states can be transformed into each other through a symmetric transformation that preserves the degree of every vertex. This property explains why exhaustive search is required in the critical region: an algorithm must search nearly the entire solution space to determine the existence of a solution; otherwise, a counterinstance can be constructed from the original instance using the symmetric transformation. Finally, this paper elaborates on the intrinsic reason for this phenomenon from the independence of the solution space.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19393v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physical Human-Robot Interaction: A Critical Review of Safety Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19462</link><description>arXiv:2601.19462v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19827v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] STELLAR: Structure-guided LLM Assertion Retrieval and Generation for Formal Verification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19903</link><description>arXiv:2601.19903v2 Announce Type: replace

Experiments show that STELLAR achieves superior syntax correctness, stylistic alignment, and functional correctness, highlighting structure-aware retrieval as a promising direction for industrial FV.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19903v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Diffusion Language Model Decoding through Joint Search in Generation Order and Token Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20339</link><description>arXiv:2601.20339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer order-agnostic generation that can explore many possible decoding trajectories. However, current decoding methods commit to a single trajectory, limiting exploration in trajectory space. We introduce Order-Token Search to explore this space through jointly searching over generation order and token values. Its core is a likelihood estimator that scores denoising actions, enabling stable pruning and efficient exploration of diverse trajectories. Across mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks, Order-Token Search consistently outperforms baselines on GSM8K, MATH500, Countdown, and HumanEval (3.1%, 3.8%, 7.9%, and 6.8% absolute over backbone), matching or surpassing diffu-GRPO post-trained d1-LLaDA.

Abstract: Touch data from mobile devices are collected at scale but reveal little about the interactions that produce them. While biomechanical simulations can illuminate motor control processes, they have not yet been developed for touch interactions. To close this gap, we propose a novel computational problem: synthesizing plausible motion directly from logs. Our key insight is a reinforcement learning-driven musculoskeletal forward simulation that generates biomechanically plausible motion sequences consistent with events recorded in touch logs. We achieve this by integrating a software emulator into a physics simulator, allowing biomechanical models to manipulate real applications in real-time. Log2Motion produces rich syntheses of user movements from touch logs, including estimates of motion, speed, accuracy, and effort. We assess the plausibility of generated movements by comparing against human data from a motion capture study and prior findings, and demonstrate Log2Motion in a large-scale dataset. Biomechanical motion synthesis provides a new way to understand log data, illuminating the ergonomics and motor control underlying touch interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21043v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Partial Feedback Online Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21462</link><description>arXiv:2601.21462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new learning protocol, termed partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of acceptable labels, but the learner observes only one acceptable label per round. We highlight that, while classical version space is widely used for online learnability, it does not directly extend to this setting. We address this obstacle by introducing a collection version space, which maintains sets of hypotheses rather than individual hypotheses. Using this tool, we obtain a tight characterization of learnability in the set-realizable regime. In particular, we define the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim), and show that they tightly characterize the minimax regret for deterministic and randomized learners, respectively. We further identify a nested inclusion condition under which deterministic and randomized learnability coincide, resolving an open question of Raman et al. (2024b). Finally, given a hypothesis space H, we show that beyond set realizability, the minimax regret can be linear even when |H|=2, highlighting a barrier beyond set realizability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21462v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mil-SCORE: Benchmarking Long-Context Geospatial Reasoning and Planning in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21826</link><description>arXiv:2601.21826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are applied to increasingly longer and more complex tasks, there is a growing need for realistic long-context benchmarks that require selective reading and integration of heterogeneous, multi-modal information sources. This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context. The benchmark includes a diverse set of question types across seven categories targeting both factual recall and multi-step reasoning about constraints, strategy, and spatial analysis. We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models. Our findings highlight substantial headroom on MilSCORE, indicating that current systems struggle with realistic, scenario-level long-context planning, and positioning MilSCORE as a challenging testbed for future work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21826v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Dial-a-Ride: A Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach to the Electric Dial-a-Ride Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22052</link><description>arXiv:2601.22052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban mobility systems are transitioning toward electric, on-demand services, creating operational challenges for fleet management under energy and service-quality constraints. The Electric Dial-a-Ride Problem (E-DARP) extends the classical dial-a-ride problem by incorporating limited battery capacity and nonlinear charging dynamics, increasing computational complexity and limiting the scalability of exact methods for real-time use. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach based on an edge-centric graph neural network encoder and an attention-driven route construction policy. By operating directly on edge attributes such as travel time and energy consumption, the method captures non-Euclidean, asymmetric, and energy-dependent routing costs in real road networks. The learned policy jointly optimizes routing, charging, and service quality without relying on Euclidean assumptions or handcrafted heuristics. The approach is evaluated on two case studies using ride-sharing data from San Francisco. On benchmark instances, the method achieves solutions within 0.4% of best-known results while reducing computation times by orders of magnitude. A second case study considers large-scale instances with up to 250 request pairs, realistic energy models, and nonlinear charging. On these instances, the learned policy outperforms Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) by 9.5% in solution quality while achieving 100% service completion, with inference times under 10 seconds compared to hours for the metaheuristic. Finally, sensitivity analyses quantify the impact of battery capacity, fleet size, ride-sharing capacity, and reward weights, while robustness experiments show that deterministically trained policies generalize effectively under stochastic conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22052v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Boosting CVaR Policy Optimization with Quantile Gradients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22100</link><description>arXiv:2601.22100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing Conditional Value-at-risk (CVaR) using policy gradient (a.k.a CVaR-PG) faces significant challenges of sample inefficiency. This inefficiency stems from the fact that it focuses on tail-end performance and overlooks many sampled trajectories. We address this problem by augmenting CVaR with an expected quantile term. Quantile optimization admits a dynamic programming formulation that leverages all sampled data, thus improves sample efficiency. This does not alter the CVaR objective since CVaR corresponds to the expectation of quantile over the tail. Empirical results in domains with verifiable risk-averse behavior show that our algorithm within the Markovian policy class substantially improves upon CVaR-PG and consistently outperforms other existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22100v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SWE-Replay: Efficient Test-Time Scaling for Software Engineering Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22129</link><description>arXiv:2601.22129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22129v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One-step Latent-free Image Generation with Pixel Mean Flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22158</link><description>arXiv:2601.22158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22158v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Non-Intrusive Graph-Based Bot Detection for E-Commerce Using Inductive Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22579</link><description>arXiv:2601.22579v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malicious bots pose a growing threat to e-commerce platforms by scraping data, hoarding inventory, and perpetrating fraud. Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22579v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PEAR: Pixel-aligned Expressive humAn mesh Recovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22693</link><description>arXiv:2601.22693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing detailed 3D human meshes from a single in-the-wild image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing SMPLX-based methods often suffer from slow inference, produce only coarse body poses, and exhibit misalignments or unnatural artifacts in fine-grained regions such as the face and hands. These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

Abstract: We present MeshGraphNet-Transformer (MGN-T), a novel architecture that combines the global modeling capabilities of Transformers with the geometric inductive bias of MeshGraphNets, while preserving a mesh-based graph representation. MGN-T overcomes a key limitation of standard MGN, the inefficient long-range information propagation caused by iterative message passing on large, high-resolution meshes. A physics-attention Transformer serves as a global processor, updating all nodal states simultaneously while explicitly retaining node and edge attributes. By directly capturing long-range physical interactions, MGN-T eliminates the need for deep message-passing stacks or hierarchical, coarsened meshes, enabling efficient learning on high-resolution meshes with varying geometries, topologies, and boundary conditions at an industrial scale.
  We demonstrate that MGN-T successfully handles industrial-scale meshes for impact dynamics, a setting in which standard MGN fails due message-passing under-reaching. The method accurately models self-contact, plasticity, and multivariate outputs, including internal, phenomenological plastic variables. Moreover, MGN-T outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on classical benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining practical efficiency, using only a fraction of the parameters required by competing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23177v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Investigating the Impact of Histopathological Foundation Models on Regressive Prediction of Homologous Recombination Deficiency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00151</link><description>arXiv:2602.00151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale histopathology data have found great success in various fields of computational pathology, but their impact on regressive biomarker prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate histopathological foundation models for regression-based tasks, demonstrated through the prediction of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score - a critical biomarker for personalized cancer treatment. Within multiple instance learning frameworks, we extract patch-level features from whole slide images (WSI) using five state-of-the-art foundation models, and evaluate their impact compared to contrastive learning-based features. Models are trained to predict continuous HRD scores based on these extracted features across breast, endometrial, and lung cancer cohorts from two public medical data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on foundation model features consistently outperform the baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities while exhibiting systematic differences among the foundation models. Additionally, we propose a distribution-based upsampling strategy to mitigate target imbalance in these datasets, significantly improving the recall and balanced accuracy for underrepresented but clinically important patient populations. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different sampling strategies and instance bagsizes by ablation studies. Our results highlight the benefits of large-scale histopathological pretraining for more precise and transferable regressive biomarker prediction, showcasing its potential to advance AI-driven precision oncology.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00151v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Joint Continual Learning of Local Language Models and Cloud Offloading Decisions with Budget Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00166</link><description>arXiv:2602.00166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally deployed Small Language Models (SLMs) must continually support diverse tasks under strict memory and computation constraints, making selective reliance on cloud Large Language Models (LLMs) unavoidable. Regulating cloud assistance during continual learning is challenging, as naive reward-based reinforcement learning often yields unstable offloading behavior and exacerbates catastrophic forgetting as task distributions shift. We propose DA-GRPO, a dual-advantage extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization that incorporates cloud-usage constraints directly into advantage computation, avoiding fixed reward shaping and external routing models. This design enables the local model to jointly learn task competence and collaboration behavior, allowing cloud requests to emerge naturally during post-training while respecting a prescribed assistance budget. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that DA-GRPO improves post-switch accuracy, substantially reduces forgetting, and maintains stable cloud usage compared to prior collaborative and routing-based approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00166v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DecompressionLM: Deterministic, Diagnostic, and Zero-Shot Concept Graph Extraction from Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00377</link><description>arXiv:2602.00377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing knowledge probing methods rely on pre-defined queries, limiting extraction to known concepts. We introduce DecompressionLM, a stateless framework for zero-shot concept graph extraction that discovers what language models encode without pre-specified queries or shared cross-sequence state. Our method targets three limitations of common decoding-based probing approaches: (i) cross-sequence coupling that concentrates probability mass on high-frequency prefixes, (ii) competitive decoding effects that suppress long-tail concepts, and (iii) scalability constraints arising from sequential exploration. Using Van der Corput low-discrepancy sequences with arithmetic decoding, DecompressionLM enables deterministic, embarrassingly parallel generation without shared state across sequences. Across two model families and five quantization variants, we find that activation-aware quantization (AWQ-4bit) expands concept coverage by 30-170%, while uniform quantization (GPTQ-Int4) induces 71-86% coverage collapse - divergent behaviors not reliably reflected by explanation-level perplexity. Corpus-based verification further reveals a 19.6-point hallucination gap between top- and bottom-ranked MMLU-Pro Law models. DecompressionLM establishes concept coverage as a complementary evaluation dimension for assessing knowledge breadth and factual grounding in compressed models intended for deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00377v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust automatic brain vessel segmentation in 3D CTA scans using dynamic 4D-CTA data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00391</link><description>arXiv:2602.00391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a novel methodology for annotating the brain vasculature using dynamic 4D-CTA head scans. By using multiple time points from dynamic CTA acquisitions, we subtract bone and soft tissue to enhance the visualization of arteries and veins, reducing the effort required to obtain manual annotations of brain vessels. We then train deep learning models on our ground truth annotations by using the same segmentation for multiple phases from the dynamic 4D-CTA collection, effectively enlarging our dataset by 4 to 5 times and inducing robustness to contrast phases. In total, our dataset comprises 110 training images from 25 patients and 165 test images from 14 patients. In comparison with two similarly-sized datasets for CTA-based brain vessel segmentation, a nnUNet model trained on our dataset can achieve significantly better segmentations across all vascular regions, with an average mDC of 0.846 for arteries and 0.957 for veins in the TopBrain dataset. Furthermore, metrics such as average directed Hausdorff distance (adHD) and topology sensitivity (tSens) reflected similar trends: using our dataset resulted in low error margins (adHD of 0.304 mm for arteries and 0.078 for veins) and high sensitivity (tSens of 0.877 for arteries and 0.974 for veins), indicating excellent accuracy in capturing vessel morphology.

Abstract: We present ACE-Step v1.5, a highly efficient open-source music foundation model that brings commercial-grade generation to consumer hardware. On commonly used evaluation metrics, ACE-Step v1.5 achieves quality beyond most commercial music models while remaining extremely fast -- under 2 seconds per full song on an A100 and under 10 seconds on an RTX 3090. The model runs locally with less than 4GB of VRAM, and supports lightweight personalization: users can train a LoRA from just a few songs to capture their own style. At its core lies a novel hybrid architecture where the Language Model (LM) functions as an omni-capable planner: it transforms simple user queries into comprehensive song blueprints -- scaling from short loops to 10-minute compositions -- while synthesizing metadata, lyrics, and captions via Chain-of-Thought to guide the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Uniquely, this alignment is achieved through intrinsic reinforcement learning relying solely on the model's internal mechanisms, thereby eliminating the biases inherent in external reward models or human preferences. Beyond standard synthesis, ACE-Step v1.5 unifies precise stylistic control with versatile editing capabilities -- such as cover generation, repainting, and vocal-to-BGM conversion -- while maintaining strict adherence to prompts across 50+ languages. This paves the way for powerful tools that seamlessly integrate into the creative workflows of music artists, producers, and content creators.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) demands representations robust to drastic environmental and viewpoint shifts. Current aggregation paradigms, however, either rely on data-hungry supervision or simplistic first-order statistics, often neglecting intrinsic structural correlations. In this work, we propose a Second-Order Geometric Statistics framework that inherently captures geometric stability without training. We conceptualize scenes as covariance descriptors on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold, where perturbations manifest as tractable congruence transformations. By leveraging geometry-aware Riemannian mappings, we project these descriptors into a linearized Euclidean embedding, effectively decoupling signal structure from noise. Our approach introduces a training-free framework built upon fixed, pre-trained backbones, achieving strong zero-shot generalization without parameter updates. Extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves highly competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines, particularly excelling in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00841v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hallucination is a Consequence of Space-Optimality: A Rate-Distortion Theorem for Membership Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00906</link><description>arXiv:2602.00906v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate with high confidence on "random facts" that lack inferable patterns. We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified "closed world" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00906v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unifying Ranking and Generation in Query Auto-Completion via Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Multi-Objective Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01023</link><description>arXiv:2602.01023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query Auto-Completion (QAC) suggests query completions as users type, helping them articulate intent and reach results more efficiently. Existing approaches face fundamental challenges: traditional retrieve-and-rank pipelines have limited long-tail coverage and require extensive feature engineering, while recent generative methods suffer from hallucination and safety risks. We present a unified framework that reformulates QAC as end-to-end list generation through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-objective Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) reformulating QAC as end-to-end list generation with multi-objective optimization; (2) defining and deploying a suite of rule-based, model-based, and LLM-as-judge verifiers for QAC, and using them in a comprehensive methodology that combines RAG, multi-objective DPO, and iterative critique-revision for high-quality synthetic data; (3) a hybrid serving architecture enabling efficient production deployment under strict latency constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale commercial search platform demonstrates substantial improvements: offline metrics show gains across all dimensions, human evaluation yields +0.40 to +0.69 preference scores, and a controlled online experiment achieves 5.44\% reduction in keystrokes and 3.46\% increase in suggestion adoption, validating that unified generation with RAG and multi-objective alignment provides an effective solution for production QAC. This work represents a paradigm shift to end-to-end generation powered by large language models, RAG, and multi-objective alignment, establishing a production-validated framework that can benefit the broader search and recommendation industry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01023v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GMAC: Global Multi-View Constraint for Automatic Multi-Camera Extrinsic Calibration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01033</link><description>arXiv:2602.01033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic calibration of multi-camera systems, namely the accurate estimation of spatial extrinsic parameters, is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, panoramic perception, and multi-view data fusion. Existing methods typically rely on calibration targets, explicit geometric modeling, or task-specific neural networks. Such approaches often exhibit limited robustness and applicability in complex dynamic environments or online scenarios, making them difficult to deploy in practical applications. To address this, this paper proposes GMAC, a multi-camera extrinsic estimation framework based on the implicit geometric representations learned by multi-view reconstruction networks. GMAC models extrinsics as global variables constrained by the latent multi-view geometric structure and prunes and structurally reconfigures existing networks so that their latent features can directly support extrinsic prediction through a lightweight regression head, without requiring a completely new network design. Furthermore, GMAC jointly optimizes cross-view reprojection consistency and multi-view cycle consistency, ensuring geometric coherence across cameras while improving prediction accuracy and optimization stability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-camera datasets demonstrate that GMAC achieves accurate and stable extrinsic estimation without explicit 3D reconstruction or manual calibration, providing a new solution for efficient deployment and online calibration of multi-camera systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01033v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FUSE-Flow: Scalable Real-Time Multi-View Point Cloud Reconstruction Using Confidence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01035</link><description>arXiv:2602.01035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time multi-view point cloud reconstruction is a core problem in 3D vision and immersive perception, with wide applications in VR, AR, robotic navigation, digital twins, and computer interaction. Despite advances in multi-camera systems and high-resolution depth sensors, fusing large-scale multi-view depth observations into high-quality point clouds under strict real-time constraints remains challenging. Existing methods relying on voxel-based fusion, temporal accumulation, or global optimization suffer from high computational complexity, excessive memory usage, and limited scalability, failing to simultaneously achieve real-time performance, reconstruction quality, and multi-camera extensibility. We propose FUSE-Flow, a frame-wise, stateless, and linearly scalable point cloud streaming reconstruction framework. Each frame independently generates point cloud fragments, fused via two weights, measurement confidence and 3D distance consistency to suppress noise while preserving geometric details. For large-scale multi-camera efficiency, we introduce an adaptive spatial hashing-based weighted aggregation method: 3D space is adaptively partitioned by local point cloud density, representative points are selected per cell, and weighted fusion is performed to handle both sparse and dense regions. With GPU parallelization, FUSE-Flow achieves high-throughput, low-latency point cloud generation and fusion with linear complexity. Experiments demonstrate that the framework improves reconstruction stability and geometric fidelity in overlapping, depth-discontinuous, and dynamic scenes, while maintaining real-time frame rates on modern GPUs, verifying its effectiveness, robustness, and scalability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01035v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TxRay: Agentic Postmortem of Live Blockchain Attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01317</link><description>arXiv:2602.01317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has turned blockchains into financial infrastructure, allowing anyone to trade, lend, and build protocols without intermediaries, but this openness exposes pools of value controlled by code. Within five years, the DeFi ecosystem has lost over 15.75B USD to reported exploits. Many exploits arise from permissionless opportunities that any participant can trigger using only public state and standard interfaces, which we call Anyone-Can-Take (ACT) opportunities. Despite on-chain transparency, postmortem analysis remains slow and manual: investigations start from limited evidence, sometimes only a single transaction hash, and must reconstruct the exploit lifecycle by recovering related transactions, contract code, and state dependencies.
  We present TxRay, a Large Language Model (LLM) agentic postmortem system that uses tool calls to reconstruct live ACT attacks from limited evidence. Starting from one or more seed transactions, TxRay recovers the exploit lifecycle, derives an evidence-backed root cause, and generates a runnable, self-contained Proof of Concept (PoC) that deterministically reproduces the incident. TxRay self-checks postmortems by encoding incident-specific semantic oracles as executable assertions.
  To evaluate PoC correctness and quality, we develop PoCEvaluator, an independent agentic execution-and-review evaluator. On 114 incidents from DeFiHackLabs, TxRay produces an expert-aligned root cause and an executable PoC for 105 incidents, achieving 92.11% end-to-end reproduction. Under PoCEvaluator, 98.1% of TxRay PoCs avoid hard-coding attacker addresses, a +22.9pp lift over DeFiHackLabs. In a live deployment, TxRay delivers validated root causes in 40 minutes and PoCs in 59 minutes at median latency. TxRay's oracle-validated PoCs enable attack imitation, improving coverage by 15.6% and 65.5% over STING and APE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01317v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Enhanced Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: Applications of Newton's Laws in Financial Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) Algorithms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01388</link><description>arXiv:2602.01388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), a subset of machine learning focused on sequential decision-making, has emerged as a powerful approach for tackling financial trading problems. In finance, DRL is commonly used either to generate discrete trade signals or to determine continuous portfolio allocations. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for portfolio optimization that incorporates Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) into several DRL algorithms. The approach replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in both actor and critic components-utilizing learnable B-spline univariate functions to achieve parameter-efficient and more interpretable function approximation. During actor updates, we introduce a physics-informed regularization loss that promotes second-order temporal consistency between observed return dynamics and the action-induced portfolio adjustments. The proposed framework is evaluated across three equity markets-China, Vietnam, and the United States, covering both emerging and developed economies. Across all three markets, PIKAN-based agents consistently deliver higher cumulative and annualized returns, superior Sharpe and Calmar ratios, and more favorable drawdown characteristics compared to both standard DRL baselines and classical online portfolio-selection methods. This yields more stable training, higher Sharpe ratios, and superior performance compared to traditional DRL counterparts. The approach is particularly valuable in highly dynamic and noisy financial markets, where conventional DRL often suffers from instability and poor generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01388v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Gradient-Causal Gap: Why Gradient Importance Fails on Complex Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01442</link><description>arXiv:2602.01442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Removing ''important'' high-gradient components from a neural network can improve generalization, while removing unimportant'' low-gradient components can destroy it. We demonstrate this paradox by formalizing the \textit{Gradient-Causal Gap} in Transformers trained on algorithmic tasks. While gradient magnitude and causal importance align on simple tasks ($\rho=0.73$ for reversal), this relationship collapses as task complexity increases ($\rho=0.32$ for sorting), sometimes becoming inverted ($\rho=-0.11$). Pruning experiments reveal that gradient magnitude is not merely inaccurate but \textit{unpredictably} so. Removing low-gradient ''Hidden Heroes'' consistently devastates OOD accuracy ($-32\%$). Removing high-gradient ''Gradient Bloats'' is a coin flip: harmless in most seeds (indicating optimization noise), catastrophic in others (indicating overfitting circuits). This unpredictability means gradient-based pruning cannot reliably preserve model capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01442v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Governance at the Edge of Architecture: Regulating NeuroAI and Neuromorphic Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01503</link><description>arXiv:2602.01503v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as an effective approach for bootstrapping sequential decision-making in robotics, achieving strong performance even in high-dimensional dexterous manipulation tasks. Recent behavior cloning methods further leverage expressive generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching, to represent multimodal action distributions. However, policies pretrained in this manner often exhibit limited generalization and require additional fine-tuning to achieve robust performance at deployment time. Such adaptation must preserve the global exploration benefits of pretraining while enabling rapid correction of local execution errors. We propose Residual Flow Steering(RFS), a data-efficient reinforcement learning framework for adapting pretrained generative policies. RFS steers a pretrained flow-matching policy by jointly optimizing a residual action and a latent noise distribution, enabling complementary forms of exploration: local refinement through residual corrections and global exploration through latent-space modulation. This design allows efficient adaptation while retaining the expressive structure of the pretrained policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RFS on dexterous manipulation tasks, showing efficient fine-tuning in both simulation and real-world settings when adapting pretrained base policies.

Abstract: R1-style LLMs have attracted growing attention for their capacity for self-reflection, yet the internal mechanisms underlying such behavior remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we anchor on the onset of reflection behavior and trace its layer-wise activation trajectory. Using the logit lens to read out token-level semantics, we uncover a structured progression: (i) Latent-control layers, where an approximate linear direction encodes the semantics of thinking budget; (ii) Semantic-pivot layers, where discourse-level cues, including turning-point and summarization cues, surface and dominate the probability mass; and (iii) Behavior-overt layers, where the likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens begins to rise until they become highly likely to be sampled. Moreover, our targeted interventions uncover a causal chain across these stages: prompt-level semantics modulate the projection of activations along latent-control directions, thereby inducing competition between turning-point and summarization cues in semantic-pivot layers, which in turn regulates the sampling likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens in behavior-overt layers. Collectively, our findings suggest a human-like meta-cognitive process-progressing from latent monitoring, to discourse-level regulation, and to finally overt self-reflection.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is the primary mechanism for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks; however, standard approaches largely optimize task objectives in isolation and do not account for secondary yet critical alignment objectives (e.g., safety and hallucination avoidance). As a result, downstream fine-tuning can degrade alignment and fail to correct pre-existing misaligned behavior. We propose an alignment-aware fine-tuning framework that integrates feedback from an external alignment signal through policy-gradient-based regularization. Our method introduces an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically balances supervised and alignment-driven gradients on a per-sample basis, prioritizing uncertain or misaligned cases while allowing well-aligned examples to follow standard supervised updates. The framework further learns abstention behavior for fully misaligned inputs, incorporating conservative responses directly into the fine-tuned model. Experiments on general and domain-specific instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate consistent reductions in harmful and hallucinated outputs without sacrificing downstream task performance. Additional analyses show robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, prompt-based attacks, and unsafe initializations, establishing adaptively gated alignment optimization as an effective approach for alignment-preserving and alignment-recovering model adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02258v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ProphetKV: User-Query-Driven Selective Recomputation for Efficient KV Cache Reuse in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02579</link><description>arXiv:2602.02579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prefill stage of long-context Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is severely bottlenecked by computational overhead. To mitigate this, recent methods assemble pre-calculated KV caches of retrieved RAG documents (by a user query) and reprocess selected tokens to recover cross-attention between these pre-calculated KV caches. However, we identify a fundamental "crowding-out effect" in current token selection criteria: globally salient but user-query-irrelevant tokens saturate the limited recomputation budget, displacing the tokens truly essential for answering the user query and degrading inference accuracy.
  We propose ProphetKV, a user-query-driven KV Cache reuse method for RAG scenarios. ProphetKV dynamically prioritizes tokens based on their semantic relevance to the user query and employs a dual-stage recomputation pipeline to fuse layer-wise attention metrics into a high-utility set. By ensuring the recomputation budget is dedicated to bridging the informational gap between retrieved context and the user query, ProphetKV achieves high-fidelity attention recovery with minimal overhead. Our extensive evaluation results show that ProphetKV retains 96%-101% of full-prefill accuracy with only a 20% recomputation ratio, while achieving accuracy improvements of 8.8%-24.9% on RULER and 18.6%-50.9% on LongBench over the state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., CacheBlend, EPIC, and KVShare).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02579v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Silicon-Based Societies: An Early Study of the Moltbook Agent Community</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02613</link><description>arXiv:2602.02613v2 Announce Type: replace

At the time of study, Moltbook hosted over 150,000 registered autonomous agents operating across thousands of agent-created sub-communities. Using programmatic and non-intrusive data acquisition, we collected and analyzed the textual descriptions of 12,758 submolts, which represent proactive sub-community partitioning activities within the ecosystem. Treating agent-authored descriptions as first-class observational artifacts, we apply rigorous preprocessing, contextual embedding, and unsupervised clustering techniques to uncover latent patterns of thematic organization and social space structuring. The results show that autonomous agents systematically organize collective space through reproducible patterns spanning human-mimetic interests, silicon-centric self-reflection, and early-stage economic and coordination behaviors. Rather than relying on predefined sociological taxonomies, these structures emerge directly from machine-generated data traces. This work establishes a methodological foundation for data-driven silicon sociology and demonstrates that data mining techniques can provide a powerful lens for understanding the organization and evolution of large autonomous agent societies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02613v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Study of Adaptive Modeling Towards Robust Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02780</link><description>arXiv:2602.02780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support reasoning over biomolecular structures, but most existing approaches remain modality-specific and rely on either sequence-style encodings or fixed-length connector tokens for structural inputs. These designs can under-expose explicit geometric cues and impose rigid fusion bottlenecks, leading to over-compression and poor token allocation as structural complexity grows. We present a unified all-atom framework that grounds language reasoning in geometric information while adaptively scaling structural tokens. The method first constructs variable-size structural patches on molecular graphs using an instruction-conditioned gating policy, enabling complexity-aware allocation of query tokens. It then refines the resulting patch tokens via cross-attention with modality embeddings and injects geometry-informed tokens into the language model to improve structure grounding and reduce structural hallucinations. Across diverse all-atom benchmarks, the proposed approach yields consistent gains in heterogeneous structure-grounded reasoning. An anonymized implementation is provided in the supplementary material.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02780v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Membership Inference Attacks from Causal Principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02819</link><description>arXiv:2602.02819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used to quantify training data memorization and assess privacy risks. Standard evaluation requires repeated retraining, which is computationally costly for large models. One-run methods (single training with randomized data inclusion) and zero-run methods (post hoc evaluation) are often used instead, though their statistical validity remains unclear. To address this gap, we frame MIA evaluation as a causal inference problem, defining memorization as the causal effect of including a data point in the training set. This novel formulation reveals and formalizes key sources of bias in existing protocols: one-run methods suffer from interference between jointly included points, while zero-run evaluations popular for LLMs are confounded by non-random membership assignment. We derive causal analogues of standard MIA metrics and propose practical estimators for multi-run, one-run, and zero-run regimes with non-asymptotic consistency guarantees. Experiments on real-world data show that our approach enables reliable memorization measurement even when retraining is impractical and under distribution shift, providing a principled foundation for privacy evaluation in modern AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02819v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KANFIS: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Interpretable and Uncertainty-Aware Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03034</link><description>arXiv:2602.03034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was designed to combine the learning capabilities of neural network with the reasoning transparency of fuzzy logic. However, conventional ANFIS architectures suffer from structural complexity, where the product-based inference mechanism causes an exponential explosion of rules in high-dimensional spaces. We herein propose the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (KANFIS), a compact neuro-symbolic architecture that unifies fuzzy reasoning with additive function decomposition. KANFIS employs an additive aggregation mechanism, under which both model parameters and rule complexity scale linearly with input dimensionality rather than exponentially. Furthermore, KANFIS is compatible with both Type-1 (T1) and Interval Type-2 (IT2) fuzzy logic systems, enabling explicit modeling of uncertainty and ambiguity in fuzzy representations. By using sparse masking mechanisms, KANFIS generates compact and structured rule sets, resulting in an intrinsically interpretable model with clear rule semantics and transparent inference processes. Empirical results demonstrate that KANFIS achieves competitive performance against representative neural and neuro-fuzzy baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03034v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HP-GAN: Harnessing pretrained networks for GAN improvement with FakeTwins and discriminator consistency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03039</link><description>arXiv:2602.03039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made significant progress in enhancing the quality of image synthesis. Recent methods frequently leverage pretrained networks to calculate perceptual losses or utilize pretrained feature spaces. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of pretrained networks by incorporating innovative self-supervised learning techniques and enforcing consistency between discriminators during GAN training. Our proposed method, named HP-GAN, effectively exploits neural network priors through two primary strategies: FakeTwins and discriminator consistency. FakeTwins leverages pretrained networks as encoders to compute a self-supervised loss and applies this through the generated images to train the generator, thereby enabling the generation of more diverse and high quality images. Additionally, we introduce a consistency mechanism between discriminators that evaluate feature maps extracted from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) feature networks. Discriminator consistency promotes coherent learning among discriminators and enhances training robustness by aligning their assessments of image quality. Our extensive evaluation across seventeen datasets-including scenarios with large, small, and limited data, and covering a variety of image domains-demonstrates that HP-GAN consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), achieving significant improvements in image diversity and quality.

Abstract: Growing renewable penetration introduces substantial uncertainty into power system operations, necessitating frequent adaptation of dispatch objectives and constraints and challenging expertise-intensive, near-real-time modeling workflows. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for automating this process by translating natural-language (NL) operational requirements into executable optimization models via semantic reasoning and code synthesis. Yet existing LLM datasets and benchmarks for optimization modeling primarily target coarse-grained cross-domain generalization, offering limited, rigorous evaluation in power-system settings, particularly for Optimal Power Flow (OPF). We therefore introduce \textbf{ProOPF-D} and \textbf{ProOPF-B}, a dataset and benchmark for professional-grade OPF modeling: ProOPF-D contains 12K instances pairing NL requests with parameter adjustments and structural extensions to a canonical OPF, together with executable implementations; ProOPF-B provides 121 expert-annotated test cases with ground-truth code, enabling end-to-end evaluation under both concrete and abstract OPF modeling regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03070v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Short Chains, Deep Thoughts: Balancing Reasoning Efficiency and Intra-Segment Capability via Split-Merge Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03141</link><description>arXiv:2602.03141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks through the generation of long reasoning chains, this reliance on verbose generation results in significant latency and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{CoSMo} (\textbf{Co}nsistency-Guided \textbf{S}plit-\textbf{M}erge \textbf{O}ptimization), a framework designed to eliminate structural redundancy rather than indiscriminately restricting token volume. Specifically, CoSMo utilizes a split-merge algorithm that dynamically refines reasoning chains by merging redundant segments and splitting logical gaps to ensure coherence. We then employ structure-aligned reinforcement learning with a novel segment-level budget to supervise the model in maintaining efficient reasoning structures throughout training. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoSMo achieves superior performance, improving accuracy by \textbf{3.3} points while reducing segment usage by \textbf{28.7\%} on average compared to reasoning efficiency baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03141v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FASA: Frequency-aware Sparse Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03152</link><description>arXiv:2602.03152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical bottleneck when handling lengthy inputs: the prohibitive memory footprint of the Key Value (KV) cache. To address this bottleneck, the token pruning paradigm leverages attention sparsity to selectively retain a small, critical subset of tokens. However, existing approaches fall short, with static methods risking irreversible information loss and dynamic strategies employing heuristics that insufficiently capture the query-dependent nature of token importance. We propose FASA, a novel framework that achieves query-aware token eviction by dynamically predicting token importance. FASA stems from a novel insight into RoPE: the discovery of functional sparsity at the frequency-chunk (FC) level. Our key finding is that a small, identifiable subset of "dominant" FCs consistently exhibits high contextual agreement with the full attention head. This provides a robust and computationally free proxy for identifying salient tokens. Building on this insight, FASA first identifies a critical set of tokens using dominant FCs, and then performs focused attention computation solely on this pruned subset. Across a spectrum of long-context tasks, from sequence modeling to complex CoT reasoning, FASA consistently outperforms all token-eviction baselines and achieves near-oracle accuracy, demonstrating remarkable robustness even under constraint budgets. Notably, on LongBench-V1, FASA reaches nearly 100\% of full-KV performance when only keeping 256 tokens, and achieves 2.56$\times$ speedup using just 18.9\% of the cache on AIME24.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03152v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prompt Augmentation Scales up GRPO Training on Mathematical Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03190</link><description>arXiv:2602.03190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated strong potential for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, prior work has consistently observed an entropy collapse phenomenon during reinforcement post-training, characterized by a monotonic decrease in policy entropy that ultimately leads to training instability and collapse. As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity. We show that, without a KL regularization term, prompt augmentation enables stable scaling of training duration under a fixed dataset and allows the model to tolerate low-entropy regimes without premature collapse. Empirically, a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on the MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 45.2 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.8 per-question accuracy on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench.

Abstract: Inverse design with physics-based objectives is challenging because it couples high-dimensional geometry with expensive simulations, as exemplified by aerodynamic shape optimization for drag reduction. We revisit inverse design through two canonical solutions, the optimal design point and the optimal design distribution, and relate them to optimization and guided generation. Building on this view, we propose a new training loss for cost predictors and a density-gradient optimization method that improves objectives while preserving plausible shapes. We further unify existing training-free guided generation methods. To address their inability to approximate conditional covariance in high dimensions, we develop a time- and memory-efficient algorithm for approximate covariance estimation. Experiments on a controlled 2D study and high-fidelity 3D aerodynamic benchmarks (car and aircraft), validated by OpenFOAM simulations and miniature wind-tunnel tests with 3D-printed prototypes, demonstrate consistent gains in both optimization and guided generation. Additional offline RL results further support the generality of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03582v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Conversational Inertia in Multi-Turn Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03664</link><description>arXiv:2602.03664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models excel as few-shot learners when provided with appropriate demonstrations, yet this strength becomes problematic in multiturn agent scenarios, where LLMs erroneously mimic their own previous responses as few-shot examples. Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario validate that our framework reduces conversational inertia and achieves performance improvements.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03664v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PaperX: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Academic Presentation Generation with Scholar DAG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03866</link><description>arXiv:2602.03866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transforming scientific papers into multimodal presentation content is essential for research dissemination but remains labor intensive.

We introduce PaperX, a unified framework that models academic presentation generation as a structural transformation and rendering process. Central to our approach is the Scholar DAG, an intermediate representation that decouples the paper's logical structure from its final presentation syntax. By applying adaptive graph traversal strategies, PaperX generates diverse, high quality outputs from a single source. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves the state of the art performance in content fidelity and aesthetic quality while significantly improving cost efficiency compared to specialized single task agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03866v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reversible Deep Learning for 13C NMR in Chemoinformatics: On Structures and Spectra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03875</link><description>arXiv:2602.03875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a reversible deep learning model for 13C NMR that uses a single conditional invertible neural network for both directions between molecular structures and spectra. The network is built from i-RevNet style bijective blocks, so the forward map and its inverse are available by construction. We train the model to predict a 128-bit binned spectrum code from a graph-based structure encoding, while the remaining latent dimensions capture residual variability. At inference time, we invert the same trained network to generate structure candidates from a spectrum code, which explicitly represents the one-to-many nature of spectrum-to-structure inference. On a filtered subset, the model is numerically invertible on trained examples, achieves spectrum-code prediction above chance, and produces coarse but meaningful structural signals when inverted on validation spectra. These results demonstrate that invertible architectures can unify spectrum prediction and uncertainty-aware candidate generation within one end-to-end model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03875v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Representation Geometry as a Diagnostic for Out-of-Distribution Robustness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03951</link><description>arXiv:2602.03951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains difficult to monitor and optimize in the absence of target-domain labels, as models with similar in-distribution accuracy can exhibit markedly different out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics. Our results demonstrate that representation geometry enables interpretable, label-free robustness diagnosis and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03951v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] JSynFlow: Japanese Synthesised Flowchart Visual Question Answering Dataset built with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04142</link><description>arXiv:2602.04142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision and language models (VLMs) are expected to analyse complex documents, such as those containing flowcharts, through a question-answering (QA) interface. The ability to recognise and interpret these flowcharts is in high demand, as they provide valuable insights unavailable in text-only explanations. However, developing VLMs with precise flowchart understanding requires large-scale datasets of flowchart images and corresponding text, the creation of which is highly time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce JSynFlow, a synthesised visual QA dataset for Japanese flowcharts, generated using large language models (LLMs). Our dataset comprises task descriptions for various business occupations, the corresponding flowchart images rendered from domain-specific language (DSL) code, and related QA pairs. This paper details the dataset's synthesis procedure and demonstrates that fine-tuning with JSynFlow significantly improves VLM performance on flowchart-based QA tasks. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jri-advtechlab/jsynflow.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04142v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training Data Efficiency in Multimodal Process Reward Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04145</link><description>arXiv:2602.04145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) are central to step-level supervision for visual reasoning in MLLMs. Training MPRMs typically requires large-scale Monte Carlo (MC)-annotated corpora, incurring substantial training cost. This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training. Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora. To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04145v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Separation-Utility Pareto Frontier: An Information-Theoretic Characterization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04408</link><description>arXiv:2602.04408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Pareto frontier (optimal trade-off) between utility and separation, a fairness criterion requiring predictive independence from sensitive attributes conditional on the true outcome. Through an information-theoretic lens, we prove a characterization of the utility-separation Pareto frontier, establish its concavity, and thereby prove the increasing marginal cost of separation in terms of utility. In addition, we characterize the conditions under which this trade-off becomes strict, providing a guide for trade-off selection in practice. Based on the theoretical characterization, we develop an empirical regularizer based on conditional mutual information (CMI) between predictions and sensitive attributes given the true outcome. The CMI regularizer is compatible with any deep model trained via gradient-based optimization and serves as a scalar monitor of residual separation violations, offering tractable guarantees during training. Finally, numerical experiments support our theoretical findings: across COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, and CelebA, the proposed method substantially reduces separation violations while matching or exceeding the utility of established baseline methods. This study thus offers a provable, stable, and flexible approach to enforcing separation in deep learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04408v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HoRD: Robust Humanoid Control via History-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning and Online Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04412</link><description>arXiv:2602.04412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid robots can suffer significant performance drops under small changes in dynamics, task specifications, or environment setup. We propose HoRD, a two-stage learning framework for robust humanoid control under domain shift. First, we train a high-performance teacher policy via history-conditioned reinforcement learning, where the policy infers latent dynamics context from recent state--action trajectories to adapt online to diverse randomized dynamics. Second, we perform online distillation to transfer the teacher's robust control capabilities into a transformer-based student policy that operates on sparse root-relative 3D joint keypoint trajectories. By combining history-conditioned adaptation with online distillation, HoRD enables a single policy to adapt zero-shot to unseen domains without per-domain retraining. Extensive experiments show HoRD outperforms strong baselines in robustness and transfer, especially under unseen domains and external perturbations.

Abstract: Feed-forward multi-frame 3D reconstruction models often degrade on videos with object motion. Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04439v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SDR-CIR: Semantic Debias Retrieval Framework for Training-Free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04451</link><description>arXiv:2602.04451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve a target image from a query composed of a reference image and modification text. Recent training-free zero-shot methods often employ Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to compose a target image description for retrieval. However, due to the fuzzy matching nature of ZS-CIR, the generated description is prone to semantic bias relative to the target image. We propose SDR-CIR, a training-free Semantic Debias Ranking method based on CoT reasoning. First, Selective CoT guides the MLLM to extract visual content relevant to the modification text during image understanding, thereby reducing visual noise at the source. We then introduce a Semantic Debias Ranking with two steps, Anchor and Debias, to mitigate semantic bias. In the Anchor step, we fuse reference image features with target description features to reinforce useful semantics and supplement omitted cues. In the Debias step, we explicitly model the visual semantic contribution of the reference image to the description and incorporate it into the similarity score as a penalty term. By supplementing omitted cues while suppressing redundancy, SDR-CIR mitigates semantic bias and improves retrieval performance. Experiments on three standard CIR benchmarks show that SDR-CIR achieves state-of-the-art results among one-stage methods while maintaining high efficiency. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/suny105/SDR-CIR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04451v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TACO: Temporal Consensus Optimization for Continual Neural Mapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04516</link><description>arXiv:2602.04516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural implicit mapping has emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic navigation and scene understanding. However, real-world robotic deployment requires continual adaptation to changing environments under strict memory and computation constraints, which existing mapping systems fail to support. Most prior methods rely on replaying historical observations to preserve consistency and assume static scenes. As a result, they cannot adapt to continual learning in dynamic robotic settings. To address these challenges, we propose TACO (TemporAl Consensus Optimization), a replay-free framework for continual neural mapping. We reformulate mapping as a temporal consensus optimization problem, where we treat past model snapshots as temporal neighbors. Intuitively, our approach resembles a model consulting its own past knowledge. We update the current map by enforcing weighted consensus with historical representations. Our method allows reliable past geometry to constrain optimization while permitting unreliable or outdated regions to be revised in response to new observations. TACO achieves a balance between memory efficiency and adaptability without storing or replaying previous data.

Abstract: For the past decade, the trajectory of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated by a model-centric paradigm driven by scaling laws. Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.
  Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04575v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inference-Time Backdoors via Hidden Instructions in LLM Chat Templates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04653</link><description>arXiv:2602.04653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-weight language models are increasingly used in production settings, raising new security challenges. One prominent threat in this context is backdoor attacks, in which adversaries embed hidden behaviors in language models that activate under specific conditions. Previous work has assumed that adversaries have access to training pipelines or deployment infrastructure. We propose a novel attack surface requiring neither, which utilizes the chat template. Chat templates are executable Jinja2 programs invoked at every inference call, occupying a privileged position between user input and model processing. We show that an adversary who distributes a model with a maliciously modified template can implant an inference-time backdoor without modifying model weights, poisoning training data, or controlling runtime infrastructure. We evaluated this attack vector by constructing template backdoors targeting two objectives: degrading factual accuracy and inducing emission of attacker-controlled URLs, and applied them across eighteen models spanning seven families and four inference engines. Under triggered conditions, factual accuracy drops from 90% to 15% on average while attacker-controlled URLs are emitted with success rates exceeding 80%; benign inputs show no measurable degradation. Backdoors generalize across inference runtimes and evade all automated security scans applied by the largest open-weight distribution platform. These results establish chat templates as a reliable and currently undefended attack surface in the LLM supply chain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04653v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PIO-FVLM: Rethinking Training-Free Visual Token Reduction for VLM Acceleration from an Inference-Objective Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04657</link><description>arXiv:2602.04657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, reducing redundant visual tokens in vision-language models (VLMs) to accelerate VLM inference has emerged as a hot topic. However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead.

Abstract: We study two foundational problems in audio language models: (1) how to design an audio tokenizer that can serve as an intermediate representation for both understanding and generation; and (2) how to build an audio foundation model that generalizes in few-shot and zero-shot settings, analogous to large language models. To this end, we make the following two contributions. First, we propose ReasoningCodec, a discrete audio codec that factorizes audio into (i) reasoning tokens, which encode text-aligned, high-level analysis and planning representations for audio understanding and hierarchical generation, and (ii) reconstruction tokens, which encode semantic-rich acoustic cues for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. This design achieves understanding performance comparable to strong continuous representations while improving generation quality and reconstruction fidelity over prior discrete tokenizers. Second, we introduce a unified autoregressive architecture for text and audio, together with multi-stage training and multi-task data construction. Using this framework, we train UniAudio 2.0 on 100B text tokens and 60B audio tokens. Across a wide range of speech, sound, and music tasks, UniAudio 2.0 performs competitively on in-domain evaluations and demonstrates strong few-shot and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a highly effective paradigm for keeping LLM-based responses up-to-date and reducing the likelihood of hallucinations. Yet, RAG was recently shown to be quite vulnerable to corpus knowledge poisoning: an attacker injects misleading documents to the corpus to steer an LLM's output to an undesired response. We argue that the standard causal attention mechanism in LLMs enables harmful cross-document interactions, specifically in cases of attacks. Accordingly, we introduce a novel defense approach for RAG: Sparse Document Attention RAG (SDAG). This is a block-sparse attention mechanism that disallows cross-attention between retrieved documents. SDAG requires a minimal inference-time change to the attention mask; furthermore, no fine-tuning or additional architectural changes are needed. We present an empirical evaluation of LLM-based question answering (QA) with a variety of attack strategies on RAG. We show that our SDAG method substantially outperforms the standard causal attention mechanism in terms of attack success rate. We further demonstrate the clear merits of integrating SDAG with state-of-the-art RAG defense methods. Specifically, the integration results in performance that is statistically significantly better than the state-of-the-art.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04711v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dull, Dirty, Dangerous: Understanding the Past, Present, and Future of a Key Motivation for Robotics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04746</link><description>arXiv:2602.04746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In robotics, the concept of "dull, dirty, and dangerous" (DDD) work has been used to motivate where robots might be useful. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of robotics publications between 1980 and 2024 that mention DDD, and find that only 2.7% of publications define DDD and 8.7% of publications provide concrete examples of tasks or jobs that are DDD. We then review the social science literature on "dull," "dirty," and "dangerous" work to provide definitions and guidance on how to conceptualize DDD for robotics. Finally, we propose a framework that helps the robotics community consider the job context for our technology, encouraging a more informed perspective on how robotics may impact human labor.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04746v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Maximum-Volume Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04795</link><description>arXiv:2602.04795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04795v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Horizon-LM: A RAM-Centric Architecture for LLM Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04816</link><description>arXiv:2602.04816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2$\times$ higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04816v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoT is Not the Chain of Truth: An Empirical Internal Analysis of Reasoning LLMs for Fake News Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04856</link><description>arXiv:2602.04856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From generating headlines to fabricating news, the Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically assessed by their final outputs, under the safety assumption that a refusal response signifies safe reasoning throughout the entire process. Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04856v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improved Generalization Bounds for Transductive Learning by Transductive Local Complexity and Its Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16858</link><description>arXiv:2309.16858v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Transductive Local Complexity (TLC) to extend the classical Local Rademacher Complexity (LRC) to the transductive setting, incorporating substantial and novel components. Although LRC has been used to obtain sharp generalization bounds and minimax rates for inductive tasks such as classification and nonparametric regression, it has remained an open problem whether a localized Rademacher complexity framework can be effectively adapted to transductive learning to achieve sharp or nearly sharp bounds consistent with inductive results. We provide an affirmative answer via TLC. TLC is constructed by first deriving a new concentration inequality in Theorem 4.1 for the supremum of empirical processes capturing the gap between test and training losses, termed the test-train process, under uniform sampling without replacement, which leverages a novel combinatorial property of the test-train process and a new proof strategy applying the exponential Efron-Stein inequality twice. A subsequent peeling strategy applied to a new decomposition of the expectation of the test-train process and a new surrogate variance operator then yield excess risk bounds in the transductive setting that are nearly consistent with classical LRC-based inductive bounds up to a logarithmic gap. We further advance transductive learning through two applications: (1) for realizable transductive learning over binary-valued classes with finite VC dimension of $\dVC$ and $u \ge m \ge \dVC$, where $u$ and $m$ are the number of test features and training features, our Theorem 6.1 gives a nearly optimal bound $\Theta(\dVC \log(me/\dVC)/m)$ matching the minimax rate $\Theta(\dVC/m)$ up to $\log m$, resolving a decade-old open question; and (2) Theorem 6.2 presents a sharper excess risk bound for transductive kernel learning compared to the current state-of-the-art.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2309.16858v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARM: Refining Multivariate Forecasting with Adaptive Temporal-Contextual Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09488</link><description>arXiv:2310.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is important for various domains but is confronted by challenges in handling the complex temporal-contextual relationships. As multivariate input models underperforming some recent univariate counterparts, we posit that the issue lies in the inefficiency of existing multivariate LTSF Transformers to model series-wise relationships: the characteristic differences between series are often captured incorrectly. To address this, we introduce ARM: a multivariate temporal-contextual adaptive learning method, which is an enhanced architecture specifically designed for multivariate LTSF modelling. ARM employs Adaptive Univariate Effect Learning (AUEL), Random Dropping (RD) training strategy, and Multi-kernel Local Smoothing (MKLS), to better handle individual series temporal patterns and correctly learn inter-series dependencies. ARM demonstrates superior performance on multiple benchmarks without significantly increasing computational costs compared to vanilla Transformer, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in LTSF. ARM is also generally applicable to other LTSF architecture beyond vanilla Transformer.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2310.09488v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CATS: Enhancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting by Constructing Auxiliary Time Series as Exogenous Variables</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01673</link><description>arXiv:2403.01673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

Key principles of ATS - continuity, sparsity, and variability - are identified and implemented through different modules. Even with a basic 2-layer MLP as core predictor, CATS achieves state-of-the-art, significantly reducing complexity and parameters compared to previous multivariate models, marking it an efficient and transferable MTSF solution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2403.01673v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Root Cause Analysis of Outliers with Missing Structural Knowledge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05014</link><description>arXiv:2406.05014v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is to explain why an anomaly occurred by identifying where the fault originated. Several recent works model the anomalous event as resulting from a change in the causal mechanism at the root cause, i.e., as a soft intervention. RCA is then the task of identifying which causal mechanism changed. In real-world applications, one often has either few or only a single sample from the post-intervention distribution: a severe limitation for most methods, which assume one knows or can estimate the distribution. However, even those that do not are statistically ill-posed due to the need to probe regression models in regions of low probability density. In this paper, we propose simple, efficient methods to overcome both difficulties in the case where there is a single root cause and the causal graph is a polytree. When one knows the causal graph, we give guarantees for a traversal algorithm that requires only marginal anomaly scores and does not depend on specifying an arbitrary anomaly score cut-off. When one does not know the causal graph, we show that the heuristic of identifying root causes as the variables with the highest marginal anomaly scores is causally justified. To this end, we prove that anomalies with small scores are unlikely to cause those with larger scores in polytrees and give upper bounds for the likelihood of causal pathways with non-monotonic anomaly scores.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.05014v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating S-Band Interference: Impact of Satellite Systems on Terrestrial Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11717</link><description>arXiv:2408.11717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The co-existence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) is essential for achieving global coverage in sixth-generation cellular networks.

This paper analyzes the interference caused by satellite networks on TN in the S-band. We examined the transmission mechanisms of satellite signals and conducted simulations to evaluate interference intensity across varying slant ranges. Our findings indicate that the angle between the user equipment direction and the sub-satellite point direction from the beam center significantly impacts the interference level.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.11717v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conditional regression for the Nonlinear Single-Variable Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09686</link><description>arXiv:2411.09686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regressing a function $F$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ without the statistical and computational curse of dimensionality requires special statistical models, for example that impose geometric assumptions on the distribution of the data (e.g., that its support is low-dimensional), or strong smoothness assumptions on $F$, or a special structure $F$. Among the latter, compositional models $F=f\circ g$ with $g$ mapping to $\mathbb{R}^r$ with $r\ll d$ include classical single- and multi-index models, as well as neural networks. While the case where $g$ is linear is well-understood, less is known when $g$ is nonlinear, and in particular for which $g$'s the curse of dimensionality in estimating $F$, or both $f$ and $g$, may be circumvented. Here we consider a model $F(X):=f(\Pi_\gamma X)$ where $\Pi_\gamma:\mathbb{R}^d\to[0,\textrm{len}_\gamma]$ is the closest-point projection onto the parameter of a regular curve $\gamma:[0, \textrm{len}_\gamma]\to\mathbb{R}^d$, and $f:[0,\textrm{len}_\gamma]\to \mathbb{R}^1$. The input data $X$ is not low-dimensional: it can be as far from $\gamma$ as the condition that $\Pi_\gamma(X)$ is well-defined allows. The distribution $X$, the curve $\gamma$ and the function $f$ are all unknown. This model is a natural nonlinear generalization of the single-index model, corresponding to $\gamma$ being a line. We propose a nonparametric estimator, based on conditional regression, that under suitable assumptions, the strongest of which being that $f$ is coarsely monotone, achieves, up to log factors, the $\textit{one-dimensional}$ optimal min-max rate for non-parametric regression, up to the level of noise in the observations, and be constructed in time $\mathcal{O}(d^2 n\log n)$. All the constants in the learning bounds, in the minimal number of samples required for our bounds to hold, and in the computational complexity are at most low-order polynomials in $d$.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.09686v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A physics-based data-driven model for CO$_2$ gas diffusion electrodes to drive automated laboratories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06323</link><description>arXiv:2502.06323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrochemical reduction of atmospheric CO$_2$ into high-energy molecules with renewable energy is a promising avenue for energy storage that can take advantage of existing infrastructure especially in areas where sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels do not exist. Automated laboratories are currently being developed and used to optimize the composition and operating conditions of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), the device in which this reaction takes place. Improving the efficiency of GDEs is crucial for this technology to become viable. Here we present a modeling framework to efficiently explore the high-dimensional parameter space of GDE designs in an active learning context. At the core of the framework is an uncertainty-aware physics model calibrated with experimental data. The model has the flexibility to capture various input parameter spaces and any carbon products which can be modeled with Tafel kinetics. It is interpretable, and a Gaussian process layer can capture deviations of real data from the function space of the physical model itself. We deploy the model in a simulated active learning setup with real electrochemical data gathered by the AdaCarbon automated laboratory and show that it can be used to efficiently traverse the multi-dimensional parameter space.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.06323v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transformer brain encoders explain human high-level visual responses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17329</link><description>arXiv:2505.17329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major goal of neuroscience is to understand brain computations during visual processing in naturalistic settings. A dominant approach is to use image-computable deep neural networks trained with different task objectives as a basis for linear encoding models. However, in addition to requiring estimation of a large number of linear encoding parameters, this approach ignores the structure of the feature maps both in the brain and the models. Recently proposed alternatives factor the linear mapping into separate sets of spatial and feature weights, thus finding static receptive fields for units, which is appropriate only for early visual areas. In this work, we employ the attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture to study how retinotopic visual features can be dynamically routed to category-selective areas in high-level visual processing. We show that this computational motif is significantly more powerful than alternative methods in predicting brain activity during natural scene viewing, across different feature basis models and modalities. We also show that this approach is inherently more interpretable as the attention-routing signals for different high-level categorical areas can be easily visualized for any input image. Given its high performance at predicting brain responses to novel images, the model deserves consideration as a candidate mechanistic model of how visual information from retinotopic maps is routed in the human brain based on the relevance of the input content to different category-selective regions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.17329v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Contrastive Learning Foundation Model Based on Perfectly Aligned Sample Pairs for Remote Sensing Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19447</link><description>arXiv:2505.19447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL) methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically, PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks to augmented images rather than random cropping. Our framework provides high-quality features by ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its sparse inputs. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrates remarkable adaptability to uncurated RS data and reduce the impact of the potential semantic inconsistency. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work will contribute to practical remote sensing interpretation works.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.19447v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PolarGrad: A Class of Matrix-Gradient Optimizers from a Unifying Preconditioning Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21799</link><description>arXiv:2505.21799v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ever-growing scale of deep learning models and training data underscores the critical importance of efficient optimization methods. While preconditioned gradient methods such as Adam and AdamW are the de facto optimizers for training neural networks and large language models, structure-aware preconditioned optimizers like Shampoo and Muon, which utilize the matrix structure of gradients, have demonstrated promising evidence of faster convergence. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework for analyzing "matrix-aware" preconditioned methods, which not only sheds light on the effectiveness of Muon and related optimizers but also leads to a class of new structure-aware preconditioned methods. A key contribution of this framework is its precise distinction between preconditioning strategies that treat neural network weights as vectors (addressing curvature anisotropy) versus those that consider their matrix structure (addressing gradient anisotropy). This perspective provides new insights into several empirical phenomena in language model pre-training, including Adam's training instabilities, Muon's accelerated convergence, and the necessity of learning rate warmup for Adam. Building upon this framework, we introduce PolarGrad, a new class of preconditioned optimization methods based on the polar decomposition of matrix-valued gradients. As a special instance, PolarGrad includes Muon with updates scaled by the nuclear norm of the gradients. We provide numerical implementations of these methods, leveraging efficient numerical polar decomposition algorithms for enhanced convergence. Our extensive evaluations across diverse matrix optimization problems and language model pre-training tasks demonstrate that PolarGrad outperforms both Adam and Muon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.21799v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Plug-and-play linear attention with provable guarantees for training-free image restoration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08520</link><description>arXiv:2506.08520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) is a key building block in modern vision Transformers, yet its quadratic complexity in the number of tokens remains a major bottleneck for real-time and resource-constrained deployment. We present PnP-Nystra, a training-free Nystr\"{o}m-based linear attention module designed as a plug-and-play replacement for MHSA in {pretrained} image restoration Transformers, with provable kernel approximation error guarantees. PnP-Nystra integrates directly into window-based architectures such as SwinIR, Uformer, and Dehazeformer, yielding efficient inference without finetuning. Across denoising, deblurring, dehazing, and super-resolution on images, PnP-Nystra delivers $1.8$--$3.6\times$ speedups on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU and $1.8$--$7\times$ speedups on CPU inference. Compared with the strongest training-free linear-attention baselines we evaluate, our method incurs the smallest quality drop and stays closest to the original model's outputs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.08520v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14665</link><description>arXiv:2506.14665v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.14665v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Segmentation-free Goodness of Pronunciation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16838</link><description>arXiv:2507.16838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) is a significant part in modern computer-aided language learning (CALL) systems. Most systems implementing phoneme-level MDD through goodness of pronunciation (GOP), however, rely on pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic units. This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use modern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first propose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR models for MDD. Next, we define a more general segmentation-free method that takes all possible segmentations of the canonical transcription into account (GOP-SF). We give a theoretical account of our definition of GOP-SF, an implementation that solves potential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which allows the use of acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We provide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and speechocean762 datasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the dependency of GOP-SF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount of context around the target phoneme. Finally, we compare our methods with recent studies over the speechocean762 data showing that the feature vectors derived from the proposed method achieve state-of-the-art results on phoneme-level pronunciation assessment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.16838v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improved SINR Approximation for Downlink SDMA-based Networks with Outdated Channel State Information</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09020</link><description>arXiv:2508.09020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the performance of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) remains a critical challenge in next-generation wireless networks. In this context, accurate statistical modeling of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is essential for enabling tractable performance analysis of multi-user systems. This paper presents an improved statistical approximation of the SINR for downlink (DL) MU-MIMO systems with imperfect CSIT. The proposed model retains the analytical simplicity of existing approaches (e.g., Gamma-based approximations) while overcoming their limitations, particularly the underestimation of SINR variance. We evaluate the proposed approximation in the context of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)-enabled MIMO DL systems with outdated CSIT. The results demonstrate excellent accuracy across a wide range of system configurations, including varying numbers of users, antennas, and degrees of CSIT staleness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.09020v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] YOLO-based Bearing Fault Diagnosis With Continuous Wavelet Transform</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03070</link><description>arXiv:2509.03070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a locality-aware bearing fault diagnosis framework that operates on time-frequency representations and enables spatially interpretable decision-making. One-dimensional vibration signals are first mapped to two-dimensional time-frequency spectrograms using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with Morlet wavelets to enhance transient fault signatures. The diagnosis task is then formulated as object detection on the time-frequency plane, where YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and YOLOv11 are employed to localize fault-relevant regions and classify fault types simultaneously. Experiments on three public benchmarks, including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU), and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), demonstrate strong cross-dataset generalization compared with a representative MCNN-LSTM baseline. In particular, YOLOv11 achieves mAP@0.5 of 99.0% (CWRU), 97.8% (PU), and 99.5% (IMS), while providing region-aware visualization of fault patterns in the time-frequency domain. These results suggest that detection-based inference on CWT spectrograms provides an effective and interpretable complementary approach to conventional global classification for rotating machinery condition monitoring.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.03070v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UniverSR: Unified and Versatile Audio Super-Resolution via Vocoder-Free Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00771</link><description>arXiv:2510.00771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a vocoder-free framework for audio super-resolution that employs a flow matching generative model to capture the conditional distribution of complex-valued spectral coefficients. Unlike conventional two-stage diffusion-based approaches that predict a mel-spectrogram and then rely on a pre-trained neural vocoder to synthesize waveforms, our method directly reconstructs waveforms via the inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform (iSTFT), thereby eliminating the dependence on a separate vocoder. This design not only simplifies end-to-end optimization but also overcomes a critical bottleneck of two-stage pipelines, where the final audio quality is fundamentally constrained by vocoder performance. Experiments show that our model consistently produces high-fidelity 48 kHz audio across diverse upsampling factors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both speech and general audio datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.00771v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Representer Theorem for Hawkes Processes via Penalized Least Squares Minimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08916</link><description>arXiv:2510.08916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The representer theorem is a cornerstone of kernel methods, which aim to estimate latent functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) in a nonparametric manner. Its significance lies in converting inherently infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional ones over dual coefficients, thereby enabling practical and computationally tractable algorithms. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the latent triggering kernels--functions that encode the interaction structure between events--for linear multivariate Hawkes processes based on observed event sequences within an RKHS framework. We show that, under the principle of penalized least squares minimization, a novel form of representer theorem emerges: a family of transformed kernels can be defined via a system of simultaneous integral equations, and the optimal estimator of each triggering kernel is expressed as a linear combination of these transformed kernels evaluated at the data points. Remarkably, the dual coefficients are all analytically fixed to unity, obviating the need to solve a costly optimization problem to obtain the dual coefficients. This leads to a highly efficient estimator capable of handling large-scale data more effectively than conventional nonparametric approaches. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets reveal that the proposed method attains competitive predictive accuracy while substantially improving computational efficiency over existing state-of-the-art kernel method-based estimators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08916v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Data Mixing Shapes In-Context Learning: Asymptotic Equivalence for Transformers with MLPs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25753</link><description>arXiv:2510.25753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained Transformers demonstrate remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them to adapt to new tasks from demonstrations without parameter updates. However, theoretical studies often rely on simplified architectures (e.g., omitting MLPs), plain data models (e.g., linear regression with isotropic inputs), and single-source training, limiting their relevance to realistic settings. In this work, we study ICL in pretrained Transformers with nonlinear MLP heads on nonlinear tasks drawn from multiple data sources with heterogeneous input, task, and noise distributions. We analyze a model where the MLP comprises two layers, with the first layer trained via a single gradient step and the second layer fully optimized. Under high-dimensional asymptotics, we prove that such models are equivalent in ICL error to structured polynomial predictors, leveraging results from the theory of Gaussian universality and orthogonal polynomials. This equivalence reveals that nonlinear MLPs meaningfully enhance ICL performance, particularly on nonlinear tasks, compared to linear baselines. It also enables a precise analysis of data mixing effects: we identify key properties of high-quality data sources (low noise, structured covariances) and show that feature learning emerges only when the task covariance exhibits sufficient structure. These results are validated empirically across various activation functions, model sizes, and data distributions. Finally, we experiment with a real-world scenario involving multilingual sentiment analysis where each language is treated as a different source. Our experimental results for this case exemplify how our findings extend to real-world cases. Overall, our work advances the theoretical foundations of ICL in Transformers and provides actionable insight into the role of architecture and data in ICL.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25753v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Networks Learn Generic Multi-Index Models Near Information-Theoretic Limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15120</link><description>arXiv:2511.15120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In deep learning, a central issue is to understand how neural networks efficiently learn high-dimensional features. To this end, we explore the gradient descent learning of a general Gaussian Multi-index model $f(\boldsymbol{x})=g(\boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{x})$ with hidden subspace $\boldsymbol{U}\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times d}$, which is the canonical setup to study representation learning. We prove that under generic non-degenerate assumptions on the link function, a standard two-layer neural network trained via layer-wise gradient descent can agnostically learn the target with $o_d(1)$ test error using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$ samples and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^2)$ time. The sample and time complexity both align with the information-theoretic limit up to leading order and are therefore optimal. During the first stage of gradient descent learning, the proof proceeds via showing that the inner weights can perform a power-iteration process. This process implicitly mimics a spectral start for the whole span of the hidden subspace and eventually eliminates finite-sample noise and recovers this span. It surprisingly indicates that optimal results can only be achieved if the first layer is trained for more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ steps. This work demonstrates the ability of neural networks to effectively learn hierarchical functions with respect to both sample and time efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.15120v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Local EGOP for Continuous Index Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07061</link><description>arXiv:2601.07061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the setting of continuous index learning, in which a function of many variables varies only along a small number of directions at each point. For efficient estimation, it is beneficial for a learning algorithm to adapt, near each point $x$, to the subspace that captures the local variability of the function $f$. We pose this task as kernel adaptation along a manifold with noise, and introduce Local EGOP learning, a recursive algorithm that utilizes the Expected Gradient Outer Product (EGOP) quadratic form as both a metric and inverse-covariance of our target distribution. We prove that Local EGOP learning adapts to the regularity of the function of interest, showing that under a supervised noisy manifold hypothesis, intrinsic dimensional learning rates are achieved for arbitrarily high-dimensional noise. Empirically, we compare our algorithm to the feature learning capabilities of deep learning. Additionally, we demonstrate improved regression quality compared to two-layer neural networks in the continuous single-index setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07061v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sample Complexity of Composite Quantum Hypothesis Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08588</link><description>arXiv:2601.08588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates symmetric composite binary quantum hypothesis testing (QHT), where the goal is to determine which of two uncertainty sets contains an unknown quantum state. While asymptotic error exponents for this problem are well-studied, the finite-sample regime remains poorly understood. We bridge this gap by characterizing the sample complexity -- the minimum number of state copies required to achieve a target error level. Specifically, we derive lower bounds that generalize the sample complexity of simple QHT and introduce new upper bounds for various uncertainty sets, including of both finite and infinite cardinalities. Notably, our upper and lower bounds match up to universal constants, providing a tight characterization of the sample complexity. Finally, we extend our analysis to the differentially private setting, establishing the sample complexity for privacy-preserving composite QHT.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08588v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact: extension to linear viscoelasticity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13818</link><description>arXiv:2601.13818v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the distributed rolling contact FrBD framework to linear viscoelasticity by considering classic derivative Generalised Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt rheological representations of the bristle element. With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects. The findings of this paper substantially advance the FrBD paradigm by enabling a unified and systematic treatment of linear viscoelasticity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13818v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stream-Voice-Anon: Enhancing Utility of Real-Time Speaker Anonymization via Neural Audio Codec and Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13948</link><description>arXiv:2601.13948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protecting speaker identity is crucial for online voice applications, yet streaming speaker anonymization (SA) remains underexplored. Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios. Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13948v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Audio Inpainting in Time-Frequency Domain with Phase-Aware Prior</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18535</link><description>arXiv:2601.18535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of time-frequency audio inpainting, where the goal is to fill missing spectrogram portions with reliable information. Despite recent advances, existing approaches still face limitations in both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a method that utilizes a phase-aware signal prior which exploits estimates of the instantaneous frequency. An optimization problem is formulated and solved using the generalized Chambolle-Pock algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated against other time-frequency inpainting methods, specifically a deep-prior audio inpainting neural network and the autoregression-based approach known as Janssen-TF. Our proposed approach surpassed these methods by a large margin in the objective evaluation as well as in the conducted subjective listening test, improving the state of the art. In addition, the reconstructions are obtained with a substantially reduced computational cost compared to alternative methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18535v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimized $k$-means color quantization of digital images in machine-based and human perception-based colorspaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19117</link><description>arXiv:2601.19117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color quantization represents an image using a fraction of its original number of colors while only minimally losing its visual quality. The $k$-means algorithm is commonly used in this context, but has mostly been applied in the machine-based RGB colorspace composed of the three primary colors. However, some recent studies have indicated its improved performance in human perception-based colorspaces. We investigated the performance of $k$-means color quantization at four quantization levels in the RGB, CIE-XYZ, and CIE-LUV/CIE-HCL colorspaces, on 148 varied digital images spanning a wide range of scenes, subjects and settings. The Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) measure numerically assessed the quality of the quantized images, and showed that in about half of the cases, $k$-means color quantization is best in the RGB space, while at other times, and especially for higher quantization levels ($k$), the CIE-XYZ colorspace is where it usually does better. There are also some cases, especially at lower $k$, where the best performance is obtained in the CIE-LUV colorspace. Further analysis of the performances in terms of the distributions of the hue, chromaticity and luminance in an image presents a nuanced perspective and characterization of the images for which each colorspace is better for $k$-means color quantization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19117v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Whitepaper Claims Predict Market Behavior?

Abstract: This study investigates whether cryptocurrency whitepaper narratives align with empirically observed market factor structure. We construct a pipeline combining zero-shot NLP classification of 38 whitepapers across 10 semantic categories with CP tensor decomposition of hourly market data (49 assets, 17,543 timestamps). Using Procrustes rotation and Tucker's congruence coefficient (phi), we find weak alignment between claims and market statistics (phi = 0.246, p = 0.339) and between claims and latent factors (phi = 0.058, p = 0.751). A methodological validation comparison (statistics versus factors, both derived from market data) achieves significance (p &lt; 0.001), confirming the pipeline detects real structure. The null result indicates whitepaper narratives do not meaningfully predict market factor structure, with implications for narrative economics and investor decision-making. Entity-level analysis reveals specialized tokens (XMR, CRV, YFI) show stronger narrative-market correspondence than broad infrastructure tokens.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20336v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Provably Reliable Classifier Guidance via Cross-Entropy Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21200</link><description>arXiv:2601.21200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models generate conditional samples by augmenting the reverse-time score with the gradient of the log-probability predicted by a probabilistic classifier. In practice, this classifier is usually obtained by minimizing an empirical loss function. While existing statistical theory guarantees good generalization performance when the sample size is sufficiently large, it remains unclear whether such training yields an effective guidance mechanism.
  We study this question in the context of cross-entropy loss, which is widely used for classifier training. Under mild smoothness assumptions on the classifier, we show that controlling the cross-entropy at each diffusion model step is sufficient to control the corresponding guidance error. In particular, probabilistic classifiers achieving conditional KL divergence $\varepsilon^2$ induce guidance vectors with mean squared error $\widetilde O(d \varepsilon )$, up to constant and logarithmic factors. Our result yields an upper bound on the sampling error of classifier-guided diffusion models and bears resemblance to a reverse log-Sobolev--type inequality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that quantitatively links classifier training to guidance alignment in diffusion models, providing both a theoretical explanation for the empirical success of classifier guidance, and principled guidelines for selecting classifiers that induce effective guidance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21200v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Statsformer: Validated Ensemble Learning with LLM-Derived Semantic Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21410</link><description>arXiv:2601.21410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Statsformer, a principled framework for integrating large language model (LLM)-derived knowledge into supervised statistical learning. Existing approaches are limited in adaptability and scope: they either inject LLM guidance as an unvalidated heuristic, which is sensitive to LLM hallucination, or embed semantic information within a single fixed learner. Statsformer overcomes both limitations through a guardrailed ensemble architecture. We embed LLM-derived feature priors within an ensemble of linear and nonlinear learners, adaptively calibrating their influence via cross-validation. This design yields a flexible system with an oracle-style guarantee that it performs no worse than any convex combination of its in-library base learners, up to statistical error. Empirically, informative priors yield consistent performance improvements, while uninformative or misspecified LLM guidance is automatically downweighted, mitigating the impact of hallucinations across a diverse range of prediction tasks.An open-source implementation of Statsformer is available at https://github.com/pilancilab/statsformer.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21410v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Impact of LLMs news Sentiment Analysis on Stock Price Movement Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00086</link><description>arXiv:2602.00086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses stock price movement prediction by leveraging LLM-based news sentiment analysis. Earlier works have largely focused on proposing and assessing sentiment analysis models and stock movement prediction methods, however, separately. Although promising results have been achieved, a clear and in-depth understanding of the benefit of the news sentiment to this task, as well as a comprehensive assessment of different architecture types in this context, is still lacking. Herein, we conduct an evaluation study that compares 3 different LLMs, namely, DeBERTa, RoBERTa and FinBERT, for sentiment-driven stock prediction. Our results suggest that DeBERTa outperforms the other two models with an accuracy of 75% and that an ensemble model that combines the three models can increase the accuracy to about 80%. Also, we see that sentiment news features can benefit (slightly) some stock market prediction models, i.e., LSTM-, PatchTST- and tPatchGNN-based classifiers and PatchTST- and TimesNet-based regression tasks models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00086v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Equivalence of Privacy and Stability with Generalization Guarantees in Quantum Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01177</link><description>arXiv:2602.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

A central challenge is to achieve strong utility guarantees for meaningful downstream analysis. Many existing methods ensure uniform accuracy over broad query classes, such as all Lipschitz functions, but this level of generality often leads to suboptimal rates for statistics of practical interest. Since many common data analysis queries exhibit smoothness beyond what worst-case Lipschitz bounds capture, we ask whether exploiting this additional structure can yield improved utility.
  We study the problem of generating $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private synthetic data from a dataset of size $n$ supported on the hypercube $[-1,1]^d$, with utility guarantees uniformly for all smooth queries having bounded derivatives up to order $k$. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a minimax error rate of $n^{-\min \{1, \frac{k}{d}\}}$, up to a $\log(n)$ factor. This characterization uncovers a phase transition at $k=d$. Our results generalize the Chebyshev moment matching framework of (Musco et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2016) and strictly improve the error rates for $k$-smooth queries established in (Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, we establish the first minimax lower bound for the utility of $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private synthetic data with respect to $k$-smooth queries, extending the Wasserstein lower bound for $\varepsilon$-differential privacy in (Boedihardjo et al., 2024).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01607v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EchoJEPA: A Latent Predictive Foundation Model for Echocardiography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02603</link><description>arXiv:2602.02603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for echocardiography often struggle to disentangle anatomical signal from the stochastic speckle and acquisition artifacts inherent to ultrasound. We present EchoJEPA, a foundation model trained on 18 million echocardiograms across 300K patients, representing the largest pretraining corpus for this modality to date. By leveraging a latent predictive objective, EchoJEPA learns robust anatomical representations that ignore speckle noise. We validate this using a novel multi-view probing framework with frozen backbones, where EchoJEPA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by approximately 20% in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) estimation and 17% in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) estimation. The model also exhibits remarkable sample efficiency, reaching 79% view classification accuracy with only 1% of labeled data versus 42% for the best baseline trained on 100%. Crucially, EchoJEPA demonstrates superior generalization, degrading by only 2% under physics-informed acoustic perturbations compared to 17% for competitors. Most remarkably, its zero-shot performance on pediatric patients surpasses fully fine-tuned baselines, establishing latent prediction as a superior paradigm for robust, generalizable medical AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02603v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating the Tesseract Decoder for Quantum Error Correction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02985</link><description>arXiv:2602.02985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for building robust, fault-tolerant quantum computers; however, the decoding process often presents a significant computational bottleneck. Tesseract is a novel Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoder for QEC that employs the A* search algorithm to explore an exponentially large graph of error hypotheses, achieving high decoding speed and accuracy. This paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing the Tesseract decoder through low-level performance enhancements. Based on extensive profiling, we implemented four targeted optimization strategies, including the replacement of inefficient data structures, reorganization of memory layouts to improve cache hit rates, and the use of hardware-accelerated bit-wise operations. We achieved significant decoding speedups across a wide range of code families and configurations, including Color Codes, Bivariate-Bicycle Codes, Surface Codes, and Transversal CNOT Protocols. Our results demonstrate consistent speedups of approximately 2x for most code families, often exceeding 2.5x. Notably, we achieved a peak performance gain of over 5x for the most computationally demanding configurations of Bivariate-Bicycle Codes. These improvements make the Tesseract decoder more efficient and scalable, serving as a practical case study that highlights the importance of high-performance software engineering in QEC and providing a strong foundation for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02985v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Quantum Diffusion Models for Complex Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03405</link><description>arXiv:2602.03405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum generative models offer a novel approach to exploring high-dimensional Hilbert spaces but face significant challenges in scalability and expressibility when applied to multi-modal distributions. In this study, we explore a Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net architecture integrated with Adaptive Non-Local Observables (ANO) as a potential solution to these hurdles. By compressing classical data into a dense quantum latent space and utilizing trainable observables, our model aims to extract non-local features that complement classical processing. We also investigate the role of Skip Connections in preserving semantic information during the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results on the full MNIST dataset (digits 0-9) demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating structurally coherent and recognizable images for all digit classes. While hardware constraints still impose limitations on resolution, our findings suggest that hybrid architectures with adaptive measurements provide a feasible pathway for mitigating mode collapse and enhancing generative capabilities in the NISQ era.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03405v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sounding Highlights: Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Audio-Visual Video Highlight Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03891</link><description>arXiv:2602.03891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual video highlight detection aims to automatically identify the most salient moments in videos by leveraging both visual and auditory cues. However, existing models often underutilize the audio modality, focusing on high-level semantic features while failing to fully leverage the rich, dynamic characteristics of sound. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Video Highlight Detection (DAViHD). The dual-pathway audio encoder is composed of a semantic pathway for content understanding and a dynamic pathway that captures spectro-temporal dynamics. The semantic pathway extracts high-level information by identifying the content within the audio, such as speech, music, or specific sound events. The dynamic pathway employs a frequency-adaptive mechanism as time evolves to jointly model these dynamics, enabling it to identify transient acoustic events via salient spectral bands and rapid energy changes. We integrate the novel audio encoder into a full audio-visual framework and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale MrHiSum benchmark. Our results demonstrate that a sophisticated, dual-faceted audio representation is key to advancing the field of highlight detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03891v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Steering the Herd: A Framework for LLM-based Control of Social Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02648</link><description>arXiv:2504.02648v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms increasingly serve as information mediators--from social media feeds and targeted advertising to the increasing ubiquity of LLMs. This engenders a joint process where agents combine private, algorithmically-mediated signals with learning from peers to arrive at decisions. To study such settings, we introduce a model of controlled sequential social learning in which an information-mediating planner (e.g. an LLM) controls the information structure of agents while they also learn from the decisions of earlier agents. The planner may seek to improve social welfare (altruistic planner) or to induce a specific action the planner prefers (biased planner). Our framework presents a new optimization problem for social learning that combines dynamic programming with decentralized action choices and Bayesian belief updates. We prove the convexity of the value function and characterize the optimal policies of altruistic and biased planners, which attain desired tradeoffs between the costs they incur and the payoffs they earn from induced agent choices. Notably, in some regimes the biased planner intentionally obfuscates the agents' signals. Even under stringent transparency constraints--information parity with individuals, no lying or cherry-picking, and full observability--we show that information mediation can substantially shift social welfare in either direction. We complement our theory with simulations in which LLMs act as both planner and agents. Notably, the LLM planner in our simulations exhibits emergent strategic behavior in steering public opinion that broadly mirrors the trends predicted, though key deviations suggest the influence of non-Bayesian reasoning consistent with the cognitive patterns of both humans and LLMs trained on human-like data. Together, we establish our framework as a tractable basis for studying the impact and regulation of LLM information mediators.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.02648v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HybridQuestion: Human-AI Collaboration for Identifying High-Impact Research Questions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03849</link><description>arXiv:2602.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "AI Scientist" paradigm is transforming scientific research by automating key stages of the research process, from idea generation to scholarly writing. This shift is expected to accelerate discovery and expand the scope of scientific inquiry. However, a key question remains unclear: can AI scientists identify meaningful research questions? While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied successfully to task-specific ideation, their potential to conduct strategic, long-term assessments of past breakthroughs and future questions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore a human-AI hybrid solution that integrates the scalable data processing capabilities of AI with the value judgment of human experts. Our methodology is structured in three phases. The first phase, AI-Accelerated Information Gathering, leverages AI's advantage in processing vast amounts of literature to generate a hybrid information base. The second phase, Candidate Question Proposing, utilizes this synthesized data to prompt an ensemble of six diverse LLMs to propose an initial candidate pool, filtered via a cross-model voting mechanism. The third phase, Hybrid Question Selection, refines this pool through a multi-stage filtering process that progressively increases human oversight. To validate this system, we conducted an experiment aiming to identify the Top 10 Scientific Breakthroughs of 2025 and the Top 10 Scientific Questions for 2026 across five major disciplines. Our analysis reveals that while AI agents demonstrate high alignment with human experts in recognizing established breakthroughs, they exhibit greater divergence in forecasting prospective questions, suggesting that human judgment remains crucial for evaluating subjective, forward-looking challenges.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WebAccessVL: Making an Accessible Web via Violation-Conditioned VLM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03850</link><description>arXiv:2602.03850v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The mastery of Hijaiyah letters is a crucial foundation for reading and comprehending the Quran, yet conventional pedagogical approaches based on repetitive memorization frequently struggle to maintain the engagement of young learners in contemporary educational contexts. This research presents the design and implementation of an innovative gamification-based methodology for Hijaiyah literacy acquisition, systematically developed through the ADDIE framework (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) to optimize student motivation, participation, and educational outcomes. The resulting technological solution, engineered using Unity 2D and Firebase, strategically incorporates game design elements such as points, badges, leaderboards, and progressive leveling, while integrating multifaceted learning components including visual animations, authentic tajwid-based audio pronunciation, and interactive letter tracing exercises to simultaneously develop cognitive recognition capabilities and fine motor skills. Empirical evaluation involving 50 elementary school participants revealed substantial quantitative improvements, with mean assessment scores increasing from 42.8 to 88.6 (107% improvement, p &lt; 0.001), demonstrating an exceptionally large effect size (Cohen's d = 4.87), complemented by strong user engagement metrics (4.2 average daily sessions) and high satisfaction ratings (4.82 out of 5 mean motivation score). Beyond cognitive learning outcomes, the gamified approach effectively fostered intrinsic Islamic values such as perseverance, responsibility, and disciplined practice, thereby establishing an innovative educational paradigm that successfully integrates traditional Islamic pedagogical principles with modern digital learning technologies to create a transformative, engaging, and meaningful framework for Hijaiyah literacy development in contemporary Islamic education.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03851v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Overcoming Barriers to Computational Reproducibility</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03863</link><description>arXiv:2602.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational reproducibility, the possibility for independent researchers to exactly reproduce published empirical results, is fundamental to science. Despite its importance, the proportion of research articles aiming for reproducibility remains low and uneven across disciplines. Barriers include a perceived lack of incentives for researchers and journals, practical challenges in preparing reproducible materials, and the absence of harmonised standards of reproducibility processes and requirements by journals. Existing guidance is often highly technical, reaching mainly those already engaged with reproducible research. In this paper, we first synthesize evidence on the benefits of reproducibility for both authors and journals. Drawing on our extensive experience in reproducibility checking at various journals, we then put forward concise, pragmatic guidelines for creating reproducible analyses across disciplines. We further review current reproducibility policies of selected journals, illustrating the substantial heterogeneity in requirements and procedures. Motivated by the latter, we propose conceptual foundations for a harmonised multi-tier system of reproducibility standards that could support transparent, consistent assessment across journals and research communities. Our goal as journal (reproducibility) editors and contributors to the MaRDI initiative is to encourage broader adoption of reproducibility practices, in particular by lowering practical barriers for authors and journals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03863v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Have Large Language Models Enhanced the Way Civil &amp; Environmental Engineers Write? A Quantitative Analysis of Scholarly Communication over 25 Years</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03864</link><description>arXiv:2602.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly emerged in civil and environmental engineering (CEE) research, education, and practice as a tool for project ideation, execution, and communication. However, it is unknown how prevalent LLM adoption is across CEE scholarship and whether it meaningfully alters research prose. Inspired by a recent analysis of biomedical abstracts, this study adapts a vocabulary-based frequency-shift methodology to estimate the incidence of LLM-written abstracts in the field of CEE scholarship using 149,452 abstracts published by the American Society of Civil Engineers from 2000 through 2025 as the representative corpus. By quantifying departures from recent vocabulary trends, we estimate 15% and 26% of abstracts published in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Prior to the introduction of LLMs in 2022, CEE publications exhibit long-term trends toward increasing numbers of authors, longer abstracts and sentences, greater use of segmenting punctuation, higher required reading levels, and a shift toward active, first-person verb constructions. Beginning around 2023, however, the frequencies of many excess style words (e.g., enhance) dramatically depart from their historic trajectories, and correspondingly, departures in multiple semantic properties are observed. When abstracts classified as likely LLM-written are isolated, these departures are shown to be largely attributable to LLM-generated text. These abstracts exhibit systematic shifts, including increased word choice diversity, more commas, increased complexity, decreased use of passive constructions, and less qualifying language commonly used to convey uncertainty, such that prose is generally more segmented, syntactically complex, and assertive. Together these findings provide the first large-scale, data-driven assessment of LLM use and effect on CEE scholarly writing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03864v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PaperX: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Academic Presentation Generation with Scholar DAG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03866</link><description>arXiv:2602.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transforming scientific papers into multimodal presentation content is essential for research dissemination but remains labor intensive. Existing automated solutions typically treat each format as an isolated downstream task, leading to redundant processing and semantic inconsistency. We introduce PaperX, a unified framework that models academic presentation generation as a structural transformation and rendering process. Central to our approach is the Scholar DAG, an intermediate representation that decouples the paper's logical structure from its final presentation syntax. By applying adaptive graph traversal strategies, PaperX generates diverse, high quality outputs from a single source. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves the state of the art performance in content fidelity and aesthetic quality while significantly improving cost efficiency compared to specialized single task agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03866v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding the Impact of Differentially Private Training on Memorization of Long-Tailed Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03872</link><description>arXiv:2602.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research shows that modern deep learning models achieve high predictive accuracy partly by memorizing individual training samples. Such memorization raises serious privacy concerns, motivating the widespread adoption of differentially private training algorithms such as DP-SGD. However, a growing body of empirical work shows that DP-SGD often leads to suboptimal generalization performance, particularly on long-tailed data that contain a large number of rare or atypical samples. Despite these observations, a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, and existing differential privacy analysis are difficult to extend to the nonconvex and nonsmooth neural networks commonly used in practice. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for analyzing DP-SGD on long-tailed data from a feature learning perspective. We show that the test error of DP-SGD-trained models on the long-tailed subpopulation is significantly larger than the overall test error over the entire dataset. Our analysis further characterizes the training dynamics of DP-SGD, demonstrating how gradient clipping and noise injection jointly adversely affect the model's ability to memorize informative but underrepresented samples. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03872v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decoding Ambiguous Emotions with Test-Time Scaling in Audio-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03873</link><description>arXiv:2602.03873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition from human speech is a critical enabler for socially aware conversational AI. However, while most prior work frames emotion recognition as a categorical classification problem, real-world affective states are often ambiguous, overlapping, and context-dependent, posing significant challenges for both annotation and automatic modeling. Recent large-scale audio language models (ALMs) offer new opportunities for nuanced affective reasoning without explicit emotion supervision, but their capacity to handle ambiguous emotions remains underexplored. At the same time, advances in inference-time techniques such as test-time scaling (TTS) have shown promise for improving generalization and adaptability in hard NLP tasks, but their relevance to affective computing is still largely unknown. In this work, we introduce the first benchmark for ambiguous emotion recognition in speech with ALMs under test-time scaling. Our evaluation systematically compares eight state-of-the-art ALMs and five TTS strategies across three prominent speech emotion datasets. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the interaction between model capacity, TTS, and affective ambiguity, offering new insights into the computational and representational challenges of ambiguous emotion understanding. Our benchmark establishes a foundation for developing more robust, context-aware, and emotionally intelligent speech-based AI systems, and highlights key future directions for bridging the gap between model assumptions and the complexity of real-world human emotion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03873v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reversible Deep Learning for 13C NMR in Chemoinformatics: On Structures and Spectra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03875</link><description>arXiv:2602.03875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a reversible deep learning model for 13C NMR that uses a single conditional invertible neural network for both directions between molecular structures and spectra. The network is built from i-RevNet style bijective blocks, so the forward map and its inverse are available by construction. We train the model to predict a 128-bit binned spectrum code from a graph-based structure encoding, while the remaining latent dimensions capture residual variability. At inference time, we invert the same trained network to generate structure candidates from a spectrum code, which explicitly represents the one-to-many nature of spectrum-to-structure inference. On a filtered subset, the model is numerically invertible on trained examples, achieves spectrum-code prediction above chance, and produces coarse but meaningful structural signals when inverted on validation spectra. These results demonstrate that invertible architectures can unify spectrum prediction and uncertainty-aware candidate generation within one end-to-end model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03875v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GOPO: Policy Optimization using Ranked Rewards</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03876</link><description>arXiv:2602.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) trains a reward model on pairwise preference data and then uses it for policy optimization. However, while reward models are optimized to capture relative preferences, existing policy optimization techniques rely on absolute reward magnitudes during training. In settings where the rewards are non-verifiable such as summarization, instruction following, and chat completion, this misalignment often leads to suboptimal performance. We introduce Group Ordinal Policy Optimization (GOPO), a policy optimization method that uses only the ranking of the rewards and discards their magnitudes. Our rank-based transformation of rewards provides several gains, compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), in settings with non-verifiable rewards: (1) consistently higher training/validation reward trajectories, (2) improved LLM-as-judge evaluations across most intermediate training steps, and (3) reaching a policy of comparable quality in substantially less training steps than GRPO. We demonstrate consistent improvements across a range of tasks and model sizes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03876v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Intellectual Property Protection for 3D Gaussian Splatting Assets: A Survey</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03878</link><description>arXiv:2602.03878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a mainstream representation for real-time 3D scene synthesis, enabling applications in virtual and augmented reality, robotics, and 3D content creation. Its rising commercial value and explicit parametric structure raise emerging intellectual property (IP) protection concerns, prompting a surge of research on 3DGS IP protection.

To address this gap, we present the first systematic survey on 3DGS IP protection and introduce a bottom-up framework that examines (i) underlying Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive and active protection paradigms, and (iii) robustness threats under emerging generative AI era, revealing gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and indicating opportunities for deeper investigation. Finally, we outline six research directions across robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms, offering a roadmap toward reliable and trustworthy IP protection for 3DGS assets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03878v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiGAN: Diffusion-Guided Attention Network for Early Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03881</link><description>arXiv:2602.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge due to the subtle and temporally irregular progression of structural brain changes in the prodromal stages. Existing deep learning approaches require large longitudinal datasets and often fail to model the temporal continuity and modality irregularities inherent in real-world clinical data. To address these limitations, we propose the Diffusion-Guided Attention Network (DiGAN), which integrates latent diffusion modelling with an attention-guided convolutional network. The diffusion model synthesizes realistic longitudinal neuroimaging trajectories from limited training data, enriching temporal context and improving robustness to unevenly spaced visits. The attention-convolutional layer then captures discriminative structural--temporal patterns that distinguish cognitively normal subjects from those with mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline. Experiments on synthetic and ADNI datasets demonstrate that DiGAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, showing its potential for early-stage AD detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03881v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PriorProbe: Recovering Individual-Level Priors for Personalizing Neural Networks in Facial Expression Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03882</link><description>arXiv:2602.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating individual-level cognitive priors offers an important route to personalizing neural networks, yet accurately eliciting such priors remains challenging: existing methods either fail to uniquely identify them or introduce systematic biases. Here, we introduce PriorProbe, a novel elicitation approach grounded in Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People that recovers fine-grained, individual-specific priors. Focusing on a facial expression recognition task, we apply PriorProbe to individual participants and test whether integrating the recovered priors with a state-of-the-art neural network improves its ability to predict an individual's classification on ambiguous stimuli. The PriorProbe-derived priors yield substantial performance gains, outperforming both the neural network alone and alternative sources of priors, while preserving the network's inference on ground-truth labels. Together, these results demonstrate that PriorProbe provides a general and interpretable framework for personalizing deep neural networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03882v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] 4DPC$^2$hat: Towards Dynamic Point Cloud Understanding with Failure-Aware Bootstrapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03890</link><description>arXiv:2602.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point clouds provide a compact and expressive representation of 3D objects, and have recently been integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing methods primarily focus on static objects, while understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains largely unexplored. This limitation is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and the difficulty of modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts. To bridge this gap, we present 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset 4DPC$^2$hat-200K via a meticulous two-stage pipeline consisting of topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning. The dataset contains over 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated question-answer (QA) pairs, supporting inquiries about counting, temporal relationship, action, spatial relationship, and appearance. At the core of the framework, we introduce a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns among a point cloud sequence. Furthermore, we propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies model deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision to continuously strengthen corresponding reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DPC$^2$hat significantly improves action understanding and temporal reasoning compared with existing models, establishing a strong foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03890v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Audit After Segmentation: Reference-Free Mask Quality Assessment for Language-Referred Audio-Visual Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03892</link><description>arXiv:2602.03892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement.

Abstract: Manual labeling of animal images remains a significant bottleneck in ecological research, limiting the scale and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring efforts. This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences. We introduce an open-source benchmarking toolkit and provide recommendations for ecologists to select appropriate methods for sorting their specific taxonomic groups and data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03894v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Bias Mitigation Toward Fairness Without Harm from Vision to LVLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03895</link><description>arXiv:2602.03895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data often inherit and amplify biases against certain social groups, raising urgent concerns about their deployment at scale. While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices. NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous, harm-aware fairness evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03895v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowledge Model Prompting Increases LLM Performance on Planning Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03900</link><description>arXiv:2602.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) can struggle with reasoning ability and planning tasks. Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03900v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NeuroPareto: Calibrated Acquisition for Costly Many-Goal Search in Vast Parameter Spaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03901</link><description>arXiv:2602.03901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of optimal trade-offs in high-dimensional search spaces under stringent computational constraints poses a fundamental challenge for contemporary multi-objective optimization. We develop NeuroPareto, a cohesive architecture that integrates rank-centric filtering, uncertainty disentanglement, and history-conditioned acquisition strategies to navigate complex objective landscapes. A calibrated Bayesian classifier estimates epistemic uncertainty across non-domination tiers, enabling rapid generation of high-quality candidates with minimal evaluation cost. Deep Gaussian Process surrogates further separate predictive uncertainty into reducible and irreducible components, providing refined predictive means and risk-aware signals for downstream selection. A lightweight acquisition network, trained online from historical hypervolume improvements, guides expensive evaluations toward regions balancing convergence and diversity. With hierarchical screening and amortized surrogate updates, the method maintains accuracy while keeping computational overhead low. Experiments on DTLZ and ZDT suites and a subsurface energy extraction task show that NeuroPareto consistently outperforms classifier-enhanced and surrogate-assisted baselines in Pareto proximity and hypervolume.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03901v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GeoIB: Geometry-Aware Information Bottleneck via Statistical-Manifold Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03906</link><description>arXiv:2602.03906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information Bottleneck (IB) is widely used, but in deep learning, it is usually implemented through tractable surrogates, such as variational bounds or neural mutual information (MI) estimators, rather than directly controlling the MI I(X;Z) itself. The looseness and estimator-dependent bias can make IB "compression" only indirectly controlled and optimization fragile.
  We revisit the IB problem through the lens of information geometry and propose a \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}ottleneck (\textbf{GeoIB}) that dispenses with mutual information (MI) estimation. We show that I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y) admit exact projection forms as minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances from the joint distributions to their respective independence manifolds. Guided by this view, GeoIB controls information compression with two complementary terms: (i) a distribution-level Fisher-Rao (FR) discrepancy, which matches KL to second order and is reparameterization-invariant; and (ii) a geometry-level Jacobian-Frobenius (JF) term that provides a local capacity-type upper bound on I(Z;X) by penalizing pullback volume expansion of the encoder. We further derive a natural-gradient optimizer consistent with the FR metric and prove that the standard additive natural-gradient step is first-order equivalent to the geodesic update. We conducted extensive experiments and observed that the GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane than the mainstream IB baselines on popular datasets. GeoIB improves invariance and optimization stability by unifying distributional and geometric regularization under a single bottleneck multiplier. The source code of GeoIB is released at "https://anonymous.4open.science/r/G-IB-0569".</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HY3D-Bench: Generation of 3D Assets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03907</link><description>arXiv:2602.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent advances in neural representations and generative models have revolutionized 3D content creation, the field remains constrained by significant data processing bottlenecks.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle localization is a critical challenge in urban environments where GPS signals are often unreliable. This paper presents a cooperative multi-sensor and multi-modal localization approach to address this issue by fusing data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems. Our approach integrates cooperative data with a point cloud registration-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The system processes point clouds generated from diverse sensor modalities, including vehicle-mounted LiDAR and stereo cameras, as well as sensors deployed at intersections. By leveraging shared data from infrastructure, our method significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness in complex, GPS-noisy urban scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03908v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Role of Target Update Frequencies in Q-Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03911</link><description>arXiv:2602.03911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The target network update frequency (TUF) is a central stabilization mechanism in (deep) Q-learning. However, their selection remains poorly understood and is often treated merely as another tunable hyperparameter rather than as a principled design decision. This work provides a theoretical analysis of target fixing in tabular Q-learning through the lens of approximate dynamic programming. We formulate periodic target updates as a nested optimization scheme in which each outer iteration applies an inexact Bellman optimality operator, approximated by a generic inner loop optimizer. Rigorous theory yields a finite-time convergence analysis for the asynchronous sampling setting, specializing to stochastic gradient descent in the inner loop. Our results deliver an explicit characterization of the bias-variance trade-off induced by the target update period, showing how to optimally set this critical hyperparameter. We prove that constant target update schedules are suboptimal, incurring a logarithmic overhead in sample complexity that is entirely avoidable with adaptive schedules. Our analysis shows that the optimal target update frequency increases geometrically over the course of the learning process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03911v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Echo State Networks for Time Series Forecasting: Hyperparameter Sweep and Benchmarking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03912</link><description>arXiv:2602.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the forecasting performance of Echo State Networks (ESNs) for univariate time series forecasting using a subset of the M4 Forecasting Competition dataset. Focusing on monthly and quarterly time series with at most 20 years of historical data, we evaluate whether a fully automatic, purely feedback-driven ESN can serve as a competitive alternative to widely used statistical forecasting methods. The study adopts a rigorous two-stage evaluation approach: a Parameter dataset is used to conduct an extensive hyperparameter sweep covering leakage rate, spectral radius, reservoir size, and information criteria for regularization, resulting in over four million ESN model fits; a disjoint Forecast dataset is then used for out-of-sample accuracy assessment. Forecast accuracy is measured using MASE and sMAPE and benchmarked against simple benchmarks like drift and seasonal naive and statistical models like ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS. The hyperparameter analysis reveals consistent and interpretable patterns, with monthly series favoring moderately persistent reservoirs and quarterly series favoring more contractive dynamics. Across both frequencies, high leakage rates are preferred, while optimal spectral radii and reservoir sizes vary with temporal resolution. In the out-of-sample evaluation, the ESN performs on par with ARIMA and TBATS for monthly data and achieves the lowest mean MASE for quarterly data, while requiring lower computational cost than the more complex statistical models. Overall, the results demonstrate that ESNs offer a compelling balance between predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, positioning them as a practical option for automated time series forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03912v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment for Zero-Shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03913</link><description>arXiv:2602.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) aims to recognize unseen characters by leveraging radical-based semantic compositions. However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03913v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Phaedra: Learning High-Fidelity Discrete Tokenization for the Physical Science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03915</link><description>arXiv:2602.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokens are discrete representations that allow modern deep learning to scale by transforming high-dimensional data into sequences that can be efficiently learned, generated, and generalized to new tasks. These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets. Additionally, our results show strong out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to three tasks of increasing complexity, namely known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation and weather data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03915v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SpatiaLab: Can Vision-Language Models Perform Spatial Reasoning in the Wild?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03916</link><description>arXiv:2602.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth &amp; Occlusion, Orientation, Size &amp; Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

Abstract: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have become a dominant pretraining paradigm, yet their substantial model size poses significant challenges for resource-constrained deployment and efficient transfer learning. A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance. Our results reveal substantial block-level redundancy in masked self-supervised vision transformers and demonstrate that information-theoretic analysis offers a principled and efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03918v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Users Understand Robot Foundation Model Performance through Task Success Rates and Beyond</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03920</link><description>arXiv:2602.03920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot Foundation Models (RFMs) represent a promising approach to developing general-purpose home robots. Given the broad capabilities of RFMs, users will inevitably ask an RFM-based robot to perform tasks that the RFM was not trained or evaluated on. In these cases, it is crucial that users understand the risks associated with attempting novel tasks due to the relatively high cost of failure. Furthermore, an informed user who understands an RFM's capabilities will know what situations and tasks the robot can handle. In this paper, we study how non-roboticists interpret performance information from RFM evaluations. These evaluations typically report task success rate (TSR) as the primary performance metric. While TSR is intuitive to experts, it is necessary to validate whether novices also use this information as intended. Toward this end, we conducted a study in which users saw real evaluation data, including TSR, failure case descriptions, and videos from multiple published RFM research projects. The results highlight that non-experts not only use TSR in a manner consistent with expert expectations but also highly value other information types, such as failure cases that are not often reported in RFM evaluations. Furthermore, we find that users want access to both real data from previous evaluations of the RFM and estimates from the robot about how well it will do on a novel task.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03920v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Online Vector Quantized Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03922</link><description>arXiv:2602.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard sequence mixing layers used in language models struggle to balance efficiency and performance. Self-attention performs well on long context tasks but has expensive quadratic compute and linear memory costs, while linear attention and SSMs use only linear compute and constant memory but struggle with long context processing. In this paper, we develop a sequence mixing layer that aims to find a better compromise between memory-compute costs and long-context processing, which we call online vector-quantized (OVQ) attention. OVQ-attention requires linear compute costs and constant memory, but, unlike linear attention and SSMs, it uses a sparse memory update that allows it to greatly increase the size of its memory state and, consequently, memory capacity. We develop a theoretical basis for OVQ-attention based on Gaussian mixture regression, and we test it on a variety of synthetic long context tasks and on long context language modeling. OVQ-attention shows significant improvements over linear attention baselines and the original VQ-attention, on which OVQ-attention was inspired. It demonstrates competitive, and sometimes identical, performance to strong self-attention baselines up 64k sequence length, despite using a small fraction of the memory of full self-attention.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03922v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WIND: Weather Inverse Diffusion for Zero-Shot Atmospheric Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03924</link><description>arXiv:2602.03924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized weather and climate modeling, yet the current landscape remains fragmented: highly specialized models are typically trained individually for distinct tasks. To unify this landscape, we introduce WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model capable of replacing specialized baselines across a vast array of tasks. Crucially, in contrast to previous atmospheric foundation models, we achieve this without any task-specific fine-tuning. To learn a robust, task-agnostic prior of the atmosphere, we pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective, utilizing an unconditional video diffusion model to iteratively reconstruct atmospheric dynamics from a noisy state. At inference, we frame diverse domain-specific problems strictly as inverse problems and solve them via posterior sampling. This unified approach allows us to tackle highly relevant weather and climate problems, including probabilistic forecasting, spatial and temporal downscaling, sparse reconstruction and enforcing conservation laws purely with our pre-trained model. We further demonstrate the model's capacity to generate physically consistent counterfactual storylines of extreme weather events under global warming scenarios. By combining generative video modeling with inverse problem solving, WIND offers a computationally efficient paradigm shift in AI-based atmospheric modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03924v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Autonomous AI Agents for Real-Time Affordable Housing Site Selection: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Under Regulatory Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03940</link><description>arXiv:2602.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affordable housing shortages affect billions, while land scarcity and regulations make site selection slow. We present AURA (Autonomous Urban Resource Allocator), a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning system for real-time affordable housing site selection under hard regulatory constraints (QCT, DDA, LIHTC). We model the task as a constrained multi-objective Markov decision process optimizing accessibility, environmental impact, construction cost, and social equity while enforcing feasibility. AURA uses a regulatory-aware state encoding 127 federal and local constraints, Pareto-constrained policy gradients with feasibility guarantees, and reward decomposition separating immediate costs from long-term social outcomes. On datasets from 8 U.S. metros (47,392 candidate parcels), AURA attains 94.3% regulatory compliance and improves Pareto hypervolume by 37.2% over strong baselines. In a New York City 2026 case study, it reduces selection time from 18 months to 72 hours and identifies 23% more viable sites; chosen sites have 31% better transit access and 19% lower environmental impact than expert picks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Linguistic Blind Spots in Clinical Decision Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03942</link><description>arXiv:2602.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting medical decisions from clinical notes is a key step for clinical decision support and patient-facing care summaries. We study how the linguistic characteristics of clinical decisions vary across decision categories and whether these differences explain extraction failures. Using MedDec discharge summaries annotated with decision categories from the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM), we compute seven linguistic indices for each decision span and analyze span-level extraction recall of a standard transformer model. We find clear category-specific signatures: drug-related and problem-defining decisions are entity-dense and telegraphic, whereas advice and precaution decisions contain more narrative, with higher stopword and pronoun proportions and more frequent hedging and negation cues. On the validation split, exact-match recall is 48%, with large gaps across linguistic strata: recall drops from 58% to 24% from the lowest to highest stopword-proportion bins, and spans containing hedging or negation cues are less likely to be recovered. Under a relaxed overlap-based match criterion, recall increases to 71%, indicating that many errors are span boundary disagreements rather than complete misses. Overall, narrative-style spans--common in advice and precaution decisions--are a consistent blind spot under exact matching, suggesting that downstream systems should incorporate boundary-tolerant evaluation and extraction strategies for clinical decisions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03942v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Depressive Symptoms through Emotion Pairs within Asian American Families</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03943</link><description>arXiv:2602.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies on intergenerational relationships between parents and children in Asian American families highlight their impact on mental health and well-being. This study investigates the role of ambivalent emotions in online narratives shared by Asian and Asian American children on the subreddit, r/Asianparentstories. By employing a BERT-based model to detect emotion at the sentence level and depressive symptoms at the post level, we analyze mixed feelings to better understand how they predict depressive symptoms. First, among 28 detectable, eight (realization, approval, sadness, anger, curiosity, annoyance, disappointment, disapproval) comprise over 50%, exhibiting significant co-occurrence among themselves and with other emotions. Second, we find the co-occurrence of multiple emotions, indicating that emotions in a single post are not limited to consistently positive or negative feelings. Finally, our findings indicate that while negative emotion pairs (e.g., confusion-grief, anger-grief) are associated with depressive symptoms, positive emotion pairs (e.g., admiration-realization, amusement-joy) negatively correlate with depressive symptoms, and combinations of ambivalent emotions indicate varied results in predicting depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of automated emotion classification and the need to consider emotional ambivalence, which holds practical and clinical implications for understanding the dynamics of parent-child relationships.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Grables: Tabular Learning Beyond Independent Rows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03945</link><description>arXiv:2602.03945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular learning is still dominated by row-wise predictors that score each row independently, which fits i.i.d. benchmarks but fails on transactional, temporal, and relational tables where labels depend on other rows. We show that row-wise prediction rules out natural targets driven by global counts, overlaps, and relational patterns. To make "using structure" precise across architectures, we introduce grables: a modular interface that separates how a table is lifted to a graph (constructor) from how predictions are computed on that graph (node predictor), pinpointing where expressive power comes from. Experiments on synthetic tasks, transaction data, and a RelBench clinical-trials dataset confirm the predicted separations: message passing captures inter-row dependencies that row-local models miss, and hybrid approaches that explicitly extract inter-row structure and feed it to strong tabular learners yield consistent gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03945v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semantic Rate Distortion and Posterior Design: Compute Constraints, Multimodality, and Strategic Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03949</link><description>arXiv:2602.03949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strategic Gaussian semantic compression under rate and compute constraints, where an encoder and decoder optimize distinct quadratic objectives. A latent Gaussian state generates a task dependent semantic variable, and the decoder best responds via MMSE estimation, reducing the encoder's problem to posterior covariance design under an information rate constraint. We characterize the strategic rate distortion function in direct, remote, and full information regimes, derive semantic waterfilling and rate constrained Gaussian persuasion solutions, and establish Gaussian optimality under misaligned objectives. We further show that architectural compute limits act as implicit rate constraints, yielding exponential improvements in semantic accuracy with model depth and inference time compute, while multimodal observation eliminates the geometric mean penalty inherent to remote encoding. These results provide information theoretic foundations for data and energy efficient AI and offer a principled interpretation of modern multimodal language models as posterior design mechanisms under resource constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03949v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Mathematical Problem Solving in LLMs through Execution-Driven Reasoning Augmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03950</link><description>arXiv:2602.03950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical problem solving is a fundamental benchmark for assessing the reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence and a gateway to applications in education, science, and engineering where reliable symbolic reasoning is essential. Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus. IIPC surpasses competing approaches in the majority of reasoning benchmarks on multiple base LLMs. All code and implementations are released as open source.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03950v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
