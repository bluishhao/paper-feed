Abstract: GutenOCR is a family of grounded OCR front-ends obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. The resulting single-checkpoint vision-language models expose reading, detection, and grounding through a unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14490v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structured Image-based Coding for Efficient Gaussian Splatting Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14510</link><description>arXiv:2601.14510v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art representation for radiance fields, combining real-time rendering with high visual fidelity. However, GS models require storing millions of parameters, leading to large file sizes that impair their use in practical multimedia systems. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GS Image-based Compression (GSICO), a novel GS codec that efficiently compresses pre-trained GS models while preserving perceptual fidelity. The core contribution lies in a mapping procedure that arranges GS parameters into structured images, guided by a novel algorithm that enhances spatial coherence. These GS parameter images are then encoded using a conventional image codec. Experimental evaluations on Tanks and Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets show that GSICO achieves average compression factors of 20.2x with minimal loss in visual quality, as measured by PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Compared with state-of-the-art GS compression methods, the proposed codec consistently yields superior rate-distortion (RD) trade-offs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14510v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Report for NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14541</link><description>arXiv:2601.14541v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report distills the discussions and recommendations from the NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation (EDA), held on December 10, 2024 in Vancouver alongside NeurIPS 2024. Bringing together experts across machine learning and EDA, the workshop examined how AI-spanning large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), neurosymbolic methods, etc.-can facilitate EDA and shorten design turnaround. The workshop includes four themes: (1) AI for physical synthesis and design for manufacturing (DFM), discussing challenges in physical manufacturing process and potential AI applications; (2) AI for high-level and logic-level synthesis (HLS/LLS), covering pragma insertion, program transformation, RTL code generation, etc.; (3) AI toolbox for optimization and design, discussing frontier AI developments that could potentially be applied to EDA tasks; and (4) AI for test and verification, including LLM-assisted verification tools, ML-augmented SAT solving, security/reliability challenges, etc. The report recommends NSF to foster AI/EDA collaboration, invest in foundational AI for EDA, develop robust data infrastructures, promote scalable compute infrastructure, and invest in workforce development to democratize hardware design and enable next-generation hardware systems.

Abstract: Scribble-supervised methods have emerged to mitigate the prohibitive annotation burden in medical image segmentation. However, the inherent sparsity of these annotations introduces significant ambiguity, which results in noisy pseudo-label propagation and hinders the learning of robust anatomical boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose SDT-Net, a novel dual-teacher, single-student framework designed to maximize supervision quality from these weak signals. Our method features a Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select the most reliable teacher. This selected teacher then guides the student via two synergistic mechanisms: high-confidence pseudo-labels, refined by a Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism, and multi-level feature alignment, enforced by a Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module. Extensive experiments on the ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets demonstrate that SDT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14563v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automatically Tightening Access Control Policies with Restricter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14582</link><description>arXiv:2601.14582v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust access control is a cornerstone of secure software, systems, and networks. An access control mechanism is as effective as the policy it enforces. However, authoring effective policies that satisfy desired properties such as the principle of least privilege is a challenging task even for experienced administrators, as evidenced by many real instances of policy misconfiguration. In this paper, we set out to address this pain point by proposing Restricter, which automatically tightens each (permit) policy rule of a policy with respect to an access log, which captures some already exercised access requests and their corresponding access decisions (i.e., allow or deny). Restricter achieves policy tightening by reducing the number of access requests permitted by a policy rule without sacrificing the functionality of the underlying system it is regulating. We implement Restricter for Amazon's Cedar policy language and demonstrate its effectiveness through two realistic case studies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14582v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Ion-Intercalation Memristor for Enabling Full Parallel Writing in Crossbar Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14613</link><description>arXiv:2601.14613v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossbar architectures have long been seen as a promising foundation for in-memory computing, using memristor arrays for high-density, energy-efficient analog computation. However, this conventional architecture suffers from a fundamental limitation: the inability to perform parallel write operations due to the sneak path problem. This arises from the structural overlap of read and write paths, forcing sequential or semi-parallel updates and severely limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a new memristor design that decouples read and write operations at the device level. This design enables orthogonal conductive paths, and employs a reversible ion doping mechanism, inspired by lithium-ion battery principles, to modulate resistance states independently of computation. Fabricated devices exhibit near-ideal memristive characteristics and stable performance under isolated read/write conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14613v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gaming the Judge: Unfaithful Chain-of-Thought Can Undermine Agent Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14691</link><description>arXiv:2601.14691v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to evaluate agent performance, particularly in non-verifiable settings where judgments rely on agent trajectories including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14691v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Render-of-Thought: Rendering Textual Chain-of-Thought as Images for Visual Latent Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14750</link><description>arXiv:2601.14750v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in unlocking the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT. Furthermore, it maintains competitive performance against other methods, validating the feasibility of this paradigm.

Abstract: Post-training pretrained Autoregressive models (ARMs) into Masked Diffusion models (MDMs) has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to overcome the limitations of sequential generation. However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic "mechanism shift" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14758v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Task Transformer for Explainable Speech Deepfake Detection via Formant Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14850</link><description>arXiv:2601.14850v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a multi-task transformer for speech deepfake detection, capable of predicting formant trajectories and voicing patterns over time, ultimately classifying speech as real or fake, and highlighting whether its decisions rely more on voiced or unvoiced regions. Building on a prior speaker-formant transformer architecture, we streamline the model with an improved input segmentation strategy, redesign the decoding process, and integrate built-in explainability. Compared to the baseline, our model requires fewer parameters, trains faster, and provides better interpretability, without sacrificing prediction performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14850v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Exponential Integration for Stable Gaussian Mixture Black-Box Variational Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14855</link><description>arXiv:2601.14855v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box variational inference (BBVI) with Gaussian mixture families offers a flexible approach for approximating complex posterior distributions without requiring gradients of the target density. However, standard numerical optimization methods often suffer from instability and inefficiency. We develop a stable and efficient framework that combines three key components: (1) affine-invariant preconditioning via natural gradient formulations, (2) an exponential integrator that unconditionally preserves the positive definiteness of covariance matrices, and (3) adaptive time stepping to ensure stability and to accommodate distinct warm-up and convergence phases. The proposed approach has natural connections to manifold optimization and mirror descent. For Gaussian posteriors, we prove exponential convergence in the noise-free setting and almost-sure convergence under Monte Carlo estimation, rigorously justifying the necessity of adaptive time stepping. Numerical experiments on multimodal distributions, Neal's multiscale funnel, and a PDE-based Bayesian inverse problem for Darcy flow demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14855v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The GDN-CC Dataset: Automatic Corpus Clarification for AI-enhanced Democratic Citizen Consultations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14944</link><description>arXiv:2601.14944v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are ubiquitous in modern NLP, and while their applicability extends to texts produced for democratic activities such as online deliberations or large-scale citizen consultations, ethical questions have been raised for their usage as analysis tools. We continue this line of research with two main goals: (a) to develop resources that can help standardize citizen contributions in public forums at the pragmatic level, and make them easier to use in topic modeling and political analysis; (b) to study how well this standardization can reliably be performed by small, open-weights LLMs, i.e. models that can be run locally and transparently with limited resources. Accordingly, we introduce Corpus Clarification as a preprocessing framework for large-scale consultation data that transforms noisy, multi-topic contributions into structured, self-contained argumentative units ready for downstream analysis. We present GDN-CC, a manually-curated dataset of 1,231 contributions to the French Grand D\'ebat National, comprising 2,285 argumentative units annotated for argumentative structure and manually clarified. We then show that finetuned Small Language Models match or outperform LLMs on reproducing these annotations, and measure their usability for an opinion clustering task. We finally release GDN-CC-large, an automatically annotated corpus of 240k contributions, the largest annotated democratic consultation dataset to date.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14944v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LogicScore: Fine-grained Logic Evaluation of Conciseness, Completeness, and Determinateness in Attributed Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15050</link><description>arXiv:2601.15050v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluation methods for Attributed Question Answering (AQA) suffer from \textit{attribution myopia}: they emphasize verification of isolated statements and their attributions but overlook the global logical integrity of long-form answers. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce factually grounded yet logically incoherent responses with elusive deductive gaps. To mitigate this limitation, we present \textsc{LogicScore}, a unified evaluation framework that shifts the paradigm from local assessment to global reasoning scrutiny. Grounded in Horn Rules, our approach integrates a backward verification mechanism to systematically evaluate three key reasoning dimensions: \textit{Completeness} (logically sound deduction), \textit{Conciseness} (non-redundancy), and \textit{Determinateness} (consistent answer entailment). Extensive experiments across three multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, MusiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) and over 20 LLMs (including GPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, LLaMA3, and task-specific tuned models) reveal a critical capability gap: leading models often achieve high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85\% precision for Gemini-3 Pro) but struggle with global reasoning quality (e.g., 35.11\% Conciseness for Gemini-3 Pro). Our work establishes a robust standard for logical evaluation, highlighting the need to prioritize reasoning coherence alongside factual grounding in LLM development.

Abstract: Whisper has become the de-facto encoder for extracting general-purpose audio features in large audio-language models, where a 30-second clip is typically represented by 1500 frame features projected into an LLM. In contrast, audio-text embedding models like CLAP-based models have largely relied on alternative audio encoders (e.g., HTS-AT, PaSST), and have not leveraged Whisper effectively. We present WavLink, a compact audio-text embedding model that augments Whisper encoder with a learnable global token, trained jointly with a text encoder. Through a systematic study of design choices, including pretrained text encoders, loss functions, training modes, and data mixtures, we identify configurations that yield state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Our two-stage training recipe across three model sizes, combined with Matryoshka-style supervision, improves scalability, enabling 8x smaller embeddings with minimal performance drop. WavLink also demonstrates competitive performance on AIR-Bench with MCQs and zero-shot classification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15118v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emerging from Ground: Addressing Intent Deviation in Tool-Using Agents via Deriving Real Calls into Virtual Trajectories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15120</link><description>arXiv:2601.15120v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15120v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BayesianVLA: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15197</link><description>arXiv:2601.15197v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\pi(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15197v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deaf and Hard of Hearing Access to Intelligent Personal Assistants: Comparison of Voice-Based Options with an LLM-Powered Touch Interface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15209</link><description>arXiv:2601.15209v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people who can use their voice in everyday communication. The inability of IPAs to understand diverse accents including deaf speech renders them largely inaccessible to non-signing and speaking DHH individuals. Using an Echo Show, we compare the usability of natural language input via spoken English; with Alexa's automatic speech recognition and a Wizard-of-Oz setting with a trained facilitator re-speaking commands against that of a large language model (LLM)-assisted touch interface in a mixed-methods study. The touch method was navigated through an LLM-powered "task prompter," which integrated the user's history and smart environment to suggest contextually-appropriate commands. Quantitative results showed no significant differences across both spoken English conditions vs LLM-assisted touch. Qualitative results showed variability in opinions on the usability of each method. Ultimately, it will be necessary to have robust deaf-accented speech recognized natively by IPAs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15209v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Finite-Sample Inference for Sparsely Permuted Linear Regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14872</link><description>arXiv:2601.14872v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a linear observation model with an unknown permutation called \textit{permuted/shuffled linear regression}, where responses and covariates are mismatched and the permutation forms a discrete, factorial-size parameter. The permutation is a key component of the data-generating process, yet its statistical investigation remains challenging due to its discrete nature. We develop a general statistical inference framework on the permutation and regression coefficients. First, we introduce a localization step that reduces the permutation space to a small candidate set building on recent advances in the repro samples method, whose miscoverage decays polynomially with the number of Monte Carlo samples. Then, based on this localized set, we provide statistical inference procedures: a conditional Monte Carlo test of permutation structures with valid finite-sample Type-I error control. We also develop coefficient inference that remains valid under alignment uncertainty of permutations. For computational purposes, we develop a linear assignment problem computable in polynomial time and demonstrate that, with high probability, the solution is equivalent to that of the conventional least squares with large computational cost. Extensions to partially permuted designs and ridge regularization are further discussed. Extensive simulations and an application to air-quality data corroborate finite-sample validity, strong power to detect mismatches, and practical scalability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14872v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Competitive Audio-Language Models with Data-Efficient Single-Stage Training on Public Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07526</link><description>arXiv:2509.07526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with audio remains underexplored despite audio's centrality to human communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably small amount of public audio data, less than 30K hours (5K unique), Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency, single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through extensive ablations, we find that common complexities such as curriculum learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on over 500K hours of data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.07526v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Online Operator Design in Evolutionary Optimization for Flexible Job Shop Scheduling via Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16485</link><description>arXiv:2511.16485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Customized static operator design has enabled widespread application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but their search effectiveness often deteriorates as evolutionary progresses. Dynamic operator configuration approaches attempt to alleviate this issue, but they typically rely on predefined operator structures and localized parameter control, lacking sustained adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for online operator design in Evolutionary Optimization, named LLM4EO, comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, operators are initialized by leveraging LLMs to distill and transfer knowledge from well-established operators. Then, search behaviors and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance with evolutionary features, accompanied by suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, an LLM-driven meta-operator dynamically optimizes gene selection of operators by prompt-guided improvement strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of solutions and operators within a unified optimization framework, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks of flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms tailored EAs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.16485v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Monadic Context Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22431</link><description>arXiv:2512.22431v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22431v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GDEPO: Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right Advantage Policy Optimization with Enhanced Training Data Utilization for Sample-Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06795</link><description>arXiv:2601.06795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) represents a fundamental challenge in Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the construction of machine-verifiable proofs in formal languages such as Lean to evaluate AI reasoning capabilities. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the high-performance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, has emerged as a mainstream approach for this task. However, in ATP scenarios, GRPO faces two critical issues: when composite rewards are used, its relative advantage estimation may conflict with the binary feedback from the formal verifier; meanwhile, its static sampling strategy may discard entire batches of data if no valid proof is found, resulting in zero contribution to model updates and significant data waste. To address these limitations, we propose Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right-advantage Policy Optimization (GDEPO), a method incorporating three core mechanisms: 1) dynamic additional sampling, which resamples invalid batches until a valid proof is discovered; 2) equal-right advantage, decoupling the sign of the advantage function (based on correctness) from its magnitude (modulated by auxiliary rewards) to ensure stable and correct policy updates; and 3) dynamic additional iterations, applying extra gradient steps to initially failed but eventually successful samples to accelerate learning on challenging cases. Experiments conducted on three datasets of varying difficulty (MinF2F-test, MathOlympiadBench, PutnamBench) confirm the effectiveness of GDEPO, while ablation studies validate the necessity of its synergistic components. The proposed method enhances data utilization and optimization efficiency, offering a novel training paradigm for ATP.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06795v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMs Got Rhythm? Hybrid Phonological Filtering for Greek Poetry Rhyme Detection and Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09631</link><description>arXiv:2601.09631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities across NLP tasks, struggle with phonologically-grounded phenomena like rhyme detection and generation. This is even more evident in lower-resource languages such as Modern Greek. In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms to achieve accurate rhyme identification/analysis and generation. Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant "Reasoning Gap": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought. Most critically, pure LLM generation fails catastrophically (under 4\% valid poems), while our hybrid verification loop restores performance to 73.1\%. We release our system and a corpus of 40,000+ rhymes, derived from the Anemoskala and Interwar Poetry corpora, to support future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09631v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SUG-Occ: An Explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Framework for Real-Time 3D Occupancy Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11396</link><description>arXiv:2601.11396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11396v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Numerical Optimization Strategies for the Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz in Noisy Quantum Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22398</link><description>arXiv:2505.22398v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of variational methods in near-term quantum computing makes optimizer choice critical, yet selection is frequently intuition-based. We therefore present a systematic benchmark of eight classical optimization algorithms for variational quantum chemistry using the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz. Performance is evaluated on H$_2$, H$_4$, and LiH in both full and active-space representations under noiseless and finite-shot sampling noise. Sampling noise substantially reshapes cost landscapes, induces wandering near minima, and flips optimizer rankings: gradient-based methods perform best in noiseless simulations, whereas population-based optimizers, particularly CMA-ES, show greater robustness under finite-shot noise. Optimizer performance is strongly problem dependent: Hartree-Fock initialization aids small systems, but its advantage diminishes with system size. Also, we observe that finite shot sampling frequently violates the lower bound given by the variational principle, a principle that cannot be strictly held in the presence of noise. By exploiting the guaranteed convergence of Evolution Strategies to a steady state distribution defined by the noise floor, we utilize the symmetry of these violations to achieve energy estimation precision beyond the intrinsic sampling limit.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.22398v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Principled Coarse-Grained Acceptance for Speculative Decoding in Speech</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13732</link><description>arXiv:2511.13732v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive speech generation by letting a fast draft model propose tokens that a larger target model verifies. However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity. These results suggest acoustically aware, group-level acceptance as a simple and general way to accelerate speech token generation while maintaining speech quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.13732v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SOSControl: Enhancing Human Motion Generation through Saliency-Aware Symbolic Orientation and Timing Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14258</link><description>arXiv:2601.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional text-to-motion frameworks often lack precise control, and existing approaches based on joint keyframe locations provide only positional guidance, making it challenging and unintuitive to specify body part orientations and motion timing. To address these limitations, we introduce the Salient Orientation Symbolic (SOS) script, a programmable symbolic framework for specifying body part orientations and motion timing at keyframes. We further propose an automatic SOS extraction pipeline that employs temporally-constrained agglomerative clustering for frame saliency detection and a Saliency-based Masking Scheme (SMS) to generate sparse, interpretable SOS scripts directly from motion data. Moreover, we present the SOSControl framework, which treats the available orientation symbols in the sparse SOS script as salient and prioritizes satisfying these constraints during motion generation. By incorporating SMS-based data augmentation and gradient-based iterative optimization, the framework enhances alignment with user-specified constraints. Additionally, it employs a ControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE Decoder to ensure smooth and natural motion outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SOS extraction pipeline generates human-interpretable scripts with symbolic annotations at salient keyframes, while the SOSControl framework outperforms existing baselines in motion quality, controllability, and generalizability with respect to motion timing and body part orientation control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14258v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer for Emotion Recognition and Adaptive Human-Computer Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14259</link><description>arXiv:2601.14259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition is a fundamental component of next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling machines to perceive, understand, and respond to users' affective states. However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14259v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] End-to-End Transformer Acceleration Through Processing-in-Memory Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14260</link><description>arXiv:2601.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have become central to natural language processing and large language models, but their deployment at scale faces three major challenges. First, the attention mechanism requires massive matrix multiplications and frequent movement of intermediate results between memory and compute units, leading to high latency and energy costs. Second, in long-context inference, the key-value cache (KV cache) can grow unpredictably and even surpass the model's weight size, creating severe memory and bandwidth bottlenecks. Third, the quadratic complexity of attention with respect to sequence length amplifies both data movement and compute overhead, making large-scale inference inefficient. To address these issues, this work introduces processing-in-memory solutions that restructure attention and feed-forward computation to minimize off-chip data transfers, dynamically compress and prune the KV cache to manage memory growth, and reinterpret attention as an associative memory operation to reduce complexity and hardware footprint. Moreover, we evaluate our processing-in-memory design against state-of-the-art accelerators and general-purpose GPUs, demonstrating significant improvements in energy efficiency and latency. Together, these approaches address computation overhead, memory scalability, and attention complexity, further enabling efficient, end-to-end acceleration of Transformer models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14260v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Intelligent Power Grid Design Review via Active Perception-Enabled Multimodal Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14261</link><description>arXiv:2601.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intelligent review of power grid engineering design drawings is crucial for power system safety. However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference. This research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14261v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Call2Instruct: Automated Pipeline for Generating Q&amp;A Datasets from Call Center Recordings for LLM Fine-Tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14263</link><description>arXiv:2601.14263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adaptation of Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) to specific domains depends on high-quality fine-tuning datasets, particularly in instructional format (e.g., Question-Answer - Q&amp;amp;A). However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&amp;amp;A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&amp;amp;A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&amp;amp;A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14263v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Psychometric Comparability of LLM-Based Digital Twins</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14264</link><description>arXiv:2601.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used as "digital twins" to replace human respondents, yet their psychometric comparability to humans is uncertain. We propose a construct-validity framework spanning construct representation and the nomological net, benchmarking digital twins against human gold standards across models, tasks and testing how person-specific inputs shape performance. Across studies, digital twins achieved high population-level accuracy and strong within-participant profile correlations, alongside attenuated item-level correlations. In word association tests, LLM-based networks show small-world structure and theory-consistent communities similar to humans, yet diverge lexically and in local structure. In decision-making and contextualized tasks, digital twins under-reproduce heuristic biases, showing normative rationality, compressed variance and limited sensitivity to temporal information. Feature-rich digital twins improve Big Five Personality prediction, but their personality networks show only configural invariance and do not achieve metric invariance. In more applied free-text tasks, feature-rich digital twins better match human narratives, but linguistic differences persist. Together, these results indicate that feature-rich conditioning enhances validity but does not resolve systematic divergences in psychometric comparability. Future work should therefore prioritize delineating the effective boundaries of digital twins, establishing the precise contexts in which they function as reliable proxies for human cognition and behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14264v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Textbook to Talkbot: A Case Study of a Greek-Language RAG-Based Chatbot in Higher Education</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14265</link><description>arXiv:2601.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of AI chatbots into educational settings has opened new pathways for transforming teaching and learning, offering enhanced support to both educators and learners. This study investigates the design and application of an AI chatbot as an educational tool in higher education. Designed to operate in the Greek language, the chatbot addresses linguistic challenges unique to Greek while delivering accurate, context grounded support aligned with the curriculum. The AI chatbot is built on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework by grounding its responses in specific course content. RAG architecture significantly enhances the chatbots reliability by providing accurate, context-aware responses while mitigating common challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and misinformation. The AI chatbot serves a dual purpose: it enables students to access accurate, ondemand academic support and assists educators in the rapid creation of relevant educational materials. This dual functionality promotes learner autonomy and streamlines the instructional design process. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, reliability, and perceived usability of RAG based chatbots in higher education, exploring their potential to enhance educational practices and outcomes as well as supporting the broader adoption of AI technologies in language specific educational contexts. Findings from this research are expected to contribute to the emerging field of AI driven education by demonstrating how intelligent systems can be effectively aligned with pedagogical goals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14265v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GCG Attack On A Diffusion LLM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14266</link><description>arXiv:2601.14266v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Biomedical evidence synthesis relies on accurate extraction of methodological, laboratory, and outcome variables from full-text research articles, yet these variables are embedded in complex scientific PDFs that make manual abstraction time-consuming and difficult to scale. Existing document AI systems remain limited by OCR errors, long-document fragmentation, constrained throughput, and insufficient auditability for high-stakes synthesis. We present a schema-constrained AI extraction system that transforms full-text biomedical PDFs into structured, analysis-ready records by explicitly restricting model inference through typed schemas, controlled vocabularies, and evidence-gated decisions. Documents are ingested using resume-aware hashing, partitioned into caption-aware page-level chunks, and processed asynchronously under explicit concurrency controls. Chunk-level outputs are deterministically merged into study-level records using conflict-aware consolidation, set-based aggregation, and sentence-level provenance to support traceability and post-hoc audit. Evaluated on a corpus of studies on direct oral anticoagulant level measurement, the pipeline processed all documents without manual intervention, maintained stable throughput under service constraints, and exhibited strong internal consistency across document chunks. Iterative schema refinement substantially improved extraction fidelity for synthesis-critical variables, including assay classification, outcome definitions, follow-up duration, and timing of measurement. These results demonstrate that schema-constrained, provenance-aware extraction enables scalable and auditable transformation of heterogeneous scientific PDFs into structured evidence, aligning modern document AI with the transparency and reliability requirements of biomedical evidence synthesis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14267v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Developmental trajectories of decision making and affective dynamics in large language models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14268</link><description>arXiv:2601.14268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in medicine and clinical workflows, yet we know little about their decision and affective profiles. Taking a historically informed outlook on the future, we treated successive OpenAI models as an evolving lineage and compared them with humans in a gambling task with repeated happiness ratings. Computational analyses showed that some aspects became more human-like: newer models took more risks and displayed more human-like patterns of Pavlovian approach and avoidance. At the same time, distinctly non-human signatures emerged: loss aversion dropped below neutral levels, choices became more deterministic than in humans, affective decay increased across versions and exceeded human levels, and baseline mood remained chronically higher than in humans. These "developmental" trajectories reveal an emerging psychology of machines and have direct implications for AI ethics and for thinking about how LLMs might be integrated into clinical decision support and other high-stakes domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14268v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Slow Drift of Support: Boundary Failures in Multi-Turn Mental Health LLM Dialogues</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14269</link><description>arXiv:2601.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for mental health support. However, current safety evaluations in this field are mostly limited to detecting whether LLMs output prohibited words in single-turn conversations, neglecting the gradual erosion of safety boundaries in long dialogues. Examples include making definitive guarantees, assuming responsibility, and playing professional roles. We believe that with the evolution of mainstream LLMs, words with obvious safety risks are easily filtered by their underlying systems, while the real danger lies in the gradual transgression of boundaries during multi-turn interactions, driven by the LLM's attempts at comfort and empathy.
  This paper proposes a multi-turn stress testing framework and conducts long-dialogue safety tests on three cutting-edge LLMs using two pressure methods: static progression and adaptive probing. We generated 50 virtual patient profiles and stress-tested each model through up to 20 rounds of virtual psychiatric dialogues. The experimental results show that violations are common, and both pressure modes produced similar violation rates. However, adaptive probing significantly advanced the time at which models crossed boundaries, reducing the average number of turns from 9.21 in static progression to 4.64. Under both mechanisms, making definitive or zero-risk promises was the primary way in which boundaries were breached. These findings suggest that the robustness of LLM safety boundaries cannot be inferred solely through single-turn tests; it is necessary to fully consider the wear and tear on safety boundaries caused by different interaction pressures and characteristics in extended dialogues.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14269v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Opening the Black Box: A Survey on the Mechanisms of Multi-Step Reasoning in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14270</link><description>arXiv:2601.14270v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) requires representations that effectively integrate signals from multiple modalities. These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \emph{unique}, \emph{redundant}, and \emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \emph{\textbf{D}ivide and \textbf{R}efine} (\textbf{DnR}). In the \textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition.

Abstract: Effective cooperation is pivotal in distributed learning for multi-agent systems, where the interplay between the quantity and quality of the machine learning models is crucial. This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology, showcasing its superiority over the state-of-the-art distributed GP methods with different benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14275v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Which Quantization Should I Use?

Abstract: Quantization is a practical technique for making large language models easier to deploy by reducing the precision used to store and operate on model weights. This can lower memory use and improve runtime feasibility on constrained hardware, which is especially relevant for users running models locally. Quantization in llama.cpp enables large language models to run on commodity hardware, but available formats are often evaluated inconsistently, making it hard to choose among schemes. We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time. Ultimately, this work is a practical guide for choosing a llama.cpp quantization scheme, helping readers make informed, context-aware decisions for their intended use and resource budget.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14277v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Limits of Learned Importance Scoring for KV Cache Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14279</link><description>arXiv:2601.14279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate learned KV cache compression through Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP), a 1.7M parameter non-query-aware scorer that predicts token importance from KV representations alone. Despite architectural sophistication (multi-horizon lookahead, cross-attention), SIP does not outperform simple baselines, including random selection, across 5 seeds, 4 retention levels, and 3 tasks. Key findings: (1) position-based heuristics (keep first 4 + last N tokens) match or exceed learned approaches; (2) prefill attention provides equivalent signal to complex learned scorers; (3) marginal information in KV representations beyond position and prefill attention appears limited for importance prediction. We hypothesize that circular dependence between future queries and generation trajectories contributes to this difficulty.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14279v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hallucination-Free Automatic Question &amp; Answer Generation for Intuitive Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14280</link><description>arXiv:2601.14280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), defined as fluent yet incorrect or incoherent outputs, pose a significant challenge to the automatic generation of educational multiple-choice questions (MCQs). We identified four key hallucination types in MCQ generation: reasoning inconsistencies, insolvability, factual errors, and mathematical errors. To address this, we propose a hallucination-free multi-agent generation framework that breaks down MCQ generation into discrete, verifiable stages. Our framework utilizes both rule-based and LLM-based detection agents, as well as hallucination scoring metrics to optimize question quality. We redefined MCQ generation as an optimization task minimizing hallucination risk while maximizing validity, answerability, and cost-efficiency. We also introduce an agent-led refinement process that uses counterfactual reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) to iteratively improve hallucination in question generation. We evaluated a sample of AP- aligned STEM questions, where our system reduced hallucination rates by over 90% compared to baseline generation while preserving the educational value and style of questions. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent collaboration can mitigate hallucinations in educational content creation at scale, paving the way for more reliable LLM-powered learning tools.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14280v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Affinity: A Benchmark of 1D, 2D, and 3D Methods Reveals Critical Trade-offs in Structure-Based Drug Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14283</link><description>arXiv:2601.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the field of structure-based drug design is dominated by three main types of algorithms: search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning. While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

Abstract: Traditional technology mapping suffers from systemic inaccuracies in delay estimation due to its reliance on abstract, technology-agnostic delay models that fail to capture the nuanced timing behavior behavior of real post-mapping circuits. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce GPA(graph neural network (GNN)-based Path-Aware multi-view circuit learning), a novel GNN framework that learns precise, data-driven delay predictions by synergistically fusing three complementary views of circuit structure: And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs)-based functional encoding, post-mapping technology emphasizes critical timing paths. Trained exclusively on real cell delays extracted from critical paths of industrial-grade post-mapping netlists, GPA learns to classify cut delays with unprecedented accuracy, directly informing smarter mapping decisions. Evaluated on the 19 EPFL combinational benchmarks, GPA achieves 19.9%, 2.1% and 4.1% average delay reduction over the conventional heuristics methods (techmap, MCH) and the prior state-of-the-art ML-based approach SLAP, respectively-without compromising area efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14286v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Chain-of-Memory: Lightweight Memory Construction with Dynamic Evolution for LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14287</link><description>arXiv:2601.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External memory systems are pivotal for enabling Large Language Model (LLM) agents to maintain persistent knowledge and perform long-horizon decision-making. Existing paradigms typically follow a two-stage process: computationally expensive memory construction (e.g., structuring data into graphs) followed by naive retrieval-augmented generation. However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization. CoM introduces a Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution, utilizing adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise. Extensive experiments on the LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks demonstrate that CoM outperforms strong baselines with accuracy gains of 7.5%-10.4%, while drastically reducing computational overhead to approximately 2.7% of token consumption and 6.0% of latency compared to complex memory architectures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14287v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RPC-Bench: A Fine-grained Benchmark for Research Paper Comprehension</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14289</link><description>arXiv:2601.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding research papers remains challenging for foundation models due to specialized scientific discourse and complex figures and tables, yet existing benchmarks offer limited fine-grained evaluation at scale. To address this gap, we introduce RPC-Bench, a large-scale question-answering benchmark built from review-rebuttal exchanges of high-quality computer science papers, containing 15K human-verified QA pairs. We design a fine-grained taxonomy aligned with the scientific research flow to assess models' ability to understand and answer why, what, and how questions in scholarly contexts. We also define an elaborate LLM-human interaction annotation framework to support large-scale labeling and quality control. Following the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, we develop a scalable framework that evaluates models on correctness-completeness and conciseness, with high agreement to human judgment. Experiments reveal that even the strongest models (GPT-5) achieve only 68.2% correctness-completeness, dropping to 37.46% after conciseness adjustment, highlighting substantial gaps in precise academic paper understanding.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs, under 10B parameters) are attractive for private, on-device deployment, yet they frequently fail on strict constraint-satisfaction problems due to linear, overconfident reasoning traces that do not recover from early mistakes. We introduce Verifier-Guided Distillation, a training protocol that transfers the process of error repair - explicit conflict detection and backtracking - rather than only correct final answers. By training a 7B model on verified reasoning traces that include mistakes and self-corrections, we show that latent verification behavior can emerge in small models, enabling them to occasionally stop, detect contradictions, and revise earlier assumptions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14290v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Epistemic Constitutionalism Or: how to avoid coherence bias</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14295</link><description>arXiv:2601.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models increasingly function as artificial reasoners: they evaluate arguments, assign credibility, and express confidence. Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Agent Simulation to Social Simulator: A Comprehensive Review (Part 2)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14296</link><description>arXiv:2601.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of system complexity primarily has two objectives: to explore underlying patterns and to develop theoretical explanations. Pattern exploration seeks to clarify the mechanisms behind the emergence of system complexity, while theoretical explanations aim to identify the fundamental causes of this complexity. Laws are generally defined as mappings between variables, whereas theories offer causal explanations of system behavior. Agent Based Modeling(ABM) is an important approach for studying complex systems, but it tends to emphasize simulation over experimentation. As a result, ABM often struggles to deeply uncover the governing operational principles. Unlike conventional scenario analysis that relies on human reasoning, computational experiments emphasize counterfactual experiments-that is, creating parallel worlds that simulate alternative "evolutionary paths" of real-world events. By systematically adjusting input variables and observing the resulting changes in output variables, computational experiments provide a robust tool for causal inference, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional ABM. Together, these methods offer causal insights into the dynamic evolution of systems. This part can help readers gain a preliminary understanding of the entire computational experiment method, laying the foundation for the subsequent study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14296v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Guardrails for trust, safety, and ethical development and deployment of Large Language Models (LLM)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14298</link><description>arXiv:2601.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI era has ushered in Large Language Models (LLM) to the technological forefront, which has been much of the talk in 2023, and is likely to remain as such for many years to come. LLMs are the AI models that are the power house behind generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. These AI models, fueled by vast amounts of data and computational prowess, have unlocked remarkable capabilities, from human-like text generation to assisting with natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. They have quickly become the foundation upon which countless applications and software services are being built, or at least being augmented with. However, as with any groundbreaking innovations, the rise of LLMs brings forth critical safety, privacy, and ethical concerns. These models are found to have a propensity to leak private information, produce false information, and can be coerced into generating content that can be used for nefarious purposes by bad actors, or even by regular users unknowingly. Implementing safeguards and guardrailing techniques is imperative for applications to ensure that the content generated by LLMs are safe, secure, and ethical. Thus, frameworks to deploy mechanisms that prevent misuse of these models via application implementations is imperative. In this study, wepropose a Flexible Adaptive Sequencing mechanism with trust and safety modules, that can be used to implement safety guardrails for the development and deployment of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14298v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Tail-Risk Escalation in IDS Alert Time Series</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14299</link><description>arXiv:2601.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network defenders face a steady stream of attacks, observed as raw Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts. The sheer volume of alerts demands prioritization, typically based on high-level risk classifications. This work expands the scope of risk measurement by examining alerts not only through their technical characteristics but also by examining and classifying their temporal patterns. One critical issue in responding to intrusion alerts is determining whether an alert is part of an escalating attack pattern or an opportunistic scan. To identify the former, we apply extreme-regime forecasting methods from financial modeling to IDS data. Extreme-regime forecasting is designed to identify likely future high-impact events or significant shifts in system behavior. Using these methods, we examine attack patterns by computing per-minute alert intensity, volatility, and a short-term momentum measure derived from weighted moving averages.
  We evaluate the efficacy of a supervised learning model for forecasting future escalation patterns using these derived features. The trained model identifies future high-intensity attacks and demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving approximately 91\% accuracy, 89\% recall, and 98\% precision. Our contributions provide a temporal measurement framework for identifying future high-intensity attacks and demonstrate the presence of predictive early-warning signals within the temporal structure of IDS alert streams. We describe our methods in sufficient detail to enable reproduction using other IDS datasets. In addition, we make the trained models openly available to support further research. Finally, we introduce an interpretable visualization that enables defenders to generate early predictive warnings of elevated volumetric arrival risk.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14299v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gradient Structure Estimation under Label-Only Oracles via Spectral Sensitivity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14300</link><description>arXiv:2601.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard-label black-box settings, where only top-1 predicted labels are observable, pose a fundamentally constrained yet practically important feedback model for understanding model behavior. A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\%$ detection rate.

Abstract: Image transmission and processing systems in resource-critical applications face significant challenges from adversarial perturbations that compromise mission-specific object classification. Current robustness testing methods require excessive computational resources through exhaustive frame-by-frame processing and full-image perturbations, proving impractical for large-scale deployments where massive image streams demand immediate processing. This paper presents DDSA (Dual-Domain Strategic Attack), a resource-efficient adversarial robustness testing framework that optimizes testing through temporal selectivity and spatial precision. We introduce a scenario-aware trigger function that identifies critical frames requiring robustness evaluation based on class priority and model uncertainty, and employ explainable AI techniques to locate influential pixel regions for targeted perturbation. Our dual-domain approach achieves substantial temporal-spatial resource conservation while maintaining attack effectiveness. The framework enables practical deployment of comprehensive adversarial robustness testing in resource-constrained real-time applications where computational efficiency directly impacts mission success.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14302v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Guided by the Plan: Enhancing Faithful Autoregressive Text-to-Audio Generation with Guided Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14304</link><description>arXiv:2601.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models excel at generating temporally coherent audio by producing tokens sequentially, yet they often falter in faithfully following complex textual prompts, especially those describing complex sound events. We uncover a surprising capability in AR audio generators: their early prefix tokens implicitly encode global semantic attributes of the final output, such as event count and sound-object category, revealing a form of implicit planning. Building on this insight, we propose Plan-Critic, a lightweight auxiliary model trained with a Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)-inspired objective to predict final instruction-following quality from partial generations. At inference time, Plan-Critic enables guided exploration: it evaluates candidate prefixes early, prunes low-fidelity trajectories, and reallocates computation to high-potential planning seeds. Our Plan-Critic-guided sampling achieves up to a 10-point improvement in CLAP score over the AR baseline-establishing a new state of the art in AR text-to-audio generation-while maintaining computational parity with standard best-of-N decoding. This work bridges the gap between causal generation and global semantic alignment, demonstrating that even strictly autoregressive models can plan ahead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14304v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Optimized Decision Tree-Based Framework for Explainable IoT Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14305</link><description>arXiv:2601.14305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has tremendously increased the attack surface of cyber threats thus making a strong intrusion detection system (IDS) with a clear explanation of the process essential towards resource-constrained environments. Nevertheless, current IoT IDS systems are usually traded off with detection quality, model elucidability, and computational effectiveness, thus the deployment on IoT devices. The present paper counteracts these difficulties by suggesting an explainable AI (XAI) framework based on an optimized Decision Tree classifier with both local and global importance methods: SHAP values that estimate feature attribution using local explanations, and Morris sensitivity analysis that identifies the feature importance in a global view. The proposed system attains the state of art on the test performance with 99.91% accuracy, F1-score of 99.51% and Cohen Kappa of 0.9960 and high stability is confirmed by a cross validation mean accuracy of 98.93%. Efficiency is also enhanced in terms of computations to provide faster inferences compared to those that are generalized in ensemble models. SrcMac has shown as the most significant predictor in feature analyses according to SHAP and Morris methods. Compared to the previous work, our solution eliminates its major drawback lack because it allows us to apply it to edge devices and, therefore, achieve real-time processing, adhere to the new regulation of transparency in AI, and achieve high detection rates on attacks of dissimilar classes. This combination performance of high accuracy, explainability, and low computation make the framework useful and reliable as a resource-constrained IoT security problem in real environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14305v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CORVUS: Red-Teaming Hallucination Detectors via Internal Signal Camouflage in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14310</link><description>arXiv:2601.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-pass hallucination detectors rely on internal telemetry (e.g., uncertainty, hidden-state geometry, and attention) of large language models, implicitly assuming hallucinations leave separable traces in these signals.

Trained on 1,000 out-of-distribution Alpaca instructions (&lt;0.5% trainable parameters), CORVUS transfers to FAVA-Annotation across Llama-2, Vicuna, Llama-3, and Qwen2.5, and degrades both training-free detectors (e.g., LLM-Check) and probe-based detectors (e.g., SEP, ICR-probe), motivating adversary-aware auditing that incorporates external grounding or cross-model evidence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14310v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tracing the Data Trail: A Survey of Data Provenance, Transparency and Traceability in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14311</link><description>arXiv:2601.14311v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: This work presents two integration methods for field transfer in computational aeroacoustics and in coupled field problems, using the finite element method to solve the acoustic field. Firstly, a high-order Gaussian quadrature computes the finite element right-hand side. In contrast, the (flow) field provided by the finite difference mesh is mapped by higher-order B-Splines or a Lagrangian function. Secondly, the cut-cell or supermesh integration with geometric clipping. For each method, the accuracy, performance characteristics, and computational complexity are analyzed. As a reference, the trapezoidal integration rule was computed from the finite difference results. The high-order quadrature converges as the B-Spline interpolation order increases, and the finite difference results and mesh resolutions are consistent. The supermesh approach eliminates interpolation and approximation errors at the grid-to-mesh level and improves accuracy. This behaviour is universal for smooth or strongly oscillating field quantities, which will be shown in a comparative study between the Lighthill-like source term and the source term of the perturbed convective wave equation for subsonic flows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14320v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SilentDrift: Exploiting Action Chunking for Stealthy Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14323</link><description>arXiv:2601.14323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical robotic applications, yet their security vulnerabilities remain underexplored. We identify a fundamental security flaw in modern VLA systems: the combination of action chunking and delta pose representations creates an intra-chunk visual open-loop. This mechanism forces the robot to execute K-step action sequences, allowing per-step perturbations to accumulate through integration. We propose SILENTDRIFT, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack exploiting this vulnerability. Our method employs the Smootherstep function to construct perturbations with guaranteed C2 continuity, ensuring zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries to satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints. Furthermore, our keyframe attack strategy selectively poisons only the critical approach phase, maximizing impact while minimizing trigger exposure. The resulting poisoned trajectories are visually indistinguishable from successful demonstrations. Evaluated on the LIBERO, SILENTDRIFT achieves a 93.2% Attack Success Rate with a poisoning rate under 2%, while maintaining a 95.3% Clean Task Success Rate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14323v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Generative AI Is Intimate, Sexy, and Violent: Examining Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) Chatbots on FlowGPT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14324</link><description>arXiv:2601.14324v1 Announce Type: new

Drawing on the functional theory of NSFW on social media, this study analyzes 376 NSFW chatbots and 307 public conversation sessions on FlowGPT. Findings identify four chatbot types: roleplay characters, story generators, image generators, and do-anything-now bots. AI Characters portraying fantasy personas and enabling hangout-style interactions are most common, often using explicit avatar images to invite engagement. Sexual, violent, and insulting content appears in both user prompts and chatbot outputs, with some chatbots generating explicit material even when users do not create erotic prompts. In sum, the NSFW experience on FlowGPT can be understood as a combination of virtual intimacy, sexual delusion, violent thought expression, and unsafe content acquisition. We conclude with implications for chatbot design, creator support, user safety, and content moderation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Layer-adaptive Expert Pruning for Pre-Training of Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14327</link><description>arXiv:2601.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver superior accuracy with a reduced number of active parameters, their pre-training represents a significant computationally bottleneck due to underutilized experts and limited training efficiency. This work introduces a Layer-Adaptive Expert Pruning (LAEP) algorithm designed for the pre-training stage of MoE LLMs. In contrast to previous expert pruning approaches that operate primarily in the post-training phase, the proposed algorithm enhances training efficiency by selectively pruning underutilized experts and reorganizing experts across computing devices according to token distribution statistics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LAEP effectively reduces model size and substantially improves pre-training efficiency. In particular, when pre-training the 1010B Base model from scratch, LAEP achieves a 48.3\% improvement in training efficiency alongside a 33.3% parameter reduction, while still delivering excellent performance across multiple domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14327v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LURE: Latent Space Unblocking for Multi-Concept Reawakening in Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14330</link><description>arXiv:2601.14330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept erasure aims to suppress sensitive content in diffusion models, but recent studies show that erased concepts can still be reawakened, revealing vulnerabilities in erasure methods. Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14330v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Long-Term Self-Rated Health in Small Areas Using Ordinal Regression and Microsimulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14335</link><description>arXiv:2601.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for predicting the self-rated health of individuals in a future population utilising the individuals' socio-economic characteristics. An open-source microsimulation is used to project Ireland's population into the future where each individual is defined by a number of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The model is disaggregated spatially at the Electoral Division level, allowing for analysis of results at that, or any broader geographical scales. Ordinal regression is utilised to predict an individual's self-rated health based on their socio-economic characteristics and this method is shown to match well to Ireland's 2022 distribution of health statuses. Due to differences in the health status distributions of the health microdata and the national data, an alignment technique is proposed to bring predictions closer to real values. It is illustrated for one potential future population that the effects of an ageing population may outweigh other improvements in socio-economic outcomes to disimprove Ireland's mean self-rated health slightly. Health modelling at this kind of granular scale could offer local authorities a chance to predict and combat health issues which may arise in their local populations in the future.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14335v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Log anomaly detection via Meta Learning and Prototypical Networks for Cross domain generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14336</link><description>arXiv:2601.14336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Log anomaly detection is essential for system reliability, but it is extremely challenging to do considering it involves class imbalance. Additionally, the models trained in one domain are not applicable to other domains, necessitating the need for cross-domain adaptation (such as HDFS and Linux). Traditional detection models often fail to generalize due to significant data drift and the inherent absence of labeled anomalies in new target domains. To handle the above challenges, we proposed a new end-to-end framework based on a meta-learning approach. Our methodology first gets the data ready by combining a Drain3 log parsing mechanism with a dynamic drift-based labeling technique that uses semantic and fuzzy matching to move existing anomaly knowledge from one source to another. BERT-based semantic embeddings are obtained, and the feature selection is invoked to reduce the dimensionality. Later, Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Prototypical Networks models are trained to adapt quickly and effectively. The SMOTE oversampling method is employed to handle imbalances in the data. All the results are obtained by employing the leave-one-out source method, and the corresponding mean F1 scores are reported. Our empirical findings validate that the proposed meta-learning-driven approach yielded the highest mean F1 score and proved to be effective for cross-domain settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14336v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CityCube: Benchmarking Cross-view Spatial Reasoning on Vision-Language Models in Urban Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14339</link><description>arXiv:2601.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-view spatial reasoning is essential for embodied AI, underpinning spatial understanding, mental simulation and planning in complex environments. Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark. Further analyses indicate the task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparity between VLMs and human-like reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14339v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Turn-Based Structural Triggers: Prompt-Free Backdoors in Multi-Turn LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14340</link><description>arXiv:2601.14340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely integrated into interactive systems such as dialogue agents and task-oriented assistants. This growing ecosystem also raises supply-chain risks, where adversaries can distribute poisoned models that degrade downstream reliability and user trust. Existing backdoor attacks and defenses are largely prompt-centric, focusing on user-visible triggers while overlooking structural signals in multi-turn conversations. We propose Turn-based Structural Trigger (TST), a backdoor attack that activates from dialogue structure, using the turn index as the trigger and remaining independent of user inputs. Across four widely used open-source LLM models, TST achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 99.52% with minimal utility degradation, and remains effective under five representative defenses with an average ASR of 98.04%. The attack also generalizes well across instruction datasets, maintaining an average ASR of 99.19%. Our results suggest that dialogue structure constitutes an important and under-studied attack surface for multi-turn LLM systems, motivating structure-aware auditing and mitigation in practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14340v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking On-Device LLM Reasoning: Why Analogical Mapping Outperforms Abstract Thinking for IoT DDoS Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14343</link><description>arXiv:2601.14343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT deployments has intensified cybersecurity threats, notably Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, characterized by increasingly sophisticated patterns. Leveraging Generative AI through On-Device Large Language Models (ODLLMs) provides a viable solution for real-time threat detection at the network edge, though limited computational resources present challenges for smaller ODLLMs. This paper introduces a novel detection framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tailored specifically for IoT edge environments. We systematically evaluate compact ODLLMs, including LLaMA 3.2 (1B, 3B) and Gemma 3 (1B, 4B), using structured prompting and exemplar-driven reasoning strategies. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements with few-shot prompting, achieving macro-average F1 scores as high as 0.85. Our findings highlight the significant advantages of incorporating exemplar-based reasoning, underscoring that CoT and RAG approaches markedly enhance small ODLLMs' capabilities in accurately classifying complex network attacks under stringent resource constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14343v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiSPA: Differential Substructure-Pathway Attention for Drug Response Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14346</link><description>arXiv:2601.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug response in precision medicine requires models that capture how specific chemical substructures interact with cellular pathway states. However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Partner Project: COIN-3D -- Collaborative Innovation in 3D VLSI Reliability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14347</link><description>arXiv:2601.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As semiconductor manufacturing advances from the 3-nm process toward the sub-nanometer regime and transitions from FinFETs to gate-all-around field-effect transistors (GAAFETs), the resulting complexity and manufacturing challenges continue to increase. In this context, 3D chiplet-based approaches have emerged as key enablers to address these limitations while exploiting the expanded design space. Specifically, chiplets help address the lower yields typically associated with large monolithic designs. This paradigm enables the modular design of heterogeneous systems consisting of multiple chiplets (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, memory) fabricated using different technology nodes and processes. Consequently, it offers a capable and cost-effective strategy for designing heterogeneous systems. This paper introduces the Horizon Europe Twinning project COIN-3D (Collaborative Innovation in 3D VLSI Reliability), which aims to strengthen research excellence in 2.5D/3D VLSI systems reliability through collaboration between leading European institutions. More specifically, our primary scientific goal is the provision of novel open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools for reliability assessment of 3D systems, integrating advanced algorithms for physical- and system-level reliability analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14347v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Legal Retrieval for Public Defenders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14348</link><description>arXiv:2601.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI tools are increasingly suggested as solutions to assist public agencies with heavy workloads. In public defense, where a constitutional right to counsel meets the complexities of law, overwhelming caseloads and constrained resources, practitioners face especially taxing conditions. Yet, there is little evidence of how AI could meaningfully support defenders' day-to-day work. In partnership with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, we develop the NJ BriefBank, a retrieval tool which surfaces relevant appellate briefs to streamline legal research and writing. We show that existing legal retrieval benchmarks fail to transfer to public defense search, however adding domain knowledge improves retrieval quality. This includes query expansion with legal reasoning, domain-specific data and curated synthetic examples. To facilitate further research, we provide a taxonomy of realistic defender search queries and release a manually annotated public defense retrieval dataset. Together, our work offers starting points towards building practical, reliable retrieval AI tools for public defense, and towards more realistic legal retrieval benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14348v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MARBLE: Multi-Agent Reasoning for Bioinformatics Learning and Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14349</link><description>arXiv:2601.14349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Developing high-performing bioinformatics models typically requires repeated cycles of hypothesis formulation, architectural redesign, and empirical validation, making progress slow, labor-intensive, and difficult to reproduce. Although recent LLM-based assistants can automate isolated steps, they lack performance-grounded reasoning and stability-aware mechanisms required for reliable, iterative model improvement in bioinformatics workflows. Results: We introduce MARBLE, an execution-stable autonomous model refinement framework for bioinformatics models. MARBLE couples literature-aware reference selection with structured, debate-driven architectural reasoning among role-specialized agents, followed by autonomous execution, evaluation, and memory updates explicitly grounded in empirical performance. Across spatial transcriptomics domain segmentation, drug-target interaction prediction, and drug response prediction, MARBLE consistently achieves sustained performance improvements over strong baselines across multiple refinement cycles, while maintaining high execution robustness and low regression rates. Framework-level analyses demonstrate that structured debate, balanced evidence selection, and performance-grounded memory are critical for stable, repeatable model evolution, rather than single-run or brittle gains.

Abstract: AI Agents can perform complex operations at great speed, but just like all the humans we have ever hired, their intelligence remains fallible. Miscommunications aren't noticed, systemic biases have no counter-action, and inner monologues are rarely written down.
  We did not come to fire them for their mistakes, but to hire them and provide a safe productive working environment. We posit that we can reuse a common corporate organizational structure: teams of independent AI agents with strict role boundaries can work with common goals, but opposing incentives. Multiple models serving as a team of rivals can catch and minimize errors within the final product at a small cost to the velocity of actions. In this paper we demonstrate that we can achieve reliability without acquiring perfect components, but through careful orchestration of imperfect ones.
  This paper describes the architecture of such a system in practice: specialized agent teams (planners, executors, critics, experts), organized into an organization with clear goals, coordinated through a remote code executor that keeps data transformations and tool invocations separate from reasoning models. Rather than agents directly calling tools and ingesting full responses, they write code that executes remotely; only relevant summaries return to agent context. By preventing raw data and tool outputs from contaminating context windows, the system maintains clean separation between perception (brains that plan and reason) and execution (hands that perform heavy data transformations and API calls). We demonstrate the approach achieves over 90% internal error interception prior to user exposure while maintaining acceptable latency tradeoffs. A survey from our traces shows that we only trade off cost and latency to achieve correctness and incrementally expand capabilities without impacting existing ones.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14351v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RoboBrain 2.5: Depth in Sight, Time in Mind</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14352</link><description>arXiv:2601.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce RoboBrain 2.5, a next-generation embodied AI foundation model that advances general perception, spatial reasoning, and temporal modeling through extensive training on high-quality spatiotemporal supervision. Building upon its predecessor, RoboBrain 2.5 introduces two major capability upgrades. Specifically, it unlocks Precise 3D Spatial Reasoning by shifting from 2D pixel-relative grounding to depth-aware coordinate prediction and absolute metric constraint comprehension, generating complete 3D manipulation traces as ordered keypoint sequences under physical constraints. Complementing this spatial precision, the model establishes Dense Temporal Value Estimation that provides dense, step-aware progress prediction and execution state understanding across varying viewpoints, producing stable feedback signals for downstream learning. Together, these upgrades extend the framework toward more physically grounded and execution-aware embodied intelligence for complex, fine-grained manipulation.

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a scalable paradigm for self-supervised learning by predicting latent representations rather than reconstructing high-entropy observations. However, existing formulations rely on \textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14354v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Single-step Controllable Music Bandwidth Extension With Flow Matching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14356</link><description>arXiv:2601.14356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio restoration consists in inverting degradations of a digital audio signal to recover what would have been the pristine quality signal before the degradation occurred. This is valuable in contexts such as archives of music recordings, particularly those of precious historical value, for which a clean version may have been lost or simply does not exist. Recent work applied generative models to audio restoration, showing promising improvement over previous methods, and opening the door to the ability to perform restoration operations that were not possible before. However, making these models finely controllable remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an extension of FLowHigh and introduce the Dynamic Spectral Contour (DSC) as a control signal for bandwidth extension via classifier-free guidance. Our experiments show competitive model performance, and indicate that DSC is a promising feature to support fine-grained conditioning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14356v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recursivism: An Artistic Paradigm for Self-Transforming Art in the Age of AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14401</link><description>arXiv:2601.14401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces Recursivism as a conceptual framework for analyzing contemporary artistic practices in the age of artificial intelligence. While recursion is precisely defined in mathematics and computer science, it has not previously been formalized as an aesthetic paradigm. Recursivism designates practices in which not only outputs vary over time, but in which the generative process itself becomes capable of reflexive modification through its own effects.
  The paper develops a five-level analytical scale distinguishing simple iteration, cumulative iteration, parametric recursion, reflexive recursion, and meta-recursion. This scale clarifies the threshold at which a system shifts from variation within a fixed rule to genuine self-modification of the rule itself. From this perspective, art history is reinterpreted as a recursive dynamic alternating between internal recursion within movements and meta-recursive transformations of their generative principles.
  Artificial intelligence renders this logic technically explicit through learning loops, parameter updates, and code-level self-modification. To distinguish Recursivism from related notions such as generative art, cybernetics, process art, and evolutionary art, the article proposes three operational criteria: state memory, rule evolvability, and reflexive visibility. These concepts are examined through case studies including Refik Anadol, Sougwen Chung, Karl Sims, and the Darwin-Godel Machine. The article concludes by examining the aesthetic, curatorial, and ethical implications of self-modifying artistic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14401v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Framework for Scalable and Robust Paper Assignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14402</link><description>arXiv:2601.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assigning papers to reviewers is a central challenge in the peer-review process of large academic conferences. Program chairs must balance competing objectives, including maximizing reviewer expertise, promoting diversity, and enhancing robustness to strategic manipulation, but it is challenging to do so at the modern conference scale.
  Existing algorithmic paper assignment approaches either fail to address all of these goals simultaneously or suffer from poor scalability. To address the limitation, we propose Robust Assignment via Marginal Perturbation (RAMP), a unified framework for large-scale peer review. Our approach formulates a linearized perturbed-maximization objective with soft constraints that flexibly balance assignment quality, diversity, and robustness while maintaining runtime efficiency. We further introduce an attribute-aware sampling procedure that converts fractional solutions into integral assignments and improves the diversity and robustness of the final assignment. On datasets with over 20,000 papers and 20,000 reviewers, RAMP runs in under 20 minutes, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14402v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A low-order hybrid method for the variable-density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14405</link><description>arXiv:2601.14405v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Large-scale medical segmentation datasets often combine manual and pseudo-labels of uneven quality, which can compromise training and evaluation. Low-quality labels may hamper performance and make the model training less robust. To address this issue, we propose SegAE (Segmentation Assessment Engine), a lightweight vision-language model (VLM) that automatically predicts label quality across 142 anatomical structures. Trained on over four million image-label pairs with quality scores, SegAE achieves a high correlation coefficient of 0.902 with ground-truth Dice similarity and evaluates a 3D mask in 0.06s. SegAE shows several practical benefits: (I) Our analysis reveals widespread low-quality labeling across public datasets; (II) SegAE improves data efficiency and training performance in active and semi-supervised learning, reducing dataset annotation cost by one-third and quality-checking time by 70% per label. This tool provides a simple and effective solution for quality control in large-scale medical segmentation datasets.

Abstract: This survey reviews the existing and envisioned security vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms relevant to Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) systems, with a focus on electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.

The paper also highlights key threat vectors, including Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming/spoofing, ATC radio frequency misuse, attacks on TCAS and ADS-B, possible backdoor via Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), new vulnerabilities introduced by aircraft automation and connectivity, and risks from flight management system (FMS) software, database and cloud services. Finally, this paper describes emerging defense techniques against these attacks, and open technical problems to address toward better defense mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14415v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantifying Speaker Embedding Phonological Rule Interactions in Accented Speech Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14417</link><description>arXiv:2601.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many spoken languages, including English, exhibit wide variation in dialects and accents, making accent control an important capability for flexible text-to-speech (TTS) models. Current TTS systems typically generate accented speech by conditioning on speaker embeddings associated with specific accents. While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as embeddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), a novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations. Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity. Our findings highlight rules as a lever for accent control and a framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14417v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimising Cylindrical Algebraic Coverings for use in SMT by Solving a Set Covering Problem with Reasons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14424</link><description>arXiv:2601.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Conflict-Driven Cylindrical Algebraic Covering algorithm has proven well suited for performing theory validation checks in the satisfiability modulo theories paradigm for non-linear real arithmetic. CDCAC repurposes the theory underpinning classical cylindrical algebraic decomposition for SMT solving and is implemented in the SMT solvers cvc5 and SMT-RAT, as well as the computer algebra system Maple. It was previously observed that when using cylindrical algebraic decomposition for an SMT theory call, the output can be optimised by solving a single set covering problem instance that minimises the conflict clause. In this paper we consider the corresponding optimisation for CDCAC and observe that CDCAC naturally gives rise to multiple such optimisations within a single call. Each time a covering is generalised in one dimension, the resulting cell in the next dimension is labelled with theory constraints that cannot be satisfied together. We seek the smallest subset of constraints whose union covers all labels from the cells in the current covering. We call this optimisation problem a set covering problem with reasons. To simplify this problem, we introduce a data reduction step that generalises Beasley reduction for the classical set covering problem and show that this step alone solves many of the instances arising from SMT-LIB benchmarks. We then propose an exact solver based on linear programming to efficiently solve the remaining cases. Integrating these techniques into CDCAC has the potential to significantly improve SMT solver performance for non-linear real arithmetic problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Measuring the State of Open Science in Transportation Using Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14429</link><description>arXiv:2601.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open science initiatives have strengthened scientific integrity and accelerated research progress across many fields, but the state of their practice within transportation research remains under-investigated. Key features of open science, defined here as data and code availability, are difficult to extract due to the inherent complexity of the field. Previous work has either been limited to small-scale studies due to the labor-intensive nature of manual analysis or has relied on large-scale bibliometric approaches that sacrifice contextual richness. This paper introduces an automatic and scalable feature-extraction pipeline to measure data and code availability in transportation research. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task and validate their performance against a manually curated dataset and through an inter-rater agreement analysis. We applied this pipeline to examine 10,724 research articles published in the Transportation Research Part series of journals between 2019 and 2024. Our analysis found that only 5% of quantitative papers shared a code repository, 4% of quantitative papers shared a data repository, and about 3% of papers shared both, with trends differing across journals, topics, and geographic regions. We found no significant difference in citation counts or review duration between papers that provided data and code and those that did not, suggesting a misalignment between open science efforts and traditional academic metrics. Consequently, encouraging these practices will likely require structural interventions from journals and funding agencies to supplement the lack of direct author incentives. The pipeline developed in this study can be readily scaled to other journals, representing a critical step toward the automated measurement and monitoring of open science practices in transportation research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14429v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CMind: An AI Agent for Localizing C Memory Bugs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14434</link><description>arXiv:2601.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This demonstration paper presents CMind, an artificial intelligence agent for localizing C memory bugs. The novel aspect to CMind is that it follows steps that we observed human programmers perform during empirical study of those programmers finding memory bugs in C programs. The input to the tool is a C program's source code and a bug report describing the problem. The output is the tool's hypothesis about the reason for the bug and its location. CMind reads the bug report to find potential entry points to the program, then navigates the program's source code, analyzes that source code, and generates a hypothesis location and rationale that fit a template. The tool combines large language model reasoning with guided decision making we encoded to mimic human behavior.

Abstract: The integration of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs) with autonomous reasoning, planning, and execution, into unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms opens new operational possibilities and brings the vision of the Internet of Drones closer to reality. However, infrastructure constraints, dynamic environments, and the computational demands of multi-agent coordination limit real-world deployment in high-risk scenarios such as wildfires and disaster response. This paper investigates the integration of LLM-based agentic AI and edge computing to realize scalable and resilient autonomy in UAV swarms. We first discuss three architectures for supporting UAV swarms - standalone, edge-enabled, and edge-cloud hybrid deployment - each optimized for varying autonomy and connectivity levels. Then, a use case for wildfire search and rescue (SAR) is designed to demonstrate the efficiency of the edge-enabled architecture, enabling high SAR coverage, reduced mission completion times, and a higher level of autonomy compared to traditional approaches. Finally, we highlight open challenges in integrating LLMs and edge computing for mission-critical UAV-swarm applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14437v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vision-Based Natural Language Scene Understanding for Autonomous Driving: An Extended Dataset and a New Model for Traffic Scene Description Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14438</link><description>arXiv:2601.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic scene understanding is essential for enabling autonomous vehicles to accurately perceive and interpret their environment, thereby ensuring safe navigation. This paper presents a novel framework that transforms a single frontal-view camera image into a concise natural language description, effectively capturing spatial layouts, semantic relationships, and driving-relevant cues. The proposed model leverages a hybrid attention mechanism to enhance spatial and semantic feature extraction and integrates these features to generate contextually rich and detailed scene descriptions. To address the limited availability of specialized datasets in this domain, a new dataset derived from the BDD100K dataset has been developed, with comprehensive guidelines provided for its construction. Furthermore, the study offers an in-depth discussion of relevant evaluation metrics, identifying the most appropriate measures for this task. Extensive quantitative evaluations using metrics such as CIDEr and SPICE, complemented by human judgment assessments, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves strong performance and effectively fulfills its intended objectives on the newly developed dataset.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VisTIRA: Closing the Image-Text Modality Gap in Visual Math Reasoning via Structured Tool Integration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14440</link><description>arXiv:2601.14440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) lag behind text-only language models on mathematical reasoning when the same problems are presented as images rather than text. We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14440v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion Large Language Models for Black-Box Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14446</link><description>arXiv:2601.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline black-box optimization (BBO) aims to find optimal designs based solely on an offline dataset of designs and their labels. Such scenarios frequently arise in domains like DNA sequence design and robotics, where only a few labeled data points are available. Traditional methods typically rely on task-specific proxy or generative models, overlooking the in-context learning capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts have adapted autoregressive LLMs to BBO by framing task descriptions and offline datasets as natural language prompts, enabling direct design generation. However, these designs often contain bidirectional dependencies, which left-to-right models struggle to capture. In this paper, we explore diffusion LLMs for BBO, leveraging their bidirectional modeling and iterative refinement capabilities. This motivates our in-context denoising module: we condition the diffusion LLM on the task description and the offline dataset, both formatted in natural language, and prompt it to denoise masked designs into improved candidates. To guide the generation toward high-performing designs, we introduce masked diffusion tree search, which casts the denoising process as a step-wise Monte Carlo Tree Search that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation. Each node represents a partially masked design, each denoising step is an action, and candidates are evaluated via expected improvement under a Gaussian Process trained on the offline dataset. Our method, dLLM, achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot settings on design-bench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14446v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gaussian Based Adaptive Multi-Modal 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14448</link><description>arXiv:2601.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sparse object detection paradigm shift towards dense 3D semantic occupancy prediction is necessary for dealing with long-tail safety challenges for autonomous vehicles. Nonetheless, the current voxelization methods commonly suffer from excessive computation complexity demands, where the fusion process is brittle, static, and breaks down under dynamic environmental settings. To this end, this research work enhances a novel Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR multimodal 3D occupancy prediction model that seamlessly bridges the semantic strengths of camera modality with the geometric strengths of LiDAR modality through a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian model. The proposed solution has four key components: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), where depth-wise deformable sampling is employed for dealing with geometric sparsity, (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, where cross-entropy is employed for handling domain-specific noise, (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, where dynamic recalibration of sensor outputs is performed based on model outputs, and (4) Gauss-Mamba Head that uses Selective State Space Models for global context decoding that enjoys linear computation complexity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14448v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unpacking Security Scanners for GitHub Actions Workflows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14455</link><description>arXiv:2601.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GitHub Actions is a widely used platform that allows developers to automate the build and deployment of their projects through configurable workflows. As the platform's popularity continues to grow, it has become a target of choice for recent software supply chain attacks. These attacks exploit excessive permissions, ambiguous versions, or the absence of artifact integrity checks to compromise workflows. In response to these attacks, several security scanners have emerged to help developers harden their workflows.
  In this paper, we perform the first systematic comparison of 9 GitHub Actions workflow security scanners. We compare them in terms of scope (which security weaknesses they target), detection capabilities (how many weaknesses they detect), and usability (how long they take to scan a workflow). To compare scanners on a common ground, we first establish a taxonomy of 10 security weaknesses that can occur in GitHub Actions workflows. Then, we run the scanners against a curated set of 596 workflows.
  Our study reveals that the landscape of GitHub Actions workflow security scanners is diverse, with both broad-scope tools and very focused ones. More importantly, we show that scanners interpret security weaknesses differently, leading to significant differences in the type and number of reported weaknesses. Based on this empirical evidence, we make actionable recommendations for developers to harden their GitHub Actions workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14455v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Generalization Gap in LLM Planning: Tests and Verifier-Reward RL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14456</link><description>arXiv:2601.14456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work shows that fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve high valid plan rates on PDDL planning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14456v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trust Me on This: A User Study of Trustworthiness for RAG Responses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14460</link><description>arXiv:2601.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of generative AI into information access systems often presents users with synthesized answers that lack transparency. This study investigates how different types of explanations can influence user trust in responses from retrieval-augmented generation systems. We conducted a controlled, two-stage user study where participants chose the more trustworthy response from a pair-one objectively higher quality than the other-both with and without one of three explanation types: (1) source attribution, (2) factual grounding, and (3) information coverage. Our results show that while explanations significantly guide users toward selecting higher quality responses, trust is not dictated by objective quality alone: Users' judgments are also heavily influenced by response clarity, actionability, and their own prior knowledge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14460v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Variance Reduction in the Fokker-Planck Particle Method for Rarefied Gases using Quasi-Random Numbers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14461</link><description>arXiv:2601.14461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck (FP) particle method accelerates rarefied-gas simulations by replacing the binary collisions of the commonly used Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method with a drift=diffusion process. Like all particle methods, the FP method is inherently stochastic, which leads to statistical fluctuations in macroscopic quantities and necessitates large particle numbers for accurate results. In this work, we investigate the use of quasi-random numbers, which sample distributions more evenly and thereby reduce the variance. To preserve the low-discrepancy structure across time steps, we employ the Array Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo (Array-RQMC) technique. We combine the FP method with Array-RQMC and compare it in homogeneous and inhomogeneous problems with other commonly used variance-reduction techniques. The proposed FP-Array-RQMC approach achieves improved convergence rates compared with pseudo-random sampling and yields smaller estimator errors for sufficiently large particle numbers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14461v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] All-Pass Fractional OPF: A Solver-Friendly, Physics-Preserving Approximation of AC OPF</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14468</link><description>arXiv:2601.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fractional approximation of the AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem based on an all-pass approximation of the exponential power flow kernel. The classical AC OPF relies on trigonometric coupling between bus voltage phasors, which yields a nonconvex program with oscillatory derivatives that can slow, or in some cases destabilize, interior-point methods. We replace the trigonometric terms with an all-pass fractional (APF) approximation whose real and imaginary components act as smooth surrogates for the cosine and sine functions, and we introduce a pre-rotation to shift the argument of the approximation toward its most accurate region, ensuring that the reformulated power flow model preserves physical loss behavior, maintains the symmetry of the classical kernels, and improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The proposed APF OPF formulation remains nonconvex, as in the classical model, but it eliminates trigonometric evaluations and empirically produces larger and more stable Newton steps under standard interior-point solvers. Numerical results on more than 25 IEEE and PGLib test systems ranging from 9 to 10{,}000 buses demonstrate that the APF OPF model achieves solutions with accuracy comparable to that of the classical formulation while reducing solver times, indicating a more solver-friendly nonconvex representation of AC OPF.

Abstract: LLM-based Multi-Agent (LLM-MA) systems are increasingly applied to automate complex software engineering tasks such as requirements engineering, code generation, and testing. However, their operational efficiency and resource consumption remain poorly understood, hindering practical adoption due to unpredictable costs and environmental impact. To address this, we conduct an analysis of token consumption patterns in an LLM-MA system within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), aiming to understand where tokens are consumed across distinct software engineering activities. We analyze execution traces from 30 software development tasks performed by the ChatDev framework using a GPT-5 reasoning model, mapping its internal phases to distinct development stages (Design, Coding, Code Completion, Code Review, Testing, and Documentation) to create a standardized evaluation framework. We then quantify and compare token distribution (input, output, reasoning) across these stages.
  Our preliminary findings show that the iterative Code Review stage accounts for the majority of token consumption for an average of 59.4% of tokens. Furthermore, we observe that input tokens consistently constitute the largest share of consumption for an average of 53.9%, providing empirical evidence for potentially significant inefficiencies in agentic collaboration. Our results suggest that the primary cost of agentic software engineering lies not in initial code generation but in automated refinement and verification. Our novel methodology can help practitioners predict expenses and optimize workflows, and it directs future research toward developing more token-efficient agent collaboration protocols.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14470v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Prosody-Guided Harmonic Attention for Phase-Coherent Neural Vocoding in the Complex Spectrum</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14472</link><description>arXiv:2601.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural vocoders are central to speech synthesis; despite their success, most still suffer from limited prosody modeling and inaccurate phase reconstruction. We propose a vocoder that introduces prosody-guided harmonic attention to enhance voiced segment encoding and directly predicts complex spectral components for waveform synthesis via inverse STFT. Unlike mel-spectrogram-based approaches, our design jointly models magnitude and phase, ensuring phase coherence and improved pitch fidelity. To further align with perceptual quality, we adopt a multi-objective training strategy that integrates adversarial, spectral, and phase-aware losses. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent gains over HiFi-GAN and AutoVocoder: F0 RMSE reduced by 22 percent, voiced/unvoiced error lowered by 18 percent, and MOS scores improved by 0.15. These results show that prosody-guided attention combined with direct complex spectrum modeling yields more natural, pitch-accurate, and robust synthetic speech, setting a strong foundation for expressive neural vocoding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14472v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive KDE for Real-Time Thresholding: Prioritized Queues for Financial Crime Investigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14473</link><description>arXiv:2601.14473v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: High-altitude, multi-spectral, aerial imagery is scarce and expensive to acquire, yet it is necessary for algorithmic advances and application of machine learning models to high-impact problems such as wildfire detection. We introduce a human-annotated dataset from the NASA Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS) using 12-channel, medium to high altitude (3 - 50 km) aerial wildfire images similar to those used in current US wildfire missions. Our dataset combines spectral data from 12 different channels, including infrared (IR), short-wave IR (SWIR), and thermal. We take imagery from 20 wildfire missions and randomly sample small patches to generate over 4000 images with high variability, including occlusions by smoke/clouds, easily-confused false positives, and nighttime imagery.
  We demonstrate results from a deep-learning model to automate the human-intensive process of fire perimeter determination. We train two deep neural networks, one for image classification and the other for pixel-level segmentation. The networks are combined into a unique real-time segmentation model to efficiently localize active wildfire on an incoming image feed. Our model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union(IoU), and 84% recall surpassing past methods, including models trained on satellite data and classical color-rule algorithms. By leveraging a multi-spectral dataset, our model is able to detect active wildfire at nighttime and behind clouds, while distinguishing between false positives. We find that data from the SWIR, IR, and thermal bands is the most important to distinguish fire perimeters.

Abstract: Probabilistic computing using probabilistic bits (p-bits) presents an efficient alternative to traditional CMOS logic for complex problem-solving, including simulated annealing and machine learning. Realizing p-bits with emerging devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) introduces device variability, which was expected to negatively impact computational performance. However, this study reveals an unexpected finding: device variability can not only degrade but also enhance algorithm performance, particularly by leveraging timing variability. This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated, open-source simulated annealing framework based on p-bits that models key device variability factors -- timing, intensity, and offset -- to reflect real-world device behavior. Through CUDA-based simulations, our approach achieves a two-order magnitude speedup over CPU implementations on the MAX-CUT benchmark with problem sizes ranging from 800 to 20,000 nodes. By providing a scalable and accessible tool, this framework aims to advance research in probabilistic computing, enabling optimization applications in diverse fields.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14476v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] XD-MAP: Cross-Modal Domain Adaptation using Semantic Parametric Mapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14477</link><description>arXiv:2601.14477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until open-world foundation models match the performance of specialized approaches, the effectiveness of deep learning models remains heavily dependent on dataset availability. Training data must align not only with the target object categories but also with the sensor characteristics and modalities. To bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, domain adaptation strategies are widely used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to transferring sensor-specific knowledge from an image dataset to LiDAR, an entirely different sensing domain. Our method XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target domain without any manual annotation effort. Unlike previous domain transfer approaches, our method does not require direct overlap between sensors and enables extending the angular perception range from a front-view camera to a full 360 view. On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving strong performance on LiDAR data without any manual labeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14477v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Models for Large-Scale, Rigorous Qualitative Analysis in Applied Health Services Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14478</link><description>arXiv:2601.14478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for improving the efficiency of qualitative analysis in large, multi-site health-services research. Yet methodological guidance for LLM integration into qualitative analysis and evidence of their impact on real-world research methods and outcomes remain limited. We developed a model- and task-agnostic framework for designing human-LLM qualitative analysis methods to support diverse analytic aims. Within a multi-site study of diabetes care at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), we leveraged the framework to implement human-LLM methods for (1) qualitative synthesis of researcher-generated summaries to produce comparative feedback reports and (2) deductive coding of 167 interview transcripts to refine a practice-transformation intervention. LLM assistance enabled timely feedback to practitioners and the incorporation of large-scale qualitative data to inform theory and practice changes. This work demonstrates how LLMs can be integrated into applied health-services research to enhance efficiency while preserving rigor, offering guidance for continued innovation with LLMs in qualitative research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14478v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can LLM Reasoning Be Trusted? A Comparative Study: Using Human Benchmarking on Statistical Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14479</link><description>arXiv:2601.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve statistical tasks, as well as their capacity to assess the quality of reasoning. While state-of-the-art LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in a range of NLP tasks, their competence in addressing even moderately complex statistical challenges is not well understood. We have fine-tuned selected open-source LLMs on a specially developed dataset to enhance their statistical reasoning capabilities, and compared their performance with the human scores used as a benchmark. Our results show that the fine-tuned models achieve better performance on advanced statistical tasks on the level comparable to a statistics student. Fine-tuning demonstrates architecture-dependent improvements, with some models showing significant performance gains, indicating clear potential for deployment in educational technology and statistical analysis assistance systems. We also show that LLMs themselves can be far better judges of the answers quality (including explanation and reasoning assessment) in comparison to traditional metrics, such as BLEU or BertScore. This self-evaluation capability enables scalable automated assessment for statistical education platforms and quality assurance in automated analysis tools. Potential applications also include validation tools for research methodology in academic and industry settings, and quality control mechanisms for data analysis workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14479v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A benchmarking framework for PON-based fronthaul network design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14480</link><description>arXiv:2601.14480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As mobile networks transition toward 5G and 6G RAN architectures, Passive Optical Networks (PONs) offer a critical solution for cost-effective fronthaul transport. However, the lack of standardized evaluation models in current literature makes an objective comparison of diverse optimization strategies difficult. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a unified benchmarking framework that standardizes cost catalogs and deployment scenarios. We formulate the network design problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to establish optimality bounds and evaluate three scalable heuristic strategies: a Genetic Algorithm, K-Means Clustering (KMC+), and a graph-based Randomized Successive Splitter Assignment (RSSA+) algorithm. Simulation results show that a time-limited ILP remains a strong reference point, even when optimality is not reached. Despite being rarely used in prior fronthaul planning studies, it consistently yields solutions superior to those produced by standard heuristic methods. Among scalable approaches, RSSA+ reliably attains near-ILP performance while ensuring feasibility across all evaluated scenarios, which underscores the importance of advanced, constraint-aware algorithmic designs over simpler heuristics. The complete benchmarking framework and datasets are publicly shared in [1].</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14480v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Knee-Point Guided Activity Group Selection in Multi-Tree Genetic Programming for Dynamic Multi-Mode Project Scheduling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14485</link><description>arXiv:2601.14485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem is a challenging scheduling problem that requires making decisions on both the execution order of activities and their corresponding execution modes. Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14485v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stabilizing autoregressive forecasts in chaotic systems via multi-rate latent recurrence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14487</link><description>arXiv:2601.14487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon autoregressive forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems remains challenging due to rapid error amplification and distribution shift: small one-step inaccuracies compound into physically inconsistent rollouts and collapse of large-scale statistics. We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC &gt;= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC &gt;= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14487v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] High-Order Symmetric Positive Interior Quadrature Rules on Two and Three Dimensional Domains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14488</link><description>arXiv:2601.14488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully symmetric positive interior (f-SPI) quadrature rules are key building blocks for high-order discretizations of partial differential equations, yet high-degree rules with few nodes remain scarce on reference elements commonly used in mesh generation. We construct new f-SPI rules on the square, cube, prism, and pyramid by coupling a variable parameterization that enforces positivity and interiority with an efficient Levenberg-Marquardt optimization and a symmetry-aware node-reduction strategy that eliminates and collapses orbits, allowing transitions between symmetry types. The resulting rules achieve degrees up to 77 on the square, 45 on the cube, and 30 on the prism and pyramid, and for most degrees use fewer nodes than previously published f-SPI quadrature rules. Verification tests demonstrate comparable accuracy to existing rules. Complete node and weight data are also provided.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14488v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GutenOCR: A Grounded Vision-Language Front-End for Documents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14490</link><description>arXiv:2601.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GutenOCR is a family of grounded OCR front-ends obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. The resulting single-checkpoint vision-language models expose reading, detection, and grounding through a unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14490v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UNCLE-Grasp: Uncertainty-Aware Grasping of Leaf-Occluded Strawberries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14492</link><description>arXiv:2601.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic strawberry harvesting is challenging under partial occlusion, where leaves induce significant geometric uncertainty and make grasp decisions based on a single deterministic shape estimate unreliable. From a single partial observation, multiple incompatible 3D completions may be plausible, causing grasps that appear feasible on one completion to fail on another. We propose an uncertainty-aware grasping pipeline for partially occluded strawberries that explicitly models completion uncertainty arising from both occlusion and learned shape reconstruction. Our approach uses point cloud completion with Monte Carlo dropout to sample multiple shape hypotheses, generates candidate grasps for each completion, and evaluates grasp feasibility using physically grounded force-closure-based metrics. Rather than selecting a grasp based on a single estimate, we aggregate feasibility across completions and apply a conservative lower confidence bound (LCB) criterion to decide whether a grasp should be attempted or safely abstained. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and on a physical robot across increasing levels of synthetic and real leaf occlusion. Results show that uncertainty-aware decision making enables reliable abstention from high-risk grasp attempts under severe occlusion while maintaining robust grasp execution when geometric confidence is sufficient, outperforming deterministic baselines in both simulated and physical robot experiments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14492v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hint-Based SMT Proof Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14495</link><description>arXiv:2601.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several paradigms for integrating interactive and automated theorem provers, combining the convenience of powerful automation with strong soundness guarantees. We introduce a new approach for reconstructing proofs found by SMT solvers which we intend to be complementary with existing techniques. Rather than verifying or replaying a full proof produced by the SMT solver, or at the other extreme, rediscovering the solver's proof from just the set of premises it uses, we explore an approach which helps guide an interactive theorem prover's internal automation by leveraging derived facts during solving, which we call hints. This makes it possible to extract more information from the SMT solver's proof without the cost of retaining a dependency on the SMT solver itself. We implement a tactic in the Lean proof assistant, called QuerySMT, which leverages hints from the cvc5 SMT solver to improve existing Lean automation. We evaluate QuerySMT's performance on relevant Lean benchmarks, compare it to other tools available in Lean relating to SMT solving, and show that the hints generated by cvc5 produce a clear improvement in existing automation's performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14495v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AQUA: an Agile Process to Develop Quantum Annealing Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14501</link><description>arXiv:2601.14501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) is a field of operations research that is attracting growing interest due to the recent availability of quantum hardware targeted at solving QUBO problems. However, practical adoption is hindered by mathematical intricacy, hardware constraints, and a lack of sound software engineering processes for QUBO development. This work presents AQUA (Agile QUantum Annealing), an agile lifecycle for QUBO/QA development created through an industry-academia partnership between NetService S.p.A and the University of Cagliari. Using the Design Science Research (DSR) approach, AQUA customizes Scrum to the needs of QUBO/QA development, structuring work into four stages: initial assessment with formal modeling, prototype-driven algorithm selection, agile implementation, and deployment with ongoing maintenance, each gated by milestones. Validated on a real credit-scoring case, AQUA shows feasibility and offers an explicit, systematic QA engineering framework. Key contributions of our work are: a dedicated QUBO/QA software process, its creation and design using DSR approach, and its empirical validation on a simple yet real case study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14501v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Uncovering and Understanding FPR Manipulation Attack in Industrial IoT Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14505</link><description>arXiv:2601.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the network security domain, due to practical issues -- including imbalanced data and heterogeneous legitimate network traffic -- adversarial attacks in machine learning-based NIDSs have been viewed as attack packets misclassified as benign. Due to this prevailing belief, the possibility of (maliciously) perturbed benign packets being misclassified as attack has been largely ignored. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not only theoretically possible, but also a particular threat to NIDS. In particular, we uncover a practical cyberattack, FPR manipulation attack (FPA), especially targeting industrial IoT networks, where domain-specific knowledge of the widely used MQTT protocol is exploited and a systematic simple packet-level perturbation is performed to alter the labels of benign traffic samples without employing traditional gradient-based or non-gradient-based methods. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that this novel attack results in a success rate of 80.19% to 100%. In addition, while estimating impacts in the Security Operations Center, we observe that even a small fraction of false positive alerts, irrespective of different budget constraints and alert traffic intensities, can increase the delay of genuine alerts investigations up to 2 hr in a single day under normal operating conditions. Furthermore, a series of relevant statistical and XAI analyses is conducted to understand the key factors behind this remarkable success. Finally, we explore the effectiveness of the FPA packets to enhance models' robustness through adversarial training and investigate the changes in decision boundaries accordingly.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14505v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language, Caste, and Context: Demographic Disparities in AI-Generated Explanations Across Indian and American STEM Educational Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14506</link><description>arXiv:2601.14506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popularization of AI chatbot usage globally has created opportunities for research into their benefits and drawbacks, especially for students using AI assistants for coursework support. This paper asks: how do LLMs perceive the intellectual capabilities of student profiles from intersecting marginalized identities across different cultural contexts? We conduct one of the first large-scale intersectional analyses on LLM explanation quality for Indian and American undergraduate profiles preparing for engineering entrance examinations. By constructing profiles combining multiple demographic dimensions including caste, medium of instruction, and school boards in India, and race, HBCU attendance, and school type in America, alongside universal factors like income and college tier, we examine how quality varies across these factors. We observe biases providing lower-quality outputs to profiles with marginalized backgrounds in both contexts. LLMs such as Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct and GPT-4o demonstrate granular understandings of context-specific discrimination, systematically providing simpler explanations to Hindi/Regional-medium students in India and HBCU profiles in America, treating these as proxies for lower capability. Even when marginalized profiles attain social mobility by getting accepted into elite institutions, they still receive more simplistic explanations, showing how demographic information is inextricably linked to LLM biases. Different models (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-OSS 20B) embed similar biases against historically marginalized populations in both contexts, preventing profiles from switching between AI assistants for better results. Our findings have strong implications for AI incorporation into global engineering education.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14506v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Super Time Stepping Methods for Diffusion using Discontinuous-Galerkin Spatial Discretizations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14508</link><description>arXiv:2601.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-time-stepping (STS) methods provide an attractive approach for enabling explicit time integration of parabolic operators, particularly in large-scale, higher-dimensional kinetic simulations where fully implicit schemes are impractical. In this work, we present an explicit STS framework tailored for diffusion operators in gyrokinetic models, motivated by the fact that constructing and storing a Jacobian is often infeasible due to strong nonlocal couplings, high dimensionality, and memory constraints. We investigate the performance of several STS methods, including Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) and Runge-Kutta-Legendre (RKL) schemes, applied to a diffusion equation discretized using both discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and finite-difference methods. To support time adaptivity, we introduce a novel error norm designed to more accurately track temporal error arising from DG spatial discretizations, in which degrees of freedom contribute unevenly to the solution error. Finally, we assess the performance of an automatic eigenvalue estimation algorithm for determining the required number of STS stages and compare it against an analytical estimation formula.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14508v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Structured Image-based Coding for Efficient Gaussian Splatting Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14510</link><description>arXiv:2601.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art representation for radiance fields, combining real-time rendering with high visual fidelity. However, GS models require storing millions of parameters, leading to large file sizes that impair their use in practical multimedia systems. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GS Image-based Compression (GSICO), a novel GS codec that efficiently compresses pre-trained GS models while preserving perceptual fidelity. The core contribution lies in a mapping procedure that arranges GS parameters into structured images, guided by a novel algorithm that enhances spatial coherence. These GS parameter images are then encoded using a conventional image codec. Experimental evaluations on Tanks and Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets show that GSICO achieves average compression factors of 20.2x with minimal loss in visual quality, as measured by PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Compared with state-of-the-art GS compression methods, the proposed codec consistently yields superior rate-distortion (RD) trade-offs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14510v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Transparent Malware Detection With Granular Explainability: Backtracking Meta-Coarsened Explanations Onto Assembly Flow Graphs With Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14511</link><description>arXiv:2601.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As malware continues to become increasingly sophisticated, threatening, and evasive, malware detection systems must keep pace and become equally intelligent, powerful, and transparent. In this paper, we propose Assembly Flow Graph (AFG) to comprehensively represent the assembly flow of a binary executable as graph data. Importantly, AFG can be used to extract granular explanations needed to increase transparency for malware detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, since AFGs may be large in practice, we also propose a Meta-Coarsening approach to improve computational tractability via graph reduction. To evaluate our proposed approach we consider several novel and existing metrics to quantify the granularity and quality of explanations. Lastly, we also consider several hyperparameters in our proposed Meta-Coarsening approach that can be used to control the final explanation size. We evaluate our proposed approach using the CIC-DGG-2025 dataset. Our results indicate that our proposed AFG and Meta-Coarsening approach can provide both increased explainability and inference performance at certain coarsening levels. However, most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider granular explainability in malware detection using GNNs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14511v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aiming for AI Interoperability: Challenges and Opportunities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14512</link><description>arXiv:2601.14512v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Probabilistic mental simulation is thought to play a key role in human reasoning, planning, and prediction, yet the demands of simulation in complex environments exceed realistic human capacity limits. A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a "Just-in-Time" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14514v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning PDE Solvers with Physics and Data: A Unifying View of Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Neural Operators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14517</link><description>arXiv:2601.14517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to scientific modeling. Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14517v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Business Logic-Driven Text-to-SQL Data Synthesis for Business Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14518</link><description>arXiv:2601.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating Text-to-SQL agents in private business intelligence (BI) settings is challenging due to the scarcity of realistic, domain-specific data. While synthetic evaluation data offers a scalable solution, existing generation methods fail to capture business realism--whether questions reflect realistic business logic and workflows. We propose a Business Logic-Driven Data Synthesis framework that generates data grounded in business personas, work scenarios, and workflows. In addition, we improve the data quality by imposing a business reasoning complexity control strategy that diversifies the analytical reasoning steps required to answer the questions. Experiments on a production-scale Salesforce database show that our synthesized data achieves high business realism (98.44%), substantially outperforming OmniSQL (+19.5%) and SQL-Factory (+54.7%), while maintaining strong question-SQL alignment (98.59%). Our synthetic data also reveals that state-of-the-art Text-to-SQL models still have significant performance gaps, achieving only 42.86% execution accuracy on the most complex business queries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14518v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Worst-Case Are Adversarial Attacks?

Abstract: Adversarial attacks are widely used to evaluate model robustness, yet their validity as proxies for robustness to random perturbations remains debated. We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic metric that quantifies noisy risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor $\kappa$ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial direction. Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark widely used attacks, highlighting when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14519v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Runway Cascade of Transformers for Language Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14522</link><description>arXiv:2601.14522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In decoder-only (causal) transformers, the computation graph created by causal masking routes information through both direct-path attention and indirect paths formed by intermediate tokens. We denote these indirect paths between token pairs as their runways. We argue that certain failure modes of causal transformers as observed by a growing body of recent works are likely exacerbated by a misalignment between these two information propagation modes. We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation. Our proposed methodology introduces no additional parameters and can seamlessly be integrated into standard attention mechanism. Empirically, our rewired transformer results in steady improvements in general language modeling as well as noticeably stronger information retrieval and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14522v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Model-Powered Evolutionary Code Optimization on a Phylogenetic Tree</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14523</link><description>arXiv:2601.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing scientific computing algorithms for modern GPUs is a labor-intensive and iterative process involving repeated code modification, benchmarking, and tuning across complex hardware and software stacks. Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

Abstract: Automated AI research holds great potential to accelerate scientific discovery. However, current LLMs often generate plausible-looking but ineffective ideas. Execution grounding may help, but it is unclear whether automated execution is feasible and whether LLMs can learn from the execution feedback. To investigate these, we first build an automated executor to implement ideas and launch large-scale parallel GPU experiments to verify their effectiveness. We then convert two realistic research problems - LLM pre-training and post-training - into execution environments and demonstrate that our automated executor can implement a large fraction of the ideas sampled from frontier LLMs. We analyze two methods to learn from the execution feedback: evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Execution-guided evolutionary search is sample-efficient: it finds a method that significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline (69.4% vs 48.0%) on post-training, and finds a pre-training recipe that outperforms the nanoGPT baseline (19.7 minutes vs 35.9 minutes) on pre-training, all within just ten search epochs. Frontier LLMs often generate meaningful algorithmic ideas during search, but they tend to saturate early and only occasionally exhibit scaling trends. Reinforcement learning from execution reward, on the other hand, suffers from mode collapse. It successfully improves the average reward of the ideator model but not the upper-bound, due to models converging on simple ideas. We thoroughly analyze the executed ideas and training dynamics to facilitate future efforts towards execution-grounded automated AI research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14525v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM Security and Safety: Insights from Homotopy-Inspired Prompt Obfuscation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14528</link><description>arXiv:2601.14528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a homotopy-inspired prompt obfuscation framework to enhance understanding of security and safety vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). By systematically applying carefully engineered prompts, we demonstrate how latent model behaviors can be influenced in unexpected ways.

Abstract: Joint feature modeling in both the spatial and frequency domains has become a mainstream approach in MRI reconstruction. However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14530v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Search over Self-Edit Strategies for LLM Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14532</link><description>arXiv:2601.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many LLM-based open-ended search systems freeze the foundation model that proposes improvements to existing solutions, which may bottleneck long-run progress. Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker "Implications" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed "Implications" and approached the strongest human-designed "Rewrite" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

Abstract: The United States labor market exhibits a persistent coexistence of high job vacancy rates and prolonged unemployment duration, a pattern that standard labor market theory struggles to explain. This paper argues that a non-trivial portion of contemporary frictional unemployment is artificially induced by automated recruitment systems that rely on deterministic keyword-based screening.
  Drawing on labor economics, information asymmetry theory, and prior work on algorithmic hiring, we formalize this phenomenon as artificial frictional unemployment arising from semantic misinterpretation of candidate competencies. We evaluate this claim using controlled simulations that compare legacy keyword-based screening with semantic matching based on high-dimensional vector representations of resumes and job descriptions.
  The results demonstrate substantial improvements in recall and overall matching efficiency without a corresponding loss in precision. Building on these findings, the paper proposes a candidate-side workforce operating architecture that standardizes, verifies, and semantically aligns human capital signals while remaining interoperable with existing recruitment infrastructure. The findings highlight the economic costs of outdated hiring systems and the potential gains from improving semantic alignment in labor market matching.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14534v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] engGNN: A Dual-Graph Neural Network for Omics-Based Disease Classification and Feature Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14536</link><description>arXiv:2601.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omics data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, provide critical insights into disease mechanisms and clinical outcomes. However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14536v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Report for NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14541</link><description>arXiv:2601.14541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report distills the discussions and recommendations from the NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation (EDA), held on December 10, 2024 in Vancouver alongside NeurIPS 2024. Bringing together experts across machine learning and EDA, the workshop examined how AI-spanning large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), neurosymbolic methods, etc.-can facilitate EDA and shorten design turnaround. The workshop includes four themes: (1) AI for physical synthesis and design for manufacturing (DFM), discussing challenges in physical manufacturing process and potential AI applications; (2) AI for high-level and logic-level synthesis (HLS/LLS), covering pragma insertion, program transformation, RTL code generation, etc.; (3) AI toolbox for optimization and design, discussing frontier AI developments that could potentially be applied to EDA tasks; and (4) AI for test and verification, including LLM-assisted verification tools, ML-augmented SAT solving, security/reliability challenges, etc. The report recommends NSF to foster AI/EDA collaboration, invest in foundational AI for EDA, develop robust data infrastructures, promote scalable compute infrastructure, and invest in workforce development to democratize hardware design and enable next-generation hardware systems.

Abstract: The Shapley value provides a principled framework for fairly distributing rewards among participants according to their individual contributions. While prior work has applied this concept to data valuation in machine learning, existing formulations overwhelmingly assume that each participant contributes a fixed, deterministic dataset. In practice, however, data owners often provide samples drawn from underlying probabilistic distributions, introducing stochasticity into their marginal contributions and rendering the Shapley value itself a random variable. This work addresses this gap by proposing a framework for the Shapley value of probabilistic data distributions that quantifies both the expected contribution and the variance of each participant, thereby capturing uncertainty induced by random sampling. We develop theoretical and empirical methodologies for estimating these quantities: on the theoretical side, we derive unbiased estimators for the expectation and variance of the probabilistic Shapley value and analyze their statistical properties; on the empirical side, we introduce three Monte Carlo-based estimation algorithms - a baseline estimator using independent samples, a pooled estimator that improves efficiency through sample reuse, and a stratified pooled estimator that adaptively allocates sampling budget based on player-specific variability. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that these methods achieve strong accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, with the stratified pooled approach attaining substantial variance reduction at minimal additional cost. By extending Shapley value analysis from deterministic datasets to probabilistic data distributions, this work provides both theoretical rigor and practical tools for fair and reliable data valuation in modern stochastic data-sharing environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14543v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AI Agents vs. Human Investigators: Balancing Automation, Security, and Expertise in Cyber Forensic Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14544</link><description>arXiv:2601.14544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where cyber threats are rapidly evolving, the reliability of cyber forensic analysis has become increasingly critical for effective digital investigations and cybersecurity responses. AI agents are being adopted across digital forensic practices due to their ability to automate processes such as anomaly detection, evidence classification, and behavioral pattern recognition, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing investigation timelines. However, the characteristics that make AI indispensable also introduce notable risks. AI systems, often trained on biased or incomplete datasets, can produce misleading results, including false positives and false negatives, thereby jeopardizing the integrity of forensic investigations. This study presents a meticulous comparative analysis of the effectiveness of the most used AI agent, ChatGPT, and human forensic investigators in the realm of cyber forensic analysis. Our research reveals critical limitations within AI-driven approaches, demonstrating scenarios in which sophisticated or novel cyber threats remain undetected due to the rigid pattern-based nature of AI systems. Conversely, our analysis highlights the crucial role that human forensic investigators play in mitigating these risks. Through adaptive decision-making, ethical reasoning, and contextual understanding, human investigators effectively identify subtle anomalies and threats that may evade automated detection systems. To reinforce our findings, we conducted comprehensive reliability testing of forensic techniques using multiple cyber threat scenarios. These tests confirmed that while AI agents significantly improve the efficiency of routine analyses, human oversight remains crucial in ensuring accuracy and comprehensiveness of the results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Retrieval Utility and Answer Quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14546</link><description>arXiv:2601.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of answers generated by large language models (LLMs) in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is largely influenced by the contextual information contained in the retrieved documents. A key challenge for improving RAG is to predict both the utility of retrieved documents -- quantified as the performance gain from using context over generation without context -- and the quality of the final answers in terms of correctness and relevance. In this paper, we define two prediction tasks within RAG. The first is retrieval performance prediction (RPP), which estimates the utility of retrieved documents. The second is generation performance prediction (GPP), which estimates the final answer quality. We hypothesise that in RAG, the topical relevance of retrieved documents correlates with their utility, suggesting that query performance prediction (QPP) approaches can be adapted for RPP and GPP. Beyond these retriever-centric signals, we argue that reader-centric features, such as the LLM's perplexity of the retrieved context conditioned on the input query, can further enhance prediction accuracy for both RPP and GPP. Finally, we propose that features reflecting query-agnostic document quality and readability can also provide useful signals to the predictions. We train linear regression models with the above categories of predictors for both RPP and GPP. Experiments on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset show that combining predictors from multiple feature categories yields the most accurate estimates of RAG performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14546v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QMC: Efficient SLM Edge Inference via Outlier-Aware Quantization and Emergent Memories Co-Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14549</link><description>arXiv:2601.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge platforms is critical for real-time, privacy-sensitive generative AI, yet constrained by memory, latency, and energy budgets. Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14549v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TacUMI: A Multi-Modal Universal Manipulation Interface for Contact-Rich Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14550</link><description>arXiv:2601.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task decomposition is critical for understanding and learning complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Especially for tasks involving rich physical interactions, relying solely on visual observations and robot proprioceptive information often fails to reveal the underlying event transitions. This raises the requirement for efficient collection of high-quality multi-modal data as well as robust segmentation method to decompose demonstrations into meaningful modules. Building on the idea of the handheld demonstration device Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI), we introduce TacUMI, a multi-modal data collection system that integrates additionally ViTac sensors, force-torque sensor, and pose tracker into a compact, robot-compatible gripper design, which enables synchronized acquisition of all these modalities during human demonstrations. We then propose a multi-modal segmentation framework that leverages temporal models to detect semantically meaningful event boundaries in sequential manipulations. Evaluation on a challenging cable mounting task shows more than 90 percent segmentation accuracy and highlights a remarkable improvement with more modalities, which validates that TacUMI establishes a practical foundation for both scalable collection and segmentation of multi-modal demonstrations in contact-rich tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14550v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Blinding and Counterfactual Self-Simulation Mitigate Biases and Sycophancy in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14553</link><description>arXiv:2601.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fair decisions require ignoring irrelevant, potentially biasing, information. To achieve this, decision-makers need to approximate what decision they would have made had they not known certain facts, such as the gender or race of a job candidate. This counterfactual self-simulation is notoriously hard for humans, leading to biased judgments even by well-meaning actors. Here we show that large language models (LLMs) suffer from similar limitations in their ability to approximate what decisions they would make under counterfactual knowledge in offsetting gender and race biases and overcoming sycophancy. We show that prompting models to ignore or pretend not to know biasing information fails to offset these biases and occasionally backfires. However, unlike humans, LLMs can be given access to a ground-truth model of their own counterfactual cognition -- their own API. We show that this access to the responses of a blinded replica enables fairer decisions, while providing greater transparency to distinguish implicit from intentionally biased behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14553v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WebAssembly Based Portable and Secure Sensor Interface for Internet of Things</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14555</link><description>arXiv:2601.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the expansion of IoT connectivity continues to provide quality-of-life improvements around the world, they simultaneously introduce increasing privacy and security concerns. The lack of a clear definition in managing shared and protected access to IoT sensors offer channels by which devices can be compromised and sensitive data can be leaked. In recent years, WebAssembly has received considerable attention for its efficient application sandboxing suitable for embedded systems, making it a prime candidate for exploring a secure and portable sensor interface. This paper introduces the first WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) extension offering a secure, portable, and low-footprint sandbox enabling multi-tenant access to sensor data across heterogeneous embedded devices. The runtime extensions provide application memory isolation, ensure appropriate resource privileges by intercepting sensor access, and offer an MQTT-SN interface enabling in-network access control. When targeting the WebAssembly byte-code with the associated runtime extensions implemented atop the Zephyr RTOS, our evaluation of sensor access indicates a latency overhead of 6% with an additional memory footprint of 5% when compared to native execution. As MQTT-SN requests are dominated by network delays, the WASI-SN implementation of MQTT-SN introduces less than 1% additional latency with similar memory footprint.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14555v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constructing Multi-label Hierarchical Classification Models for MITRE ATT&amp;CK Text Tagging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14556</link><description>arXiv:2601.14556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK is a cybersecurity knowledge base that organizes threat actor and cyber-attack information into a set of tactics describing the reasons and goals threat actors have for carrying out attacks, with each tactic having a set of techniques that describe the potential methods used in these attacks. One major application of ATT&amp;amp;CK is the use of its tactic and technique hierarchy by security specialists as a framework for annotating cyber-threat intelligence reports, vulnerability descriptions, threat scenarios, inter alia, to facilitate downstream analyses. To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified "task space" characterization of the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches. Moreover, we show that GPT-4o model performance at the tactic level is significantly lower (roughly 60% accuracy) than our own approach. We also extend our baseline model to a corpus of threat scenarios for financial applications produced by subject matter experts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14556v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rewarding How Models Think Pedagogically: Integrating Pedagogical Reasoning and Thinking Rewards for LLMs in Education</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14560</link><description>arXiv:2601.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent tutoring systems, yet research on optimizing LLMs specifically for educational contexts remains limited. Recent works have proposed reinforcement learning approaches for training LLM tutors, but these methods focus solely on optimizing visible responses while neglecting the model's internal thinking process. We introduce PedagogicalRL-Thinking, a framework that extends pedagogical alignment to reasoning LLMs in education through two novel approaches: (1) Pedagogical Reasoning Prompting, which guides internal reasoning using domain-specific educational theory rather than generic instructions; and (2) Thinking Reward, which explicitly evaluates and reinforces the pedagogical quality of the model's reasoning traces. Our experiments reveal that domain-specific, theory-grounded prompting outperforms generic prompting, and that Thinking Reward is most effective when combined with pedagogical prompting. Furthermore, models trained only on mathematics tutoring dialogues show improved performance on educational benchmarks not seen during training, while preserving the base model's factual knowledge. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that pedagogical thinking reward produces systematic reasoning trace changes, with increased pedagogical reasoning and more structured instructional decision-making in the tutor's thinking process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14560v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scribble-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Dynamic Teacher Switching and Hierarchical Consistency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14563</link><description>arXiv:2601.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scribble-supervised methods have emerged to mitigate the prohibitive annotation burden in medical image segmentation. However, the inherent sparsity of these annotations introduces significant ambiguity, which results in noisy pseudo-label propagation and hinders the learning of robust anatomical boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose SDT-Net, a novel dual-teacher, single-student framework designed to maximize supervision quality from these weak signals. Our method features a Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select the most reliable teacher. This selected teacher then guides the student via two synergistic mechanisms: high-confidence pseudo-labels, refined by a Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism, and multi-level feature alignment, enforced by a Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module. Extensive experiments on the ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets demonstrate that SDT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14563v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SCSimulator: An Exploratory Visual Analytics Framework for Partner Selection in Supply Chains through LLM-driven Multi-Agent Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14566</link><description>arXiv:2601.14566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supply chains (SCs), complex networks spanning from raw material acquisition to product delivery, with enterprises as interconnected nodes, play a pivotal role in organizational success. However, optimizing SCs remains challenging, particularly in partner selection, a key bottleneck shaped by competitive and cooperative dynamics. This challenge constitutes a multi-objective dynamic game requiring a synergistic integration of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making and Game Theory. Traditional approaches, grounded in mathematical simplifications and managerial heuristics, fail to capture real-world intricacies and risk introducing subjective biases. Multi-agent simulation offers promise, but prior research has largely relied on fixed, uniform agent logic, limiting practical applicability. Recent advances in LLMs create opportunities to represent complex SC requirements and hybrid game logic. However, challenges persist in modeling dynamic SC relationships, ensuring interpretability, and balancing agent autonomy with expert control. We present SCSimulator, a visual analytics framework that integrates LLM-driven MAS with human-in-the-loop collaboration for SC partner selection. It simulates SC evolution via adaptive network structures and enterprise behaviors, which are visualized via interpretable interfaces. By combining CoT reasoning with XAI techniques, it generates multi-faceted, transparent explanations of decision trade-offs. Users can iteratively adjust simulation settings to explore outcomes aligned with their expectations and strategic priorities. Developed through iterative co-design with SC experts and industry managers, SCSimulator serves as a proof-of-concept, offering methodological contributions and practical insights for future research on SC decision-making and interactive AI-driven analytics. Usage scenarios and a user study demonstrate the system's effectiveness and usability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14566v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agent Identity URI Scheme: Topology-Independent Naming and Capability-Based Discovery for Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14567</link><description>arXiv:2601.14567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems face a fundamental architectural flaw: agent identity is bound to network location. When agents migrate between providers, scale across instances, or federate across organizations, URI-based identity schemes break references, fragment audit trails, and require centralized coordination. We propose the agent:// URI scheme, which decouples identity from topology through three orthogonal components: a trust root establishing organizational authority, a hierarchical capability path enabling semantic discovery, and a sortable unique identifier providing stable reference. The scheme enables capability-based discovery through DHT key derivation, where queries return agents by what they do rather than where they are. Trust-root scoping prevents cross-organization pollution while permitting federation when desired. Cryptographic attestation via PASETO tokens binds capability claims to agent identity, enabling verification without real-time contact with the issuing authority. We evaluate the scheme across four dimensions: capability expressiveness (100% coverage on 369 production tools with zero collision), discovery precision (F1=1.0 across 10,000 agents), identity stability (formal proofs of migration invariance), and performance (all operations under 5 microseconds). The agent:// URI scheme provides a formally-specified, practically-evaluated foundation for decentralized agent identity and capability-based discovery.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14567v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking the accuracy-resource dilemma: a lightweight adaptive video inference enhancement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14568</link><description>arXiv:2601.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing video inference (VI) enhancement methods typically aim to improve performance by scaling up model sizes and employing sophisticated network architectures. While these approaches demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, they often overlooked the trade-off of resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal inference performance. To address this problem, a fuzzy controller (FC-r) is developed based on key system parameters and inference-related metrics. Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged. Given the real-time resource conditions of the target device, the framework can dynamically switch between models of varying scales during VI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14568v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Social Caption: Evaluating Social Understanding in Multimodal Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14569</link><description>arXiv:2601.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social understanding abilities are crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interpret human social interactions. We introduce Social Caption, a framework grounded in interaction theory to evaluate social understanding abilities of MLLMs along three dimensions: Social Inference (SI), the ability to make accurate inferences about interactions; Holistic Social Analysis (HSA), the ability to generate comprehensive descriptions of interactions; Directed Social Analysis (DSA), the ability to extract relevant social information from interactions. We analyze factors influencing model performance in social understanding, such as scale, architectural design, and spoken context. Experiments with MLLM judges contribute insights about scaling automated evaluation of multimodal social understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14569v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Place with Intention: An Empirical Attendance Predictive Study of Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14570</link><description>arXiv:2601.14570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of daily attendance is vital for managing transportation, crowd flows, and services at large-scale international events such as Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan. However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module. Overall, our findings indicate that reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14570v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automatically Tightening Access Control Policies with Restricter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14582</link><description>arXiv:2601.14582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust access control is a cornerstone of secure software, systems, and networks. An access control mechanism is as effective as the policy it enforces. However, authoring effective policies that satisfy desired properties such as the principle of least privilege is a challenging task even for experienced administrators, as evidenced by many real instances of policy misconfiguration. In this paper, we set out to address this pain point by proposing Restricter, which automatically tightens each (permit) policy rule of a policy with respect to an access log, which captures some already exercised access requests and their corresponding access decisions (i.e., allow or deny). Restricter achieves policy tightening by reducing the number of access requests permitted by a policy rule without sacrificing the functionality of the underlying system it is regulating. We implement Restricter for Amazon's Cedar policy language and demonstrate its effectiveness through two realistic case studies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14582v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion for Brain MRI Progression Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14584</link><description>arXiv:2601.14584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling longitudinal brain MRI progression is crucial for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and predicting individualized structural changes. Existing state-of-the-art approaches, such as Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), often use multi-stage training pipelines with auxiliary conditioning modules but suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of conditional clinical covariates, and limited guarantees of anatomical consistency. We propose Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM), a segmentation-guided framework that enforces anatomically consistent progression while substantially simplifying the training pipeline. AG-LDM conditions latent diffusion by directly fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input level, a strategy that avoids auxiliary control networks by learning a unified, end-to-end model that represents both anatomy and progression. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion model training, ensuring consistent brain tissue boundaries and morphometric fidelity. Experiments on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and zero-shot evaluation on OASIS-3 demonstrate that AG-LDM matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20\% reduction in volumetric errors in generated images. AG-LDM also exhibits markedly stronger utilization of temporal and clinical covariates (up to 31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP) and generates biologically plausible counterfactual trajectories, accurately capturing hallmarks of Alzheimer's progression such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion. These results highlight AG-LDM as an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14584v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explainable OOHRI: Communicating Robot Capabilities and Limitations as Augmented Reality Affordances</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14587</link><description>arXiv:2601.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human interaction is essential for issuing personalized instructions and assisting robots when failure is likely.

To address this gap, we present explainable object-oriented HRI (X-OOHRI), an augmented reality (AR) interface that conveys robot action possibilities and constraints through visual signifiers, radial menus, color coding, and explanation tags. Our system encodes object properties and robot limits into object-oriented structures using a vision-language model, allowing explanation generation on the fly and direct manipulation of virtual twins spatially aligned within a simulated environment. We integrate the end-to-end pipeline with a physical robot and showcase diverse use cases ranging from low-level pick-and-place to high-level instructions. Finally, we evaluate X-OOHRI through a user study and find that participants effectively issue object-oriented commands, develop accurate mental models of robot limitations, and engage in mixed-initiative resolution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14587v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Designing KRIYA: An AI Companion for Wellbeing Self-Reflection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14589</link><description>arXiv:2601.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most personal wellbeing apps present summative dashboards of health and physical activity metrics, yet many users struggle to translate this information into meaningful understanding. These apps commonly support engagement through goals, reminders, and structured targets, which can reinforce comparison, judgment, and performance anxiety. To explore a complementary approach that prioritizes self-reflection, we design KRIYA, an AI wellbeing companion that supports co-interpretive engagement with personal wellbeing data. KRIYA aims to collaborate with users to explore questions, explanations, and future scenarios through features such as Comfort Zone, Detective Mode, and What-If Planning. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 college students interacting with a KRIYA prototype using hypothetical data. Our findings show that through KRIYA interaction, users framed engaging with wellbeing data as interpretation rather than performance, experienced reflection as supportive or pressuring depending on emotional framing, and developed trust through transparency. We discuss design implications for AI companions that support curiosity, self-compassion, and reflective sensemaking of personal health data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Counterfactual Modeling with Fine-Tuned LLMs for Health Intervention Design and Sensor Data Augmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14590</link><description>arXiv:2601.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) provide human-centric interpretability by identifying the minimal, actionable changes required to alter a machine learning model's prediction. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CF generation using large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot) and two open-source models-BioMistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, in both pretrained and fine-tuned configurations. Using the multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset, we assess CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly LLaMA-3.1-8B, produce CFs with high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and realistic, behaviorally modifiable feature adjustments. When used for data augmentation under controlled label-scarcity settings, LLM-generated CFs substantially restore classifier performance, yielding an average 20% F1 recovery across three scarcity scenarios. Compared with optimization-based baselines such as DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, LLMs offer a flexible, model-agnostic approach that generates more clinically actionable and semantically coherent counterfactuals. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of LLM-driven counterfactuals for both interpretable intervention design and data-efficient model training in sensor-based digital health.

Abstract: The requirement for expert annotations limits the effectiveness of deep learning for medical image analysis. Although 3D self-supervised methods like volume contrast learning (VoCo) are powerful and partially address the labeling scarcity issue, their high computational cost and memory consumption are barriers. We propose 2D-VoCo, an efficient adaptation of the VoCo framework for slice-level self-supervised pre-training that learns spatial-semantic features from unlabeled 2D CT slices via contrastive learning. The pre-trained CNN backbone is then integrated into a CNN-LSTM architecture to classify multi-organ injuries. In the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma dataset, 2D-VoCo pre-training significantly improves mAP, precision, recall, and RSNA score over training from scratch. Our framework provides a practical method to reduce the dependency on labeled data and enhance model performance in clinical CT analysis.

Abstract: Video captioning models convert frames into visual tokens and generate descriptions with large language models (LLMs). Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering. Overall, LFS provides an effective and easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14594v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IntelliSA: An Intelligent Static Analyzer for IaC Security Smell Detection Using Symbolic Rules and Neural Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14595</link><description>arXiv:2601.14595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables automated provisioning of large-scale cloud and on-premise environments, reducing the need for repetitive manual setup. However, this automation is a double-edged sword: a single misconfiguration in IaC scripts can propagate widely, leading to severe system downtime and security risks. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain security smells--bad coding patterns that may introduce vulnerabilities--and have proposed static analyzers based on symbolic rules to detect them. Yet, our preliminary analysis reveals that rule-based detection alone tends to over-approximate, producing excessive false positives and increasing the burden of manual inspection. In this paper, we present IntelliSA, an intelligent static analyzer for IaC security smell detection that integrates symbolic rules with neural inference. IntelliSA applies symbolic rules to over-approximate potential smells for broad coverage, then employs neural inference to filter false positives. While an LLM can effectively perform this filtering, reliance on LLM APIs introduces high cost and latency, raises data governance concerns, and limits reproducibility and offline deployment. To address the challenges, we adopt a knowledge distillation approach: an LLM teacher generates pseudo-labels to train a compact student model--over 500x smaller--that learns from the teacher's knowledge and efficiently classifies false positives. We evaluate IntelliSA against two static analyzers and three LLM baselines (Claude-4, Grok-4, and GPT-5) using a human-labeled dataset including 241 security smells across 11,814 lines of real-world IaC code. Experimental results show that IntelliSA achieves the highest F1 score (83%), outperforming baselines by 7-42%. Moreover, IntelliSA demonstrates the best cost-effectiveness, detecting 60% of security smells while inspecting less than 2% of the codebase.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14595v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimality of Staircase Mechanisms for Vector Queries under Differential Privacy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14597</link><description>arXiv:2601.14597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal design of additive mechanisms for vector-valued queries under $\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP). Given only the sensitivity of a query and a norm-monotone cost function measuring utility loss, we ask which noise distribution minimizes expected cost among all additive $\epsilon$-DP mechanisms. Using convex rearrangement theory, we show that this infinite-dimensional optimization problem admits a reduction to a one-dimensional compact and convex family of radially symmetric distributions whose extreme points are the staircase distributions. As a consequence, we prove that for any dimension, any norm, and any norm-monotone cost function, there exists an $\epsilon$-DP staircase mechanism that is optimal among all additive mechanisms. This result resolves a conjecture of Geng, Kairouz, Oh, and Viswanath, and provides a geometric explanation for the emergence of staircase mechanisms as extremal solutions in differential privacy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14597v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HELIOS: Hierarchical Graph Abstraction for Structure-Aware LLM Decompilation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14598</link><description>arXiv:2601.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to binary decompilation, yet they still treat code as plain text and ignore the graphs that govern program control flow. This limitation often yields syntactically fragile and logically inconsistent output, especially for optimized binaries. This paper presents \textsc{HELIOS}, a framework that reframes LLM-based decompilation as a structured reasoning task. \textsc{HELIOS} summarizes a binary's control flow and function calls into a hierarchical text representation that spells out basic blocks, their successors, and high-level patterns such as loops and conditionals. This representation is supplied to a general-purpose LLM, along with raw decompiler output, optionally combined with a compiler-in-the-loop that returns error messages when the generated code fails to build.
  On HumanEval-Decompile for \texttt{x86\_64}, \textsc{HELIOS} raises average object file compilability from 45.0\% to 85.2\% for Gemini~2.0 and from 71.4\% to 89.6\% for GPT-4.1~Mini. With compiler feedback, compilability exceeds 94\% and functional correctness improves by up to 5.6 percentage points over text-only prompting. Across six architectures drawn from x86, ARM, and MIPS, \textsc{HELIOS} reduces the spread in functional correctness while keeping syntactic correctness consistently high, all without fine-tuning. These properties make \textsc{HELIOS} a practical building block for reverse engineering workflows in security settings where analysts need recompilable, semantically faithful code across diverse hardware targets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14598v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs: A Multi-armed Bandit Learning Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14599</link><description>arXiv:2601.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large number of heuristics have been proposed to optimize the reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs. However, inconsistent claims are made from time to time, making this area elusive. Reflecting on this situation, two fundamental questions still lack a clear understanding: 1) what is the role of each optimizing choice? 2) which ones are the bottlenecks? This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings. The up procedure of the experiment pipeline expanding the minimalist configuration layer by layer, examining the role of each design choice. Experimental results on three LLMs and two reasoning datasets not only reveal new understanding of the design choice but also yield essential insights to shape the area.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14599v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Holmes: An Evidence-Grounded LLM Agent for Auditable DDoS Investigation in Cloud Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14601</link><description>arXiv:2601.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud environments face frequent DDoS threats due to centralized resources and broad attack surfaces. Modern cloud-native DDoS attacks further evolve rapidly and often blend multi-vector strategies, creating an operational dilemma: defenders need wire-speed monitoring while also requiring explainable, auditable attribution for response. Existing rule-based and supervised-learning approaches typically output black-box scores or labels, provide limited evidence chains, and generalize poorly to unseen attack variants; meanwhile, high-quality labeled data is often difficult to obtain in cloud settings.
  We present Holmes (DDoS Detective), an LLM-based DDoS detection agent that reframes the model as a virtual SRE investigator rather than an end-to-end classifier. Holmes couples a funnel-like hierarchical workflow (counters/sFlow for continuous sensing and triage; PCAP evidence collection triggered only on anomaly windows) with an Evidence Pack abstraction that converts binary packets into compact, reproducible, high-signal structured evidence. On top of this evidence interface, Holmes enforces a structure-first investigation protocol and strict JSON/quotation constraints to produce machine-consumable reports with auditable evidence anchors.
  We evaluate Holmes on CICDDoS2019 reflection/amplification attacks and script-triggered flooding scenarios. Results show that Holmes produces attribution decisions grounded in salient evidence anchors across diverse attack families, and when errors occur, its audit logs make the failure source easy to localize, demonstrating the practicality of an LLM agent for cost-controlled and traceable DDoS investigation in cloud operations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14601v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] 3D Space as a Scratchpad for Editable Text-to-Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14602</link><description>arXiv:2601.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown that reasoning improves when intermediate thoughts are externalized into explicit workspaces, such as chain-of-thought traces or tool-augmented reasoning. Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation. Our results highlight a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language, but also in space.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve competitive performance across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet pretraining is computationally demanding, making optimizer efficiency an important practical consideration. Muon accelerates LLM pretraining via orthogonal momentum updates that serve as a matrix analogue of the element-wise sign operator. Motivated by the recent perspective that Adam is a variance-adaptive sign update algorithm, we propose two variants of Muon, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS, which apply variance-adaptive normalization to momentum before orthogonalization. Muon-NSR applies noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) modulation, while Muon-VS performs variance-based scaling without introducing additional hyperparameters. Experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining demonstrate that our proposed methods accelerate convergence and consistently achieve lower validation loss than both competitive, well-tuned AdamW and Muon baselines. For example, on the LLaMA-1.2B model, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS reduce the iterations required to reach the target validation loss by $1.36\times$ relative to the well-tuned Muon following the recent benchmark.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14603v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] U-Harmony: Enhancing Joint Training for Segmentation Models with Universal Harmonization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14605</link><description>arXiv:2601.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clinical practice, medical segmentation datasets are often limited and heterogeneous, with variations in modalities, protocols, and anatomical targets across institutions. Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, often sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint training method called Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), which can be integrated into deep learning-based architectures with a domain-gated head, enabling a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously. By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. More appealingly, our framework also supports universal modality adaptation, allowing the seamless learning of new imaging modalities and anatomical classes. Extensive experiments on cross-institutional brain lesion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing a new benchmark for robust and adaptable 3D medical image segmentation models in real-world clinical settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14605v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An LLM Agent-based Framework for Whaling Countermeasures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14606</link><description>arXiv:2601.14606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the spread of generative AI in recent years, attacks known as Whaling have become a serious threat. Whaling is a form of social engineering that targets important high-authority individuals within organizations and uses sophisticated fraudulent emails. In the context of Japanese universities, faculty members frequently hold positions that combine research leadership with authority within institutional workflows. This structural characteristic leads to the wide public disclosure of high-value information such as publications, grants, and detailed researcher profiles. Such extensive information exposure enables the construction of highly precise target profiles using generative AI. This raises concerns that Whaling attacks based on high-precision profiling by generative AI will become prevalent. In this study, we propose a Whaling countermeasure framework for university faculty members that constructs personalized defense profiles and uses large language model (LLM)-based agents. We design agents that (i) build vulnerability profiles for each target from publicly available information on faculty members, (ii) identify potential risk scenarios relevant to Whaling defense based on those profiles, (iii) construct defense profiles corresponding to the vulnerabilities and anticipated risks, and (iv) analyze Whaling emails using the defense profiles. Furthermore, we conduct a preliminary risk-assessment experiment. The results indicate that the proposed method can produce judgments accompanied by explanations of response policies that are consistent with the work context of faculty members who are Whaling targets. The findings also highlight practical challenges and considerations for future operational deployment and systematic evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14606v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Performance-Productivity Trade-offs in AMT Runtimes: A Task Bench Study of Itoyori, ItoyoriFBC, HPX, and MPI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14608</link><description>arXiv:2601.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) runtimes offer a productive alternative to the Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, the diverse AMT landscape makes fair comparisons challenging. Task Bench, proposed by Slaughter et al., addresses this challenge through a parameterized framework for evaluating parallel programming systems. This work integrates two recent cluster AMTs, Itoyori and ItoyoriFBC, into Task Bench for comprehensive evaluation against MPI and HPX. Itoyori employs a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model with RDMA-based work stealing, while ItoyoriFBC extends it with futurebased synchronization.
  We evaluate these systems in terms of both performance and programmer productivity. Performance is assessed across various configurations, including compute-bound kernels, weak scaling, and both imbalanced and communication-intensive patterns. Performance is quantified using application efficiency, i.e., the percentage of maximum performance achieved, and the Minimum Effective Task Granularity (METG), i.e., the smallest task duration before runtime overheads dominate. Programmer productivity is quantified using Lines of Code (LOC) and the Number of Library Constructs (NLC).
  Our results reveal distinct trade-offs. MPI achieves the highest efficiency for regular, communication-light workloads but requires verbose, lowlevel code. HPX maintains stable efficiency under load imbalance across varying node counts, yet ranks last in productivity metrics, demonstrating that AMTs do not inherently guarantee improved productivity over MPI. Itoyori achieves the highest efficiency in communication-intensive configurations while leading in programmer productivity. ItoyoriFBC exhibits slightly lower efficiency than Itoyori, though its future-based synchronization offers potential for expressing irregular workloads.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14608v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Consistent Taxonomic Classification through Hierarchical Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14610</link><description>arXiv:2601.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often fail to grasp hierarchical knowledge. This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset. Notably, this significant gain was achieved by fine-tuning on just a small subset of data, without relying on any examples generated by other VLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14610v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Seeing to Think?

Abstract: Conversational AI systems increasingly function as primary interfaces for information seeking, yet how they present sources to support information evaluation remains under-explored. This paper investigates how source transparency design shapes interactive information seeking, trust, and critical engagement. We conducted a controlled between-subjects experiment (N=372) comparing four source presentation interfaces - Collapsible, Hover Card, Footer, and Aligned Sidebar - varying in visibility and accessibility. Using fine-grained behavioral analysis and automated critical thinking assessment, we found that interface design fundamentally alters exploration strategies and evidence integration. While the Hover Card interface facilitated seamless, on-demand verification during the task, the Aligned Sidebar uniquely mitigated the negative effects of information overload: as citation density increased, Sidebar users demonstrated significantly higher critical thinking and synthesis scores compared to other conditions. Our results highlight a trade-off between designs that support workflow fluency and those that enforce reflective verification, offering practical implications for designing adaptive and responsible conversational AI that fosters critical engagement with AI generated content.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14611v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Ion-Intercalation Memristor for Enabling Full Parallel Writing in Crossbar Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14613</link><description>arXiv:2601.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossbar architectures have long been seen as a promising foundation for in-memory computing, using memristor arrays for high-density, energy-efficient analog computation. However, this conventional architecture suffers from a fundamental limitation: the inability to perform parallel write operations due to the sneak path problem. This arises from the structural overlap of read and write paths, forcing sequential or semi-parallel updates and severely limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a new memristor design that decouples read and write operations at the device level. This design enables orthogonal conductive paths, and employs a reversible ion doping mechanism, inspired by lithium-ion battery principles, to modulate resistance states independently of computation. Fabricated devices exhibit near-ideal memristive characteristics and stable performance under isolated read/write conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14613v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Cybersecurity Superintelligence: from AI-guided humans to human-guided AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14614</link><description>arXiv:2601.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cybersecurity superintelligence -- artificial intelligence exceeding the best human capability in both speed and strategic reasoning -- represents the next frontier in security. This paper documents the emergence of such capability through three major contributions that have pioneered the field of AI Security. First, PentestGPT (2023) established LLM-guided penetration testing, achieving 228.6% improvement over baseline models through an architecture that externalizes security expertise into natural language guidance. Second, Cybersecurity AI (CAI, 2025) demonstrated automated expert-level performance, operating 3,600x faster than humans while reducing costs 156-fold, validated through #1 rankings at international competitions including the $50,000 Neurogrid CTF prize. Third, Generative Cut-the-Rope (G-CTR, 2026) introduces a neurosymbolic architecture embedding game-theoretic reasoning into LLM-based agents: symbolic equilibrium computation augments neural inference, doubling success rates while reducing behavioral variance 5.2x and achieving 2:1 advantage over non-strategic AI in Attack &amp; Defense scenarios.
  Together, these advances establish a clear progression from AI-guided humans to human-guided game-theoretic cybersecurity superintelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14614v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SearchGym: Bootstrapping Real-World Search Agents via Cost-Effective and High-Fidelity Environment Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14615</link><description>arXiv:2601.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search agents have emerged as a pivotal paradigm for solving open-ended, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, training these agents via Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces a critical dilemma: interacting with live commercial Web APIs is prohibitively expensive, while relying on static data snapshots often introduces noise due to data misalignment. This misalignment generates corrupted reward signals that destabilize training by penalizing correct reasoning or rewarding hallucination. To address this, we propose SearchGym, a simulation environment designed to bootstrap robust search agents. SearchGym employs a rigorous generative pipeline to construct a verifiable knowledge graph and an aligned document corpus, ensuring that every reasoning task is factually grounded and strictly solvable. Building on this controllable environment, we introduce SearchGym-RL, a curriculum learning methodology that progressively optimizes agent policies through purified feedback, evolving from basic interactions to complex, long-horizon planning. Extensive experiments across the Llama and Qwen families demonstrate strong Sim-to-Real generalization. Notably, our Qwen2.5-7B-Base model trained within SearchGym surpasses the web-enhanced ASearcher baseline across nine diverse benchmarks by an average relative margin of 10.6%. Our results validate that high-fidelity simulation serves as a scalable and highly cost-effective methodology for developing capable search agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14615v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Maximum Edge-based Quasi-Clique: Novel Iterative Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14619</link><description>arXiv:2601.14619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting cohesive subgraphs from complex networks is a fundamental task in graph analytics and is essential for understanding biological, social, and web graphs. The edge-based $\gamma$-quasi-clique model offers a flexible alternative by identifying subgraphs whose edge densities exceed a specified threshold $\gamma$. However, finding the exact maximum edge-based quasi-clique is computationally challenging, as the problem is NP-hard and lacks the hereditary property. These characteristics limit the effectiveness of conventional pruning methods and the development of efficient reduction rules. As a result, existing algorithms, such as QClique and FPCE, struggle to scale to large graphs. In this paper, we revisit the problem and propose a novel iterative framework that reformulates the problem as a sequence of hereditary subproblems, enabling more effective pruning and reduction strategies and improving the worst-case time complexity. Furthermore, we redesign the iterative process and introduce a novel heuristic to further improve practical efficiency. Extensive experiments on 253 large-scale real-world graphs demonstrate that our proposed algorithm EQC-Pro outperforms existing methods by up to four orders of magnitude.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14619v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Probing Prompt Design for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation with Vision Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14622</link><description>arXiv:2601.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models are increasingly used for social robot navigation, yet existing benchmarks largely overlook principled prompt design for socially compliant behavior. This limitation is particularly relevant in practice, as many systems rely on small vision language models (VLMs) for efficiency. Compared to large language models, small VLMs exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities, making effective prompt design critical for accurate navigation. Inspired by cognitive theories of human learning and motivation, we study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing, where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves. Experiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets reveal three key findings. First, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans achieves the best performance, while competition against other AI systems performs worst. For finetuned models, competition against the model's past self yields the strongest results, followed by competition against humans, with performance further influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics. Second, inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance, even compared to direct finetuning. Third, while direct finetuning substantially improves semantic-level metrics such as perception, prediction, and reasoning, it yields limited gains in action accuracy. In contrast, our system prompts produce a disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy, indicating that the proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14622v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Break-Resilient Codes with Loss Tolerance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14623</link><description>arXiv:2601.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging applications in manufacturing, wireless communication, and molecular data storage require robust coding schemes that remain effective under physical distortions where codewords may be arbitrarily fragmented and partially missing. To address such challenges, we propose a new family of error-correcting codes, termed $(t,s)$-break-resilient codes ($(t,s)$-BRCs). A $(t,s)$-BRC guarantees correct decoding of the original message even after up to~$t$ arbitrary breaks of the codeword and the complete loss of some fragments whose total length is at most~$s$. This model unifies and generalizes previous approaches, extending break-resilient codes (which handle arbitrary fragmentation without fragment loss) and deletion codes (which correct bit losses in unknown positions without fragmentation) into a single information-theoretic framework. We develop a theoretical foundation for $(t,s)$-BRCs, including a formal adversarial channel model, lower bounds on the necessary redundancy, and explicit code constructions that approach these bounds.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14623v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14625</link><description>arXiv:2601.14625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of diffusion models highlights the growing need for detecting generated images. Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14625v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Brain-inspired Embodied Intelligence for Fluid and Fast Reflexive Robotics Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14628</link><description>arXiv:2601.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in embodied intelligence have leveraged massive scaling of data and model parameters to master natural-language command following and multi-task control. In contrast, biological systems demonstrate an innate ability to acquire skills rapidly from sparse experience. Crucially, current robotic policies struggle to replicate the dynamic stability, reflexive responsiveness, and temporal memory inherent in biological motion. Here we present Neuromorphic Vision-Language-Action (NeuroVLA), a framework that mimics the structural organization of the bio-nervous system between the cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord. We adopt a system-level bio-inspired design: a high-level model plans goals, an adaptive cerebellum module stabilizes motion using high-frequency sensors feedback, and a bio-inspired spinal layer executes lightning-fast actions generation. NeuroVLA represents the first deployment of a neuromorphic VLA on physical robotics, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We observe the emergence of biological motor characteristics without additional data or special guidance: it stops the shaking in robotic arms, saves significant energy(only 0.4w on Neuromorphic Processor), shows temporal memory ability and triggers safety reflexes in less than 20 milliseconds.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14628v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Relational Graph Modeling for Credit Default Prediction: Heterogeneous GNNs and Hybrid Ensemble Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14633</link><description>arXiv:2601.14633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit default risk arises from complex interactions among borrowers, financial institutions, and transaction-level behaviors. While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories.
  We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Finally, we conduct structured explainability and fairness analyses to characterize how relational signals affect subgroup behavior and screening-oriented outcomes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14633v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Forest-Chat: Adapting Vision-Language Agents for Interactive Forest Change Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14637</link><description>arXiv:2601.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, together with advances in deep learning, creates new opportunities for enhancing forest monitoring workflows. Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14637v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DesignBridge: Bridging Designer Expertise and User Preferences through AI-Enhanced Co-Design for Fashion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14639</link><description>arXiv:2601.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective collaboration between designers and users is important for fashion design, which can increase the user acceptance of fashion products and thereby create value. However, it remains an enduring challenge, as traditional designer-centric approaches restrict meaningful user participation, while user-driven methods demand design proficiency, often marginalizing professional creative judgment. Current co-design practices, including workshops and AI-assisted frameworks, struggle with low user engagement, inefficient preference collection, and difficulties in balancing user feedback with design considerations. To address these challenges, we conducted a formative study with designers and users experienced in co-design (N=7), identifying critical challenges for current collaboration between designers and users in the co-design process, and their requirements. Informed by these insights, we introduce DesignBridge, a multi-platform AI-enhanced interactive system that bridges designer expertise and user preferences through three stages: (1) Initial Design Framing, where designers define initial concepts. (2) Preference Expression Collection, where users intuitively articulate preferences via interactive tools. (3) Preference-Integrated Design, where designers use AI-assisted analytics to integrate feedback into cohesive designs. A user study demonstrates that DesignBridge significantly enhances user preference collection and analysis, enabling designers to integrate diverse preferences with professional expertise.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14639v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MIND: Empowering Mental Health Clinicians with Multimodal Data Insights through a Narrative Dashboard</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14641</link><description>arXiv:2601.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in data collection enable the capture of rich patient-generated data: from passive sensing (e.g., wearables and smartphones) to active self-reports (e.g., cross-sectional surveys and ecological momentary assessments). Although prior research has demonstrated the utility of patient-generated data in mental healthcare, significant challenges remain in effectively presenting these data streams along with clinical data (e.g., clinical notes) for clinical decision-making. Through co-design sessions with five clinicians, we propose MIND, a large language model-powered dashboard designed to present clinically relevant multimodal data insights for mental healthcare. MIND presents multimodal insights through narrative text, complemented by charts communicating underlying data. Our user study (N=16) demonstrates that clinicians perceive MIND as a significant improvement over baseline methods, reporting improved performance to reveal hidden and clinically relevant data insights (p&lt;.001) and support their decision-making (p=.004). Grounded in the study results, we discuss future research opportunities to integrate data narratives in broader clinical practices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14641v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Input-to-State Stabilizing Neural Controllers for Unknown Switched Nonlinear Systems within Compact Sets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14643</link><description>arXiv:2601.14643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a neural network based control framework that ensures system safety and input-to-state stability (ISS) for general nonlinear switched systems with unknown dynamics. Leveraging the concept of dwell time, we derive Lyapunov based sufficient conditions under which both safety and ISS of the closed-loop switched system are guaranteed. The feedback controllers and the associated Lyapunov functions are parameterized using neural networks and trained from data collected over a compact state space via deterministic sampling. To provide formal stability guarantees under the learned controllers, we introduce a validity condition based on Lipschitz continuity assumptions, which is embedded directly into the training framework. This ensures that the resulting neural network controllers satisfy provable correctness and stability guarantees beyond the sampled data. As a special case, the proposed framework recovers ISS and safety under arbitrary switching when a common Lyapunov function exists. Simulation results on a representative switched nonlinear system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14643v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Spatially Generalizable Mobile Manipulation via Adaptive Experience Selection and Dynamic Imagination</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14649</link><description>arXiv:2601.14649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Manipulation (MM) involves long-horizon decision-making over multi-stage compositions of heterogeneous skills, such as navigation and picking up objects. Despite recent progress, existing MM methods still face two key limitations: (i) low sample efficiency, due to ineffective use of redundant data generated during long-term MM interactions; and (ii) poor spatial generalization, as policies trained on specific tasks struggle to transfer to new spatial layouts without additional training. In this paper, we address these challenges through Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination. In particular, AES makes MM agents pay more attention to critical experience fragments in long trajectories that affect task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Based on AES, a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is introduced for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) by capturing the coupled dynamics between the mobile base and the manipulator and imagining the dynamics of future manipulations. RSSM-based MPFP can reinforce MM skill learning on the current task while enabling effective generalization to new spatial layouts. Comparative studies across different experimental configurations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MM policies. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of our method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14649v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] READ-Net: Clarifying Emotional Ambiguity via Adaptive Feature Recalibration for Audio-Visual Depression Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14651</link><description>arXiv:2601.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression is a severe global mental health issue that impairs daily functioning and overall quality of life. Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\% in accuracy and 1.26\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14651v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MAS-Orchestra: Understanding and Improving Multi-Agent Reasoning Through Holistic Orchestration and Controlled Benchmarks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14652</link><description>arXiv:2601.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While multi-agent systems (MAS) promise elevated intelligence through coordination of agents, current approaches to automatic MAS design under-deliver. Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14652v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Say Anything but This: When Tokenizer Betrays Reasoning in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14658</link><description>arXiv:2601.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) reason over discrete token ID sequences, yet modern subword tokenizers routinely produce non-unique encodings: multiple token ID sequences can detokenize to identical surface strings. This representational mismatch creates an unmeasured fragility wherein reasoning processes can fail. LLMs may treat two internal representations as distinct "words" even when they are semantically identical at the text level. In this work, we show that tokenization can betray LLM reasoning through one-to-many token ID mappings. We introduce a tokenization-consistency probe that requires models to replace designated target words in context while leaving all other content unchanged. The task is intentionally simple at the surface level, enabling us to attribute failures to tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts rather than to knowledge gaps or parameter limitations. Through analysis of over 11000 replacement trials across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, we find a non-trivial rate of outputs exhibit phantom edits: cases where models operate under the illusion of correct reasoning, a phenomenon arising from tokenizer-induced representational defects. We further analyze these cases and provide a taxonomy of eight systematic tokenizer artifacts, including whitespace-boundary shifts and intra-word resegmentation. These findings indicate that part of apparent reasoning deficiency originates in the tokenizer layer, motivating tokenizer-level remedies before incurring the cost of training ever-larger models on ever-larger corpora.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14658v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NeuroFilter: Privacy Guardrails for Conversational LLM Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14660</link><description>arXiv:2601.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the computational challenge of enforcing privacy for agentic Large Language Models (LLMs), where privacy is governed by the contextual integrity framework. Indeed, existing defenses rely on LLM-mediated checking stages that add substantial latency and cost, and that can be undermined in multi-turn interactions through manipulation or benign-looking conversational scaffolding. Contrasting this background, this paper makes a key observation: internal representations associated with privacy-violating intent can be separated from benign requests using linear structure. Using this insight, the paper proposes NeuroFilter, a guardrail framework that operationalizes contextual integrity by mapping norm violations to simple directions in the model's activation space, enabling detection even when semantic filters are bypassed. The proposed filter is also extended to capture threats arising during long conversations using the concept of activation velocity, which measures cumulative drift in internal representations across turns. A comprehensive evaluation across over 150,000 interactions and covering models from 7B to 70B parameters, illustrates the strong performance of NeuroFilter in detecting privacy attacks while maintaining zero false positives on benign prompts, all while reducing the computational inference cost by several orders of magnitude when compared to LLM-based agentic privacy defenses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14660v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Query-Efficient Agentic Graph Extraction Attacks on GraphRAG Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14662</link><description>arXiv:2601.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) systems construct knowledge graphs over document collections to support multi-hop reasoning. While prior work shows that GraphRAG responses may leak retrieved subgraphs, the feasibility of query-efficient reconstruction of the hidden graph structure remains unexplored under realistic query budgets. We study a budget-constrained black-box setting where an adversary adaptively queries the system to steal its latent entity-relation graph. We propose AGEA (Agentic Graph Extraction Attack), a framework that leverages a novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, external graph memory modules, and a two-stage graph extraction pipeline combining lightweight discovery with LLM-based filtering. We evaluate AGEA on medical, agriculture, and literary datasets across Microsoft-GraphRAG and LightRAG systems. Under identical query budgets, AGEA significantly outperforms prior attack baselines, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships while maintaining high precision. These results demonstrate that modern GraphRAG systems are highly vulnerable to structured, agentic extraction attacks, even under strict query limits.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14662v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Calibrated uncertainty quantification for prosumer flexibility aggregation in ancillary service markets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14663</link><description>arXiv:2601.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable forecasting of prosumer flexibility is critical for demand response aggregators participating in frequency controlled ancillary services market, where strict reliability requirements such as the P90 standard are enforced. Limited historical data, dependence on exogeneous factors, and heterogenous prosumer behaviour introduce significant epistemic uncertainty, making deterministic or poorly calibrated probabilistic models unsuitable for market bidding. This paper proposes the use of scalable uncertainty quantification framework that integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) with conformal prediction (CP) to produce calibrated, finite sample prediction intervals for aggregated prosumer flexibility. The proposed framework is applied to a behind-the-meter aggregator participating in the Danish manual frequency restoration reserve capacity market. A large-scale synthetic dataset is generated using a modified industry-grade home energy management system, combined with publicly available load, solar, price, activation and device-level data. The resulting machine learning surrogate model captures aggregate prosumer price responsiveness and provides uncertainty-aware estimates suitable for market bidding. Multiple multivariate CP strategies are evaluated and benchmarked against conventional MCD-based methods. Results show that standalone MCD systematically overestimates available flexibility and violates P90 compliance, whereas the proposed MCD-CP framework achieves reliable coverage with controlled conservatism. When embedded in aggregator bidding model, conformalised methods substantially reduce overbidding risk and achieve upto 70% of perfect-information profit while satisfying regulatory reliability constraints, providing practical, computationally efficient, and market-compliant solution for aggregator flexibility forecasting under uncertainty.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14663v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Two-Stage Risk-Averse DRO-MILP Methodological Framework for Managing AI/Data Center Demand Shocks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14665</link><description>arXiv:2601.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data centers is reshaping electricity demand patterns. This is achieved by introducing fast, multi-gigawatt load ramps that challenge the stability and resilience of modern power systems. Traditional resilience frameworks focus mainly on physical outages and largely overlook these emerging digital-era disturbances. This paper proposes a unified two-stage, risk-aware distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-MILP framework that coordinates the pre-allocation and post-event dispatch of Flexible Capacity Modules (FCMs), including BESS, fast-ramping generation, demand response, and potential long-duration storage. Stage-I optimally positions FCMs using DRO with CVaR to hedge against uncertain AI load surges. Stage-II models real-time stabilization following stochastic demand-shock scenarios, minimizing imbalance, unserved energy, and restoration penalties. The framework is designed to be applied on IEEE 33-bus system or expanded for scalability to larger IEEE test feeders capable of representing AI-scale loads. This contributes a scalable planning tool for resilient, AI-integrated distribution grids.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14665v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] INFA-Guard: Mitigating Malicious Propagation via Infection-Aware Safeguarding in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14667</link><description>arXiv:2601.14667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, where malicious influence can propagate virally through inter-agent communication. Conventional safeguards often rely on a binary paradigm that strictly distinguishes between benign and attack agents, failing to account for infected agents i.e., benign entities converted by attack agents. In this paper, we propose Infection-Aware Guard, INFA-Guard, a novel defense framework that explicitly identifies and addresses infected agents as a distinct threat category. By leveraging infection-aware detection and topological constraints, INFA-Guard accurately localizes attack sources and infected ranges. During remediation, INFA-Guard replaces attackers and rehabilitates infected ones, avoiding malicious propagation while preserving topological integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that INFA-Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average of 33%, while exhibiting cross-model robustness, superior topological generalization, and high cost-effectiveness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14667v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mirai: Autoregressive Visual Generation Needs Foresight</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14671</link><description>arXiv:2601.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generators model images as sequences of discrete tokens and are trained with next token likelihood. This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning "future" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark. Our study highlights that visual autoregressive models need foresight.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14671v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GEGO: A Hybrid Golden Eagle and Genetic Optimization Algorithm for Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning in Resource-Constrained Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14672</link><description>arXiv:2601.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a critical yet computationally expensive step in training neural networks, particularly when the search space is high dimensional and nonconvex. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are often used for this purpose due to their derivative free nature and robustness against local optima. In this work, we propose Golden Eagle Genetic Optimization (GEGO), a hybrid metaheuristic that integrates the population movement strategy of Golden Eagle Optimization with the genetic operators of selection, crossover, and mutation.
  The main novelty of GEGO lies in embedding genetic operators directly into the iterative search process of GEO, rather than applying them as a separate evolutionary stage. This design improves population diversity during search and reduces premature convergence while preserving the exploration behavior of GEO.
  GEGO is evaluated on standard unimodal, multimodal, and composite benchmark functions from the CEC2017 suite, where it consistently outperforms its constituent algorithms and several classical metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and robustness. The algorithm is further applied to hyperparameter tuning of artificial neural networks on the MNIST dataset, where GEGO achieves improved classification accuracy and more stable convergence compared to GEO and GA. These results indicate that GEGO provides a balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoff and is well suited for hyperparameter optimization under constrained computational settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14672v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient reformulations of ReLU deep neural networks for surrogate modelling in power system optimisation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14673</link><description>arXiv:2601.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing decarbonisation of power systems is driving an increasing reliance on distributed energy resources, which introduces complex and nonlinear interactions that are difficult to capture in conventional optimisation models. As a result, machine learning based surrogate modelling has emerged as a promising approach, but integrating machine learning models such as ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) directly into optimisation often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable formulations. This paper proposes a linear programming (LP) reformulation for a class of convexified ReLU DNNs with non-negative weight matrices beyond the first layer, enabling a tight and tractable embedding of learned surrogate models in optimisation. We evaluate the method using a case study on learning the prosumer's responsiveness within an aggregator bidding problem in the Danish tertiary capacity market. The proposed reformulation is benchmarked against state-of-the-art alternatives, including piecewise linearisation (PWL), MIP-based embedding, and other LP relaxations. Across multiple neural network architectures and market scenarios, the convexified ReLU DNN achieves solution quality comparable to PWL and MIP-based reformulations while significantly improving computational performance and preserving model fidelity, unlike penalty-based reformulations. The results demonstrate that convexified ReLU DNNs offer a scalable and reliable methodology for integrating learned surrogate models in optimisation, with applicability to a wide range of emerging power system applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14673v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LaVR: Scene Latent Conditioned Generative Video Trajectory Re-Rendering using Large 4D Reconstruction Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14674</link><description>arXiv:2601.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a monocular video, the goal of video re-rendering is to generate views of the scene from a novel camera trajectory. Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.
  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

Abstract: Object detection in video and image surveillance is a well-established yet rapidly evolving task, strongly influenced by recent deep learning advancements. This review summarises modern techniques by examining architectural innovations, generative model integration, and the use of temporal information to enhance robustness and accuracy. Unlike earlier surveys, it classifies methods based on core architectures, data processing strategies, and surveillance specific challenges such as dynamic environments, occlusions, lighting variations, and real-time requirements. The primary goal is to evaluate the current effectiveness of semantic object detection, while secondary aims include analysing deep learning models and their practical applications. The review covers CNN-based detectors, GAN-assisted approaches, and temporal fusion methods, highlighting how generative models support tasks such as reconstructing missing frames, reducing occlusions, and normalising illumination. It also outlines preprocessing pipelines, feature extraction progress, benchmarking datasets, and comparative evaluations. Finally, emerging trends in low-latency, efficient, and spatiotemporal learning approaches are identified for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14677v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Transfer Learning from One Cancer to Another via Deep Learning Domain Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14678</link><description>arXiv:2601.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised deep learning models often achieve excellent performance within their training distribution but struggle to generalize beyond it. In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.
  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.
  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14678v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HCVR Scene Generation: High Compatibility Virtual Reality Environment Generation for Extended Redirected Walking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14679</link><description>arXiv:2601.14679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural walking enhances immersion in virtual environments (VEs), but physical space limitations and obstacles hinder exploration, especially in large virtual scenes. Redirected Walking (RDW) techniques mitigate this by subtly manipulating the virtual camera to guide users away from physical collisions within pre-defined VEs. However, RDW efficacy diminishes significantly when substantial geometric divergence exists between the physical and virtual environments, leading to unavoidable collisions. Existing scene generation methods primarily focus on object relationships or layout aesthetics, often neglecting the crucial aspect of physical compatibility required for effective RDW. To address this, we introduce HCVR (High Compatibility Virtual Reality Environment Generation), a novel framework that generates virtual scenes inherently optimized for alignment-based RDW controllers. HCVR first employs ENI++, a novel, boundary-sensitive metric to evaluate the incompatibility between physical and virtual spaces by comparing rotation-sensitive visibility polygons. Guided by the ENI++ compatibility map and user prompts, HCVR utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware 3D asset retrieval and initial layout generation. The framework then strategically adjusts object selection, scaling, and placement to maximize coverage of virtually incompatible regions, effectively guiding users towards RDW-feasible paths. User studies evaluating physical collisions and layout quality demonstrate HCVR's effectiveness with HCVR-generated scenes, resulting in 22.78 times fewer physical collisions and received 35.89\% less on ENI++ score compared to LLM-based generation with RDW, while also receiving 12.5\% higher scores on user feedback to layout design.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14679v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FARE: Fast-Slow Agentic Robotic Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14681</link><description>arXiv:2601.14681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work advances autonomous robot exploration by integrating agent-level semantic reasoning with fast local control. We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines. We further deploy FARE on hardware and validate it in complex, large scale $200m\times130m$ building environment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14681v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Local Language Models for Context-Aware Adaptive Anonymization of Sensitive Text</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14683</link><description>arXiv:2601.14683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14683v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dissecting Performance Degradation in Audio Source Separation under Sampling Frequency Mismatch</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14684</link><description>arXiv:2601.14684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio processing methods based on deep neural networks are typically trained at a single sampling frequency (SF). To handle untrained SFs, signal resampling is commonly employed, but it can degrade performance, particularly when the input SF is lower than the trained SF. This paper investigates the causes of this degradation through two hypotheses: (i) the lack of high-frequency components introduced by up-sampling, and (ii) the greater importance of their presence than their precise representation. To examine these hypotheses, we compare conventional resampling with three alternatives: post-resampling noise addition, which adds Gaussian noise to the resampled signal; noisy-kernel resampling, which perturbs the kernel with Gaussian noise to enrich high-frequency components; and trainable-kernel resampling, which adapts the interpolation kernel through training. Experiments on music source separation show that noisy-kernel and trainable-kernel resampling alleviate the degradation observed with conventional resampling. We further demonstrate that noisy-kernel resampling is effective across diverse models, highlighting it as a simple yet practical option.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14684v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IB-GRPO: Aligning LLM-based Learning Path Recommendation with Educational Objectives via Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14686</link><description>arXiv:2601.14686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning Path Recommendation (LPR) aims to generate personalized sequences of learning items that maximize long-term learning effect while respecting pedagogical principles and operational constraints. Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{\epsilon+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs. Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi using the KES simulator with a Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over representative RL and LLM baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14686v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Denial-of-Service: The Puppeteer's Attack for Fine-Grained Control in Ranking-Based Federated Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14687</link><description>arXiv:2601.14687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy.

Abstract: Power distribution networks are increasingly hosting controllable and flexible distributed energy resources (DERs) that, when aggregated, can provide ancillary support to transmission systems. However, existing aggregation schemes often ignore the ramping constraints of these DERs, which can render them impractical in real deployments. This work proposes a ramping-aware flexibility aggregation scheme, computed at the transmission-distribution boundary, that explicitly accounts for DER ramp limits and yields flexibility envelopes that are provably disaggregable. To further enhance the attainable flexibility region, we introduce a novel pre-ramping strategy, which proactively adjusts resource operating points to enlarge the aggregated flexibility envelope while preserving both network feasibility and disaggregation guarantees. The proposed method demonstrates a 5.2% to 19.2% improvement in flexibility relative to the baseline model, depending on system conditions. We validate the scheme on an IEEE-33 bus distribution system and provide formal proofs showing that both aggregation strategies are disaggregable for all feasible trajectories within the aggregate flexibility envelope.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14689v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FeedbackSTS-Det: Sparse Frames-Based Spatio-Temporal Semantic Feedback Network for Infrared Small Target Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14690</link><description>arXiv:2601.14690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) under complex backgrounds remains a critical yet challenging task, primarily due to the extremely low signal-to-clutter ratio, persistent dynamic interference, and the lack of distinct target features. While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/IDIP-Lab/FeedbackSTS-Det.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14690v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Gaming the Judge: Unfaithful Chain-of-Thought Can Undermine Agent Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14691</link><description>arXiv:2601.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to evaluate agent performance, particularly in non-verifiable settings where judgments rely on agent trajectories including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14691v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Error-Based Optimization: Experience-Driven Symbolic Regression with Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14693</link><description>arXiv:2601.14693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to automatically identify compact and interpretable mathematical expressions that model the functional relationship between input and output variables. Most existing search-based symbolic regression methods typically rely on the fitting error to inform the search process. However, in the vast expression space, numerous candidate expressions may exhibit similar error values while differing substantially in structure, leading to ambiguous search directions and hindering convergence to the underlying true function. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Re-understanding Graph Unlearning through Memorization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14694</link><description>arXiv:2601.14694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph unlearning (GU), which removes nodes, edges, or features from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial in Web applications where graph data may contain sensitive, mislabeled, or malicious information. However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14694v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoScale-RL: Efficient Post-Training by Co-Scaling Data and Computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14695</link><description>arXiv:2601.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training Large Reasoning Model (LRM) is usually unstable and unpredictable, especially on hard problems or weak foundation models. We found that the current post-training scaling strategy can still improve on these cases. We propose CoScale-RL, a novel scaling strategy with better data and computational efficiency. We first scale up solutions to make problems solvable. The core idea is to collect multiple solutions for each problem, rather than simply enlarging the dataset. Then, we scale up rollout computation to stabilize Reinforcement Learning. We further leverage a model merge technique called Re-distillation to sustain or even improve computational efficiency when scaling up. Our method significantly improves data and computational efficiency, with an average 3.76$\times$ accuracy improvement on four benchmarks. CoScale-RL is able to improve an LRM's ability boundary without an extensive SFT dataset. Our method provides a new scaling direction to further improve LRM's reasoning ability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14695v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AdaTIR: Adaptive Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Policy Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14696</link><description>arXiv:2601.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current agents tend to exhibit cognitive offloading, redundantly invoking external tools even for simple tasks. In this paper, we suggest that true agentic intelligence requires not just tool invocation, but the adaptive wisdom to discern when to use them. We propose AdaTIR, a framework that shifts the paradigm from static tool invocation to difficulty-aware reasoning internalization. By introducing a difficulty-aware efficiency reward, AdaTIR dynamically adjusts tool budgets based on task complexity--internalizing reasoning for simple tasks while selectively invoking tools for complex tasks. Furthermore, we identify a sign reversal problem where tool penalties outweigh correctness rewards, mistakenly penalizing correct rollouts with negative advantages. To resolve this, we propose Clipped Advantage Shaping (CAS), which ensures that correctness remains the primary objective while using efficiency as a secondary constraint. Empirical results demonstrate that AdaTIR reduces tool calls by up to 97.6% on simple tasks and 28.2% on complex challenges while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. Notably, AdaTIR successfully internalizes reasoning, outperforming baselines by 4.8% on AIME 2024 even when tool access is strictly disabled.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14696v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Text-as-Vision Meets Semantic IDs in Generative Recommendation: An Empirical Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14697</link><description>arXiv:2601.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic ID learning is a key interface in Generative Recommendation (GR) models, mapping items to discrete identifiers grounded in side information, most commonly via a pretrained text encoder. However, these text encoders are primarily optimized for well-formed natural language. In real-world recommendation data, item descriptions are often symbolic and attribute-centric, containing numerals, units, and abbreviations. These text encoders can break these signals into fragmented tokens, weakening semantic coherence and distorting relationships among attributes. Worse still, when moving to multimodal GR, relying on standard text encoders introduces an additional obstacle: text and image embeddings often exhibit mismatched geometric structures, making cross-modal fusion less effective and less stable.
  In this paper, we revisit representation design for Semantic ID learning by treating text as a visual signal. We conduct a systematic empirical study of OCR-based text representations, obtained by rendering item descriptions into images and encoding them with vision-based OCR models. Experiments across four datasets and two generative backbones show that OCR-text consistently matches or surpasses standard text embeddings for Semantic ID learning in both unimodal and multimodal settings. Furthermore, we find that OCR-based Semantic IDs remain robust under extreme spatial-resolution compression, indicating strong robustness and efficiency in practical deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14697v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ClaimDB: A Fact Verification Benchmark over Large Structured Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14698</link><description>arXiv:2601.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite substantial progress in fact-verification benchmarks, claims grounded in large-scale structured data remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce ClaimDB, the first fact-verification benchmark where the evidence for claims is derived from compositions of millions of records and multiple tables. ClaimDB consists of 80 unique real-life databases covering a wide range of domains, from governance and healthcare to media, education and the natural sciences. At this scale, verification approaches that rely on "reading" the evidence break down, forcing a timely shift toward reasoning in executable programs. We conduct extensive experiments with 30 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source (below 70B) LLMs and find that none exceed 83% accuracy, with more than half below 55%. Our analysis also reveals that both closed- and open-source models struggle with abstention -- the ability to admit that there is no evidence to decide -- raising doubts about their reliability in high-stakes data analysis.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated promising gains in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, its dependence on domain-specific verifiers significantly restricts its applicability to open and general domains. Recent efforts such as RLPR have extended RLVR to general domains, enabling training on broader datasets and achieving improvements over RLVR. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their tendency to overfit to reference answers, which constrains the model's ability to generate diverse outputs. This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-ended tasks such as writing, where multiple plausible answers exist. To address this, we propose DARL, a simple yet effective reinforcement learning framework that encourages the generation of diverse answers within a controlled deviation range from the reference while preserving alignment with it. Our framework is fully compatible with existing general reinforcement learning methods and can be seamlessly integrated without additional verifiers. Extensive experiments on thirteen benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in reasoning performance. Notably, DARL surpasses RLPR, achieving average gains of 1.3 points on six reasoning benchmarks and 9.5 points on seven general benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving both reasoning accuracy and output diversity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14700v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AutoDriDM: An Explainable Benchmark for Decision-Making of Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14702</link><description>arXiv:2601.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving is a highly challenging domain that requires reliable perception and safe decision-making in complex scenarios. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14702v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RegFreeNet: A Registration-Free Network for CBCT-based 3D Dental Implant Planning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14703</link><description>arXiv:2601.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the commercial surgical guide design software usually does not support the export of implant position for pre-implantation data, existing methods have to scan the post-implantation data and map the implant to pre-implantation space to get the label of implant position for training. Such a process is time-consuming and heavily relies on the accuracy of registration algorithm. Moreover, not all hospitals have paired CBCT data, limitting the construction of multi-center dataset. Inspired by the way dentists determine the implant position based on the neighboring tooth texture, we found that even if the implant area is masked, it will not affect the determination of the implant position. Therefore, we propose to mask the implants in the post-implantation data so that any CBCT containing the implants can be used as training data. This paradigm enables us to discard the registration process and makes it possible to construct a large-scale multi-center implant dataset. On this basis, we proposes ImplantFairy, a comprehensive, publicly accessible dental implant dataset with voxel-level 3D annotations of 1622 CBCT data. Furthermore, according to the area variation characteristics of the tooth's spatial structure and the slope information of the implant, we designed a slope-aware implant position prediction network. Specifically, a neighboring distance perception (NDP) module is designed to adaptively extract tooth area variation features, and an implant slope prediction branch assists the network in learning more robust features through additional implant supervision information. Extensive experiments conducted on ImplantFairy and two public dataset demonstrate that the proposed RegFreeNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14703v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Optimization Based Multi-objective Dynamic Regulation Scheme for VANET Topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14704</link><description>arXiv:2601.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a core technology of intelligent transportation systems, vehicular ad-hoc networks support latency-sensitive services such as safety warning and cooperative perception via vehicle-to-everything communications. However, their highly dynamic topology increases average path length, raises latency, and reduces throughput, severely limiting communication performance. Existing topology optimization methods lack capabilities in multi-objective coordination, dynamic adaptation, and global-local synergy. To address this, this paper proposes a two-layer dynamic topology regulation scheme combining local feature aggregation and global adjustment. The scheme constructs a dynamic multi-objective optimization model integrating average path length, end-to-end latency, and network throughput, and achieves multi-index coordination via link adaptability metrics and a dynamic normalization mechanism. it quickly responds to local link changes via feature fusion of local node feature extraction and dynamic neighborhood sensing, and balances optimization accuracy and real-time performance using a dual-mode adaptive solving strategy for global topology adjustment. It reduces network oscillation risks by introducing a performance improvement threshold and a topology validity verification mechanism. Simulation results on real urban road networks via the SUMO platform show that the proposed scheme outperforms traditional methods in average path length (stabilizing at ~4 hops), end-to-end latency (remaining ~0.01 s), and network throughput.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14704v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Proximal Policy Optimization with Evolutionary Mutations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14705</link><description>arXiv:2601.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm known for its stability and sample efficiency, but it often suffers from premature convergence due to limited exploration. In this paper, we propose POEM (Proximal Policy Optimization with Evolutionary Mutations), a novel modification to PPO that introduces an adaptive exploration mechanism inspired by evolutionary algorithms. POEM enhances policy diversity by monitoring the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a moving average of previous policies. When policy changes become minimal, indicating stagnation, POEM triggers an adaptive mutation of policy parameters to promote exploration. We evaluate POEM on four OpenAI Gym environments: CarRacing, MountainCar, BipedalWalker, and LunarLander. Through extensive fine-tuning using Bayesian optimization techniques and statistical testing using Welch's t-test, we find that POEM significantly outperforms PPO on three of the four tasks (BipedalWalker: t=-2.0642, p=0.0495; CarRacing: t=-6.3987, p=0.0002; MountainCar: t=-6.2431, p&lt;0.0001), while performance on LunarLander is not statistically significant (t=-1.8707, p=0.0778). Our results highlight the potential of integrating evolutionary principles into policy gradient methods to overcome exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14705v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LookBench: A Live and Holistic Open Benchmark for Fashion Image Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14706</link><description>arXiv:2601.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present LookBench (We use the term "look" to reflect retrieval that mirrors how people shop -- finding the exact item, a close substitute, or a visually consistent alternative.), a live, holistic and challenging benchmark for fashion image retrieval in real e-commerce settings.

Abstract: Optimally sequencing experimental assays in drug discovery is a high-stakes planning problem under severe uncertainty and resource constraints. A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner. IBMDP offers a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14710v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DARA: Few-shot Budget Allocation in Online Advertising via In-Context Decision Making with RL-Finetuned LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14711</link><description>arXiv:2601.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the advertiser's cumulative value of winning impressions under budget constraints poses a complex challenge in online advertising, under the paradigm of AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB). Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14711v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unified Multimodal and Multilingual Retrieval via Multi-Task Learning with NLU Integration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14714</link><description>arXiv:2601.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal retrieval systems typically employ Vision Language Models (VLMs) that encode images and text independently into vectors within a shared embedding space. Despite incorporating text encoders, VLMs consistently underperform specialized text models on text-only retrieval tasks. Moreover, introducing additional text encoders increases storage, inference overhead, and exacerbates retrieval inefficiencies, especially in multilingual settings. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-task learning framework that unifies the feature representation across images, long and short texts, and intent-rich queries. To our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly optimize multilingual image retrieval, text retrieval, and natural language understanding (NLU) tasks within a single framework. Our approach integrates image and text retrieval with a shared text encoder that is enhanced by NLU features for intent understanding and retrieval accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14714v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PCL-Reasoner-V1.5: Advancing Math Reasoning with Offline Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14716</link><description>arXiv:2601.14716v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which relies only on image-level labels, has attracted significant attention for its cost-effectiveness and scalability. Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 validate that CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14718v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PULSE: Socially-Aware User Representation Modeling Toward Parameter-Efficient Graph Collaborative Filtering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14720</link><description>arXiv:2601.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based social recommendation (SocialRec) has emerged as a powerful extension of graph collaborative filtering (GCF), which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture multi-hop collaborative signals from user-item interactions. These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user. PULSE reduces the parameter size by up to 50% compared to the most lightweight GCF baseline. Beyond parameter efficiency, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 13 GCF and graph-based social recommendation baselines across varying levels of interaction sparsity, from cold-start to highly active users, through a time- and memory-efficient modeling process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14720v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Typhoon OCR: Open Vision-Language Model For Thai Document Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14722</link><description>arXiv:2601.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document extraction is a core component of digital workflows, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) predominantly favor high-resource languages. Thai presents additional challenges due to script complexity from non-latin letters, the absence of explicit word boundaries, and the prevalence of highly unstructured real-world documents, limiting the effectiveness of current open-source models. This paper presents Typhoon OCR, an open VLM for document extraction tailored for Thai and English. The model is fine-tuned from vision-language backbones using a Thai-focused training dataset. The dataset is developed using a multi-stage data construction pipeline that combines traditional OCR, VLM-based restructuring, and curated synthetic data. Typhoon OCR is a unified framework capable of text transcription, layout reconstruction, and document-level structural consistency. The latest iteration of our model, Typhoon OCR V1.5, is a compact and inference-efficient model designed to reduce reliance on metadata and simplify deployment. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse Thai document categories, including financial reports, government forms, books, infographics, and handwritten documents, show that Typhoon OCR achieves performance comparable to or exceeding larger frontier proprietary models, despite substantially lower computational cost. The results demonstrate that open vision-language OCR models can achieve accurate text extraction and layout reconstruction for Thai documents, reaching performance comparable to proprietary systems while remaining lightweight and deployable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14722v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HERMES: KV Cache as Hierarchical Memory for Efficient Streaming Video Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14724</link><description>arXiv:2601.14724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14724v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differential Privacy on Affine Manifolds: Geometrically Confined Privacy in Linear Dynamical Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14725</link><description>arXiv:2601.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for differential privacy over affine manifolds and validate its usefulness in the contexts of differentially private cloud-based control and average consensus. We consider differential privacy mechanisms for linear queries when the input data are constrained to lie on affine manifolds, a structural property that is assumed to be available as prior knowledge to adversaries. In this setting, the definition of neighborhood adjacency must be formulated with respect to the intrinsic geometry of the manifolds. We demonstrate that such affine-manifold constraints can fundamentally alter the attainable privacy levels relative to the unconstrained case. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which differential privacy can be realized via structured noise injection mechanisms, wherein correlated Gaussian or Laplace noise distributions, rather than i.i.d. perturbations, are calibrated to the dataset. Based on these characterizations, we develop explicit noise calibration procedures that guarantee the tight realization of any prescribed privacy budget with a matching noise magnitude. Finally, we show that the proposed framework admits direct applications to linear dynamical systems ranging from differentially private cloud-based control to privacy-preserving average consensus, all of which naturally involve affine-manifold constraints. The established theoretical results are illustrated through numerical examples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14725v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FSX: Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer for Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14730</link><description>arXiv:2601.14730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), understanding the reasons behind their specific predictions remains challenging. Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14730v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARFT-Transformer: Modeling Metric Dependencies for Cross-Project Aging-Related Bug Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14731</link><description>arXiv:2601.14731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software systems that run for long periods often suffer from software aging, which is typically caused by Aging-Related Bugs (ARBs). To mitigate the risk of ARBs early in the development phase, ARB prediction has been introduced into software aging research. However, due to the difficulty of collecting ARBs, within-project ARB prediction faces the challenge of data scarcity, leading to the proposal of cross-project ARB prediction. This task faces two major challenges: 1) domain adaptation issue caused by distribution difference between source and target projects; and 2) severe class imbalance between ARB-prone and ARB-free samples. Although various methods have been proposed for cross-project ARB prediction, existing approaches treat the input metrics independently and often neglect the rich inter-metric dependencies, which can lead to overlapping information and misjudgment of metric importance, potentially affecting the model's performance. Moreover, they typically use cross-entropy as the loss function during training, which cannot distinguish the difficulty of sample classification. To overcome these limitations, we propose ARFT-Transformer, a transformer-based cross-project ARB prediction framework that introduces a metric-level multi-head attention mechanism to capture metric interactions and incorporates Focal Loss function to effectively handle class imbalance. Experiments conducted on three large-scale open-source projects demonstrate that ARFT-Transformer on average outperforms state-of-the-art cross-project ARB prediction methods in both single-source and multi-source cases, achieving up to a 29.54% and 19.92% improvement in Balance metric.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14731v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepMoLM: Leveraging Visual and Geometric Structural Information for Molecule-Text Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14732</link><description>arXiv:2601.14732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI models for drug discovery and chemical literature mining must interpret molecular images and generate outputs consistent with 3D geometry and stereochemistry. Most molecular language models rely on strings or graphs, while vision-language models often miss stereochemical details and struggle to map continuous 3D structures into discrete tokens. We propose DeepMoLM: Deep Molecular Language M odeling, a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. DeepMoLM preserves high-frequency evidence from 1024 $\times$ 1024 inputs, encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints, and fuses visual and geometric streams with cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without atom coordinates. DeepMoLM improves PubChem captioning with a 12.3% relative METEOR gain over the strongest generalist baseline while staying competitive with specialist methods. It produces valid numeric outputs for all property queries and attains MAE 13.64 g/mol on Molecular Weight and 37.89 on Complexity in the specialist setting. On ChEBI-20 description generation from images, it exceeds generalist baselines and matches state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Abstract: Agentic workflows that use autonomous AI Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers is rapidly rising. This introduces challenges in scalable cloud deployment and state management. Traditional hosting on Virtual Machines (VMs) is resource-intensive and lacks elasticity. Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer modularity, autoscaling and cost efficiency but are inherently stateless. In this paper, we present the FAME, a FaaS-based architecture for orchestrating MCP-enabled agentic workflows. FAME decomposes agentic patterns such as ReAct into composable agents: Planner, Actor and Evaluator, that are each a FaaS function built using LangGraph and are orchestrated as a FaaS workflow. This enables modular composition as AWS Step Functions and avoids function timeouts seen for monolithic agentic workflows. To address context persistence across user requests in a conversation, FAME automates agent memory persistence and injection using DynamoDB. It also optimizes MCP server deployment through AWS Lambda wrappers, caches tool outputs in S3 and proposes function fusion strategies. We evaluate FAME on two representative applications, on research paper summarization and log analytics, under diverse memory and caching configurations. Results show up to 13x latency reduction, 88% fewer input tokens and 66% in cost savings, along with improved workflow completion rates. This demonstrates the viability of serverless platforms for hosting complex, multi-agent AI workflows at scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trajectory-Driven Multi-Product Influence Maximization in Billboard Advertising</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14737</link><description>arXiv:2601.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Billboard Advertising has emerged as an effective out-of-home advertising technique, where the goal is to select a limited number of slots and play advertisement content there, with the hope that it will be observed by many people and, effectively, a significant number of them will be influenced towards the brand. Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \ldots, k_{\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_{\ell}$ such that for all $i \in [\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \leq k_i$ and for all $i \neq j$, $S_i \cap S_j=\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14737v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Safeguarding Facial Identity against Diffusion-based Face Swapping via Cascading Pathway Disruption</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14738</link><description>arXiv:2601.14738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of diffusion models has democratized face swapping but also raises concerns about privacy and identity security. Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality. Extensive experiments show that VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based swapping models, while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14738v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Text-to-Image Generation via End-Edge Collaborative Hybrid Super-Resolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14741</link><description>arXiv:2601.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has made significant strides, with high-resolution text-to-image (T2I) generation becoming increasingly critical for improving users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14741v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SimD3: A Synthetic drone Dataset with Payload and Bird Distractor Modeling for Robust Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14742</link><description>arXiv:2601.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable drone detection is challenging due to limited annotated real-world data, large appearance variability, and the presence of visually similar distractors such as birds. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SimD3, a large-scale high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed for robust drone detection in complex aerial environments. Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that SimD3 provides effective supervision for small-object drone detection and that Yolov5m+C3b consistently outperforms the baseline across in-domain and cross-dataset evaluations. These findings highlight the utility of SimD3 for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse and challenging conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14742v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ARISE -- Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Scenario Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14743</link><description>arXiv:2601.14743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of collision-free trajectory planners depends on the quality and diversity of training data, especially for rare scenarios. A widely used approach to improve dataset diversity involves generating realistic synthetic traffic scenarios. However, producing such scenarios remains difficult due to the precision required when scripting them manually or generating them in a single pass. Natural language offers a flexible way to describe scenarios, but existing text-to-simulation pipelines often rely on static snippet retrieval, limited grammar, single-pass decoding, or lack robust executability checks. Moreover, they depend heavily on constrained LLM prompting with minimal post-processing. To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE - Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Scenario Engineering, a multi-stage tool that converts natural language prompts into executable Scenic scripts through iterative LLM-guided refinement. After each generation, ARISE tests script executability in simulation software, feeding structured diagnostics back to the LLM until both syntactic and functional requirements are met. This process significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. Through extensive evaluation, ARISE outperforms the baseline in generating semantically accurate and executable traffic scenarios with greater reliability and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14743v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unlocking Large Audio-Language Models for Interactive Language Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14744</link><description>arXiv:2601.14744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving pronunciation proficiency in a second language (L2) remains a challenge, despite the development of Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems. Traditional CAPT systems often provide unintuitive feedback that lacks actionable guidance, limiting its effectiveness. Recent advancements in audio-language models (ALMs) offer the potential to enhance these systems by providing more user-friendly feedback. In this work, we investigate ALMs for chat-based pronunciation training by introducing L2-Arctic-plus, an English dataset with detailed error explanations and actionable suggestions for improvement. We benchmark cascaded ASR+LLMs and existing ALMs on this dataset, specifically in detecting mispronunciation and generating actionable feedback. To improve the performance, we further propose to instruction-tune ALMs on L2-Arctic-plus. Experimental results demonstrate that our instruction-tuned models significantly outperform existing baselines on mispronunciation detection and suggestion generation in terms of both objective and human evaluation, highlighting the value of the proposed dataset.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14744v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RefProtoFL: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning via External-Referenced Prototype Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14746</link><description>arXiv:2601.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data in edge environments, but is constrained by limited communication bandwidth and heterogeneous client data distributions. Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RefProtoFL attains higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art prototype-based FL baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14746v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Render-of-Thought: Rendering Textual Chain-of-Thought as Images for Visual Latent Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14750</link><description>arXiv:2601.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in unlocking the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT. Furthermore, it maintains competitive performance against other methods, validating the feasibility of this paradigm.

Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of movable antennas (MAs) to enhance physical layer security within a multiple-input multiple-output multiple-antenna eavesdropper (MIMOME) system. We consider a practical scenario where the transmitter operates with imperfect eavesdropper channel state information (ECSI), knowing only the instantaneous line-of-sight (LoS) component and the statistical properties of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) component. To rigorously quantify secrecy performance under the ECSI uncertainty, we adopt the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) as the metric. Since deriving an exact analytical expression for the ESR is intractable, we leverage random matrix theory to derive a deterministic equivalent. This avoids heavy Monte Carlo simulations and also provides explicit insights into the effects of channel spatial statistics on secrecy performance. Building upon the deterministic equivalent, we formulate a joint maximization problem for the transmit precoding matrix and the antenna positions at the legitimate transmitter. To tackle the non-convexity of this optimization problem, we develop a comprehensive alternating optimization framework. Specifically, the precoding matrix is optimized via a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, where the gradient is computed by solving an implicit fixed-point equation. For the antenna position optimization, the complexity of the objective function prevents the construction of standard MM surrogate. To this end, we further propose a novel AMSGrad-based surrogate function that relies solely on gradient information. We provide a rigorous theoretical proof that guarantees the convergence of this proposed algorithm despite relaxing the strict majorization conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14755v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReinPath: A Multimodal Reinforcement Learning Approach for Pathology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14757</link><description>arXiv:2601.14757v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Post-training pretrained Autoregressive models (ARMs) into Masked Diffusion models (MDMs) has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to overcome the limitations of sequential generation. However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic "mechanism shift" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14758v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An XAI View on Explainable ASP: Methods, Systems, and Perspectives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14764</link><description>arXiv:2601.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a popular declarative reasoning and problem solving approach in symbolic AI. Its rule-based formalism makes it inherently attractive for explainable and interpretive reasoning, which is gaining importance with the surge of Explainable AI (XAI). A number of explanation approaches and tools for ASP have been developed, which often tackle specific explanatory settings and may not cover all scenarios that ASP users encounter. In this survey, we provide, guided by an XAI perspective, an overview of types of ASP explanations in connection with user questions for explanation, and describe how their coverage by current theory and tools. Furthermore, we pinpoint gaps in existing ASP explanations approaches and identify research directions for future work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14764v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Anytime Optimal Decision Tree Learning with Continuous Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14765</link><description>arXiv:2601.14765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made on algorithms for learning optimal decision trees, primarily in the context of binary features. Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing one in terms of anytime performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14765v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PAColorHolo: A Perceptually-Aware Color Management Framework for Holographic Displays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14766</link><description>arXiv:2601.14766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic displays offer significant potential for augmented and virtual reality applications by reconstructing wavefronts that enable continuous depth cues and natural parallax without vergence-accommodation conflict. However, despite advances in pixel-level image quality, current systems struggle to achieve perceptually accurate color reproduction--an essential component of visual realism. These challenges arise from complex system-level distortions caused by coherent laser illumination, spatial light modulator imperfections, chromatic aberrations, and camera-induced color biases. In this work, we propose a perceptually-aware color management framework for holographic displays that jointly addresses input-output color inconsistencies through color space transformation, adaptive illumination control, and neural network-based perceptual modeling of the camera's color response. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical simulations, optical experiments, and a controlled user study. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in perceptual color fidelity, laying the groundwork for perceptually driven holographic rendering in future systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14766v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Using Multi-Instance Learning to Identify Unique Polyps in Colon Capsule Endoscopy Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14771</link><description>arXiv:2601.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying unique polyps in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images is a critical yet challenging task for medical personnel due to the large volume of images, the cognitive load it creates for clinicians, and the ambiguity in labeling specific frames. This paper formulates this problem as a multi-instance learning (MIL) task, where a query polyp image is compared with a target bag of images to determine uniqueness. We employ a multi-instance verification (MIV) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms, such as variance-excited multi-head attention (VEMA) and distance-based attention (DBA), to enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful representations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of self-supervised learning using SimCLR to generate robust embeddings. Experimental results on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients demonstrate that attention mechanisms significantly improve performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26\% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone with SimCLR pretraining. This study underscores the potential of MIL and self-supervised learning in advancing automated analysis of Colon Capsule Endoscopy images, with implications for broader medical imaging applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14771v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14773</link><description>arXiv:2601.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video summarization is a crucial technique for social understanding, enabling efficient browsing of massive multimedia content and extraction of key information from social platforms. Most existing unsupervised summarization methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance keyframe selection and generate coherent, video summaries through adversarial training. However, such approaches primarily exploit unimodal features, overlooking the guiding role of semantic information in keyframe selection, and often suffer from unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method. Specifically, we design a novel frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism and integrate it into a keyframe selector, which guides the Transformer-based generator within the adversarial framework to better reconstruct videos. In addition, we adopt an incremental training strategy to progressively update the model components, effectively mitigating the instability of GAN training. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14773v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Does medical specialization of VLMs enhance discriminative power?: A comprehensive investigation through feature distribution analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14774</link><description>arXiv:2601.14774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the feature representations produced by publicly available open source medical vision-language models (VLMs). While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14774v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] M2I2HA: A Multi-modal Object Detection Method Based on Intra- and Inter-Modal Hypergraph Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14776</link><description>arXiv:2601.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal detection have significantly improved detection accuracy in challenging environments (e.g., low light, overexposure). By integrating RGB with modalities such as thermal and depth, multi-modal fusion increases data redundancy and system robustness. However, significant challenges remain in effectively extracting task-relevant information both within and across modalities, as well as in achieving precise cross-modal alignment. While CNNs excel at feature extraction, they are limited by constrained receptive fields, strong inductive biases, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models offer global context but suffer from quadratic computational complexity and are confined to pairwise correlation modeling. Mamba and other State Space Models (SSMs), on the other hand, are hindered by their sequential scanning mechanism, which flattens 2D spatial structures into 1D sequences, disrupting topological relationships and limiting the modeling of complex higher-order dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a multi-modal perception network based on hypergraph theory called M2I2HA. Our architecture includes an Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement module to capture global many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, and an Inter-Hypergraph Fusion module to align, enhance, and fuse cross-modal features by bridging configuration and spatial gaps between data sources. We further introduce a M2-FullPAD module to enable adaptive multi-level fusion of multi-modal enhanced features within the network, meanwhile enhancing data distribution and flow across the architecture. Extensive object detection experiments on multiple public datasets against baselines demonstrate that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14776v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FunCineForge: A Unified Dataset Toolkit and Model for Zero-Shot Movie Dubbing in Diverse Cinematic Scenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14777</link><description>arXiv:2601.14777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movie dubbing is the task of synthesizing speech from scripts conditioned on video scenes, requiring accurate lip sync, faithful timbre transfer, and proper modeling of character identity and emotion. However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show that our dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

Abstract: Recent provably secure linguistic steganography (PSLS) methods rely on mainstream autoregressive language models (ARMs) to address historically challenging tasks, that is, to disguise covert communication as ``innocuous'' natural language communication. However, due to the characteristic of sequential generation of ARMs, the stegotext generated by ARM-based PSLS methods will produce serious error propagation once it changes, making existing methods unavailable under an active tampering attack. To address this, we propose a robust, provably secure linguistic steganography with diffusion language models (DLMs). Unlike ARMs, DLMs can generate text in a partially parallel manner, allowing us to find robust positions for steganographic embedding that can be combined with error-correcting codes. Furthermore, we introduce error correction strategies, including pseudo-random error correction and neighborhood search correction, during steganographic extraction. Theoretical proof and experimental results demonstrate that our method is secure and robust. It can resist token ambiguity in stegotext segmentation and, to some extent, withstand token-level attacks of insertion, deletion, and substitution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14778v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RECAP: Resistance Capture in Text-based Mental Health Counseling with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14780</link><description>arXiv:2601.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing and navigating client resistance is critical for effective mental health counseling, yet detecting such behaviors is particularly challenging in text-based interactions. Existing NLP approaches oversimplify resistance categories, ignore the sequential dynamics of therapeutic interventions, and offer limited interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we propose PsyFIRE, a theoretically grounded framework capturing 13 fine-grained resistance behaviors alongside collaborative interactions. Based on PsyFIRE, we construct the ClientResistance corpus with 23,930 annotated utterances from real-world Chinese text-based counseling, each supported by context-specific rationales. Leveraging this dataset, we develop RECAP, a two-stage framework that detects resistance and fine-grained resistance types with explanations.
  RECAP achieves 91.25% F1 for distinguishing collaboration and resistance and 66.58% macro-F1 for fine-grained resistance categories classification, outperforming leading prompt-based LLM baselines by over 20 points. Applied to a separate counseling dataset and a pilot study with 62 counselors, RECAP reveals the prevalence of resistance, its negative impact on therapeutic relationships and demonstrates its potential to improve counselors' understanding and intervention strategies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14780v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Bound Consistency for the No-Overlap Constraint Using MDDs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14784</link><description>arXiv:2601.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving bound consistency for the no-overlap constraint is known to be NP-complete. Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Cir\'e and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \mid r_j, d_j, \bar{d}_j \mid \sum E_j + \sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Cir\'e and van Hoeve. The new filtering also appears to be complementary to classical propagation methods for the no-overlap constraint, allowing a substantial reduction in both the number of nodes and the solving time on several instances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14784v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training-Efficient Text-to-Music Generation with State-Space Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14786</link><description>arXiv:2601.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music generation (TTM) have yielded high-quality results, but often at the cost of extensive compute and the use of large proprietary internal data. To improve the affordability and openness of TTM training, an open-source generative model backbone that is more training- and data-efficient is needed. In this paper, we constrain the number of trainable parameters in the generative model to match that of the MusicGen-small benchmark (with about 300M parameters), and replace its Transformer backbone with the emerging class of state-space models (SSMs). Specifically, we explore different SSM variants for sequence modeling, and compare a single-stage SSM-based design with a decomposable two-stage SSM/diffusion hybrid design. All proposed models are trained from scratch on a purely public dataset comprising 457 hours of CC-licensed music, ensuring full openness. Our experimental findings are three-fold. First, we show that SSMs exhibit superior training efficiency compared to the Transformer counterpart. Second, despite using only 9% of the FLOPs and 2% of the training data size compared to the MusicGen-small benchmark, our model achieves competitive performance in both objective metrics and subjective listening tests based on MusicCaps captions. Finally, our scaling-down experiment demonstrates that SSMs can maintain competitive performance relative to the Transformer baseline even at the same training budget (measured in iterations), when the model size is reduced to four times smaller. To facilitate the democratization of TTM research, the processed captions, model checkpoints, and source code are available on GitHub via the project page: https://lonian6.github.io/ssmttm/.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14786v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model for Text-to-Motion Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14788</link><description>arXiv:2601.14788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have seen widespread adoption for text-driven human motion generation and related tasks due to their impressive generative capabilities and flexibility. However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14788v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CI4A: Semantic Component Interfaces for Agents Empowering Web Automation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14790</link><description>arXiv:2601.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in high-level semantic planning, they remain limited in handling fine-grained, low-level web component manipulations. To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the CI4A-based agent significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new SoTA task success rate of 86.3%, alongside substantial improvements in execution efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14790v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-Task Chinese Porcelain Classification: A Stable Diffusion Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14791</link><description>arXiv:2601.14791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of training data presents a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to archaeological artifact classification, particularly for the rare types of Chinese porcelain. This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures. Our work contributes practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of synthetic data when archaeological authenticity must be balanced with data diversity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14791v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robustness of Mixtures of Experts to Feature Noise</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14792</link><description>arXiv:2601.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their practical success, it remains unclear why Mixture of Experts (MoE) models can outperform dense networks beyond sheer parameter scaling. We study an iso-parameter regime where inputs exhibit latent modular structure but are corrupted by feature noise, a proxy for noisy internal activations. We show that sparse expert activation acts as a noise filter: compared to a dense estimator, MoEs achieve lower generalization error under feature noise, improved robustness to perturbations, and faster convergence speed. Empirical results on synthetic data and real-world language tasks corroborate the theoretical insights, demonstrating consistent robustness and efficiency gains from sparse modular computation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14792v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RANDSMAPs: Random-Feature/multi-Scale Neural Decoders with Mass Preservation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14794</link><description>arXiv:2601.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce RANDSMAPs (Random-feature/multi-scale neural decoders with Mass Preservation), numerical analysis-informed, explainable neural decoders designed to explicitly respect conservation laws when solving the challenging ill-posed pre-image problem in manifold learning. We start by proving the equivalence of vanilla random Fourier feature neural networks to Radial Basis Function interpolation and the double Diffusion Maps (based on Geometric Harmonics) decoders in the deterministic limit. We then establish the theoretical foundations for RANDSMAP and introduce its multiscale variant to capture structures across multiple scales. We formulate and derive the closed-form solution of the corresponding constrained optimization problem and prove the mass preservation property. Numerically, we assess the performance of RANDSMAP on three benchmark problems/datasets with mass preservation obtained by the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards traffic flow PDE with shock waves, 2D rotated MRI brain images, and the Hughes crowd dynamics PDEs. We demonstrate that RANDSMAPs yield high reconstruction accuracy at low computational cost and maintain mass conservation at single-machine precision. In its vanilla formulation, the scheme remains applicable to the classical pre-image problem, i.e., when mass-preservation constraints are not imposed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14794v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reflecting in the Reflection: Integrating a Socratic Questioning Framework into Automated AI-Based Question Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14798</link><description>arXiv:2601.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing good reflection questions is pedagogically important but time-consuming and unevenly supported across teachers. This paper introduces a reflection-in-reflection framework for automated generation of reflection questions with large language models (LLMs). Our approach coordinates two role-specialized agents, a Student-Teacher and a Teacher-Educator, that engage in a Socratic multi-turn dialogue to iteratively refine a single question given a teacher-specified topic, key concepts, student level, and optional instructional materials. The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue. We evaluate the framework in an authentic lower-secondary ICT setting on the topic, using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone model and a stronger GPT- 4-class LLM as an external evaluator in pairwise comparisons of clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality. First, we study how interaction design and context (dynamic vs.fixed iteration counts; presence or absence of student level and materials) affect question quality. Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication. Second, we show that our two-agent protocol produces questions that are judged substantially more relevant and deeper, and better overall, than a one-shot baseline using the same backbone model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14798v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] UBATrack: Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for General Multi-Modal Tracking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14799</link><description>arXiv:2601.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14799v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FastFI: Enhancing API Call-Site Robustness in Microservice-Based Systems with Fault Injection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14800</link><description>arXiv:2601.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault injection is a key technique for assessing software reliability, enabling proactive detection of system defects before they manifest in production. However, the increasing complexity of microservice architectures leads to exponential growth in the fault-injection space, rendering traditional random injection inefficient. Recent lineage-driven approaches mitigate this problem through heuristic pruning, but they face two limitations. First, combinatorial-fault discovery remains bottlenecked by general-purpose SAT solvers, which fail to exploit the monotone and low-overlap structure of derived CNF formulas and typically rely on a static upper bound on fault size. Second, existing techniques provide limited post-injection guidance beyond reporting detected faults. To address these challenges, we propose FastFI, a fault-injection-guided framework to enhance the robustness of API call sites in microservice-based systems. FastFI features a DFS-based solver with dynamic fault injection to discover all valid combinatorial faults, and it leverages fault-injection results to identify critical APIs whose call sites should be hardened for robustness. Experiments on four representative microservice benchmarks show that FastFI reduces end-to-end fault-injection time by an average of 76.12\% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining acceptable resource overhead. Moreover, FastFI accurately identifies high-impact APIs and provides actionable guidance for call-site hardening.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14800v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LocBAM: Advancing 3D Patch-Based Image Segmentation by Integrating Location Contex</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14802</link><description>arXiv:2601.14802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patch-based methods are widely used in 3D medical image segmentation to address memory constraints in processing high-resolution volumetric data. However, these approaches often neglect the patch's location within the global volume, which can limit segmentation performance when anatomical context is important. In this paper, we investigate the role of location context in patch-based 3D segmentation and propose a novel attention mechanism, LocBAM, that explicitly processes spatial information. Experiments on BTCV, AMOS22, and KiTS23 demonstrate that incorporating location context stabilizes training and improves segmentation performance, particularly under low patch-to-volume coverage where global context is missing. Furthermore, LocBAM consistently outperforms classical coordinate encoding via CoordConv.

Abstract: Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) have emerged as a revolutionary architecture for next-generation wireless communications, offering wave-domain signal processing capabilities with significantly reduced hardware complexity compared to conventional systems. However, most existing SIM research assumes continuous phase shifts and perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which are impractical due to hardware discrete phase shift constraints and prohibitive pilot overhead. This paper presents a joint power allocation and discrete phase shift optimization framework for SIM-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output(MISO) downlink systems under statistical CSI. We formulate the achievable sum rate maximization problem considering practical discrete phase constraints and derive a closed-form expression for the average achievable rate under statistical CSI. To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we decouple the problem by using the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm and alternating optimization (AO). Subsequently, we utilize the Lagrangian multiplier method and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to obtain closed-form iterative solutions. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces computational complexity by a factor of 50 compared to semi-definite relaxation (SDR) methods, , while maintaining over 85% of the continuous phase shift performance with only 1-bit quantization, highlighting its feasibility for low-cost hardware systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14803v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry Informative and Agnostic Feature Disentanglement for 3D Shapes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14804</link><description>arXiv:2601.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape descriptors, i.e., per-vertex features of 3D meshes or point clouds, are fundamental to shape analysis. Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $\chi$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic. Further, we propose a feature refinement technique to improve the robustness of predicted symmetry informative features. Extensive experiments, including intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to various state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14804v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic Decision-Making Framework for Human-Robot Collaboration in Industrial Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14809</link><description>arXiv:2601.14809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative robots, or cobots, are increasingly integrated into various industrial and service settings to work efficiently and safely alongside humans. However, for effective human-robot collaboration, robots must reason based on human factors such as motivation level and aggression level. This paper proposes an approach for decision-making in human-robot collaborative (HRC) environments utilizing stochastic modeling. By leveraging probabilistic models and control strategies, the proposed method aims to anticipate human actions and emotions, enabling cobots to adapt their behavior accordingly. So far, most of the research has been done to detect the intentions of human co-workers. This paper discusses the theoretical framework, implementation strategies, simulation results, and potential applications of the bilateral collaboration approach for safety and efficiency in collaborative robotics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14809v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ICLF: An Immersive Code Learning Framework based on Git for Teaching and Evaluating Student Programming Projects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14814</link><description>arXiv:2601.14814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programming projects are essential in computer science education for bridging theory with practice and introducing students to tools like Git, IDEs, and debuggers. However, designing and evaluating these projects (especially in MOOCs)can be challenging. We propose the Immersive Code Learning Framework (ICLF), a scalable Git-based organizational pipeline for managing and evaluating student programming project. Students begin with an existing code base, a practice that is crucial for mirroring real-world software development. Students then iteratively complete tasks that pass predefined tests. The instructor only manages a hidden parent repository containing solutions, which is used to generate an intermediate public repository with these solutions removed via a templating system. Students are invited collaborators on private forks of this intermediate repository, possibly updated throughout the semester whenever the teacher changes the parent repository. This approach reduces grading platform dependency, supports automated feedback, and allows the project to evolve without disrupting student work. Successfully tested over several years, including in an edX MOOC, this organizational pipeline provides transparent evaluation, plagiarism detection, and continuous progress tracking for each student.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14814v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Statistical Learning Theory for Distributional Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14818</link><description>arXiv:2601.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In supervised learning with distributional inputs in the two-stage sampling setup, relevant to applications like learning-based medical screening or causal learning, the inputs (which are probability distributions) are not accessible in the learning phase, but only samples thereof. This problem is particularly amenable to kernel-based learning methods, where the distributions or samples are first embedded into a Hilbert space, often using kernel mean embeddings (KMEs), and then a standard kernel method like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is applied, using a kernel defined on the embedding Hilbert space. In this work, we contribute to the theoretical analysis of this latter approach, with a particular focus on classification with distributional inputs using SVMs. We establish a new oracle inequality and derive consistency and learning rate results. Furthermore, for SVMs using the hinge loss and Gaussian kernels, we formulate a novel variant of an established noise assumption from the binary classification literature, under which we can establish learning rates. Finally, some of our technical tools like a new feature space for Gaussian kernels on Hilbert spaces are of independent interest.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14818v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] POTR: Post-Training 3DGS Compression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14821</link><description>arXiv:2601.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising contender to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. 3DGS outperforms NeRF in training and inference speed but has substantially higher storage requirements. To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality. Finally, we extend POTR with a simple fine-tuning scheme to further enhance pruning, inference, and rate-distortion performance. Experiments demonstrate that POTR, even without fine-tuning, consistently outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in both rate-distortion performance and inference speed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14821v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal system for skin cancer detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14822</link><description>arXiv:2601.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melanoma detection is vital for early diagnosis and effective treatment. While deep learning models on dermoscopic images have shown promise, they require specialized equipment, limiting their use in broader clinical settings. This study introduces a multi-modal melanoma detection system using conventional photo images, making it more accessible and versatile. Our system integrates image data with tabular metadata, such as patient demographics and lesion characteristics, to improve detection accuracy. It employs a multi-modal neural network combining image and metadata processing and supports a two-step model for cases with or without metadata. A three-stage pipeline further refines predictions by boosting algorithms and enhancing performance. To address the challenges of a highly imbalanced dataset, specific techniques were implemented to ensure robust training. An ablation study evaluated recent vision architectures, boosting algorithms, and loss functions, achieving a peak Partial ROC AUC of 0.18068 (0.2 maximum) and top-15 retrieval sensitivity of 0.78371. Results demonstrate that integrating photo images with metadata in a structured, multi-stage pipeline yields significant performance improvements. This system advances melanoma detection by providing a scalable, equipment-independent solution suitable for diverse healthcare environments, bridging the gap between specialized and general clinical practices.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Archives, archival bond, and digital representation: A case study with the International Image Interoperability Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14823</link><description>arXiv:2601.14823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the archival sector, digitization has long been a strategic initiative to ensure greater availability of historical documents. In recent years, the promotion of guidelines and standards, combined with technological advancements, has established methodologies and best practices and developed tools to facilitate massive digitization projects. However, despite the availability of technological solutions and guidelines, digitization is intended mostly to scan documents and make the outcome images available online. This practice can be problematic in representing the complex fonds structure made of relations, the archival bond that establishes the natural ordering of documents into archival units. This is particularly relevant when the fonds also has a multimedia component, such as an audiovisual component, that is often reproduced on different platforms disconnected from textual documents. This article addresses the challenges linked to digitization in the archival sector and proposes a methodological framework for representing fonds with respect to their native organization. For this purpose, the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is employed to configure a specific model that respects the archive's hierarchical structure. In particular, this model is configured to maintain the archival bond and enhance the resource's semantic aspect to make the IIIF model semantically interoperable. To demonstrate the adaptability of the framework to the archival domain, in this work, the ''PCI-Unitelefilm'' fonds of the Fondazione Archivio Audiovisivo del Movimento Operaio e Democratico (AAMOD) served as the case study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14823v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Comparative Study of Large Language Models on Chinese Film Script Continuation: An Empirical Analysis Based on GPT-5.2 and Qwen-Max</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14826</link><description>arXiv:2601.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative writing, their performance on culturally specific narrative tasks warrants systematic investigation. This study constructs the first Chinese film script continuation benchmark comprising 53 classic films, and designs a multi-dimensional evaluation framework comparing GPT-5.2 and Qwen-Max-Latest. Using a "first half to second half" continuation paradigm with 3 samples per film, we obtained 303 valid samples (GPT-5.2: 157, 98.7% validity; Qwen-Max: 146, 91.8% validity). Evaluation integrates ROUGE-L, Structural Similarity, and LLM-as-Judge scoring (DeepSeek-Reasoner).
  Statistical analysis of 144 paired samples reveals: Qwen-Max achieves marginally higher ROUGE-L (0.2230 vs 0.2114, d=-0.43); however, GPT-5.2 significantly outperforms in structural preservation (0.93 vs 0.75, d=0.46), overall quality (44.79 vs 25.72, d=1.04), and composite scores (0.50 vs 0.39, d=0.84). The overall quality effect size reaches large effect level (d&gt;0.8).
  GPT-5.2 excels in character consistency, tone-style matching, and format preservation, while Qwen-Max shows deficiencies in generation stability. This study provides a reproducible framework for LLM evaluation in Chinese creative writing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14826v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Measuring and Aligning Abstraction in Vision-Language Models with Medical Taxonomies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14827</link><description>arXiv:2601.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models show strong zero-shot performance for chest X-ray classification, but standard flat metrics fail to distinguish between clinically minor and severe errors. This work investigates how to quantify and mitigate abstraction errors by leveraging medical taxonomies. We benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs using hierarchical metrics and introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors to capture cross-branch mistakes. Our results reveal substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance. To address this, we propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings, which reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2 per cent while maintaining competitive performance. These findings highlight the importance of hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment for safer and more clinically meaningful deployment of VLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Moving Beyond Compliance in Soft-Robotic Catheters Through Modularity for Precision Therapies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14837</link><description>arXiv:2601.14837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robotic instruments could navigate delicate, tortuous anatomy more safely than rigid tools, but clinical adoption is limited by insufficient tip functionalization and real-time feedback at the tissue interface. Few sensing and therapeutic modules are compact, robust, and adaptable enough to measure, and respond to, subtle physiological cues during intraluminal procedures. We present a 1.47 mm diameter modular soft robotic catheter that integrates sensing, actuation, and therapy while retaining the compliance needed for safe endoluminal navigation. Validated across multiple in vivo settings, we emphasize its utility in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a highly technical procedure and a key access route to the pancreas, an organ that is fragile, difficult to instrument, and central to diseases such as pancreatic cancer. Our architecture supports up to four independently controlled functional units, allowing customizable combinations of anchoring, manipulation, sensing, and targeted drug delivery. In a live porcine model, we demonstrate semi-autonomous deployment into the pancreatic duct and 7.5 cm of endoscopic navigation within it, a region currently inaccessible with standard catheters. A closed-loop autonomous/shared-control system that combines a learned model, magnetic actuation, onboard shape sensing, and visual marker tracking further improves cannulation accuracy. Together, these results establish a scalable platform for multifunctional soft robotic catheters and a new paradigm for complex endoluminal interventions, with potential to reduce radiation exposure, shorten training, and accelerate clinical translation of soft robotic technologies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14837v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Implementing Knowledge Representation and Reasoning with Object Oriented Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14840</link><description>arXiv:2601.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces KRROOD, a framework designed to bridge the integration gap between modern software engineering and Knowledge Representation &amp; Reasoning (KR&amp;amp;R) systems. While Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the standard for developing complex applications, existing KR&amp;amp;R frameworks often rely on external ontologies and specialized languages that are difficult to integrate with imperative code. KRROOD addresses this by treating knowledge as a first-class programming abstraction using native class structures, bridging the gap between the logic programming and OOP paradigms. We evaluate the system on the OWL2Bench benchmark and a human-robot task learning scenario. Experimental results show that KRROOD achieves strong performance while supporting the expressive reasoning required for real-world autonomous systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14840v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MTFlow: Time-Conditioned Flow Matching for Microtubule Segmentation in Noisy Microscopy Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14841</link><description>arXiv:2601.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that play essential roles in many cellular processes and are key therapeutic targets in several diseases. Accurate segmentation of microtubule networks is critical for studying their organization and dynamics but remains challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and image noise. We present MTFlow, a novel time-conditioned flow-matching model for microtubule segmentation. Unlike conventional U-Net variants that predict masks in a single pass, MTFlow learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward the ground truth, enabling interpretable, trajectory-based refinement. Our architecture combines a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings, allowing the model to capture the dynamics of uncertainty resolution along filament boundaries. We trained and evaluated MTFlow on synthetic and real microtubule datasets and assessed its generalization capability on public biomedical datasets of curvilinear structures such as retinal blood vessels and nerves. MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models, offering a powerful and time-efficient tool for filamentous structure analysis with more precise annotations than manual or semi-automatic approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14841v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Category-Theoretic Framework for Dependent Effect Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14846</link><description>arXiv:2601.14846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graded monads refine traditional monads using effect annotations in order to describe quantitatively the computational effects that a program can generate. They have been successfully applied to a variety of formal systems for reasoning about effectful computations. However, existing categorical frameworks for graded monads do not support effects that may depend on program values, which we call dependent effects, thereby limiting their expressiveness. We address this limitation by introducing indexed graded monads, a categorical generalization of graded monads inspired by the fibrational "indexed" view and by classical categorical semantics of dependent type theories. We show how indexed graded monads provide semantics for a refinement type system with dependent effects. We also show how this type system can be instantiated with specific choices of parameters to obtain several formal systems for reasoning about specific program properties. These instances include, in particular, cost analysis, probability-bound reasoning, expectation-bound reasoning, and temporal safety verification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14846v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Observation to Prediction: LSTM for Vehicle Lane Change Forecasting on Highway On/Off-Ramps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14848</link><description>arXiv:2601.14848v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Black-box variational inference (BBVI) with Gaussian mixture families offers a flexible approach for approximating complex posterior distributions without requiring gradients of the target density. However, standard numerical optimization methods often suffer from instability and inefficiency. We develop a stable and efficient framework that combines three key components: (1) affine-invariant preconditioning via natural gradient formulations, (2) an exponential integrator that unconditionally preserves the positive definiteness of covariance matrices, and (3) adaptive time stepping to ensure stability and to accommodate distinct warm-up and convergence phases. The proposed approach has natural connections to manifold optimization and mirror descent. For Gaussian posteriors, we prove exponential convergence in the noise-free setting and almost-sure convergence under Monte Carlo estimation, rigorously justifying the necessity of adaptive time stepping. Numerical experiments on multimodal distributions, Neal's multiscale funnel, and a PDE-based Bayesian inverse problem for Darcy flow demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14855v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HiNS: Hierarchical Negative Sampling for More Comprehensive Memory Retrieval Embedding Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14857</link><description>arXiv:2601.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory-augmented language agents rely on embedding models for effective memory retrieval. However, existing training data construction overlooks a critical limitation: the hierarchical difficulty of negative samples and their natural distribution in human-agent interactions. In practice, some negatives are semantically close distractors while others are trivially irrelevant, and natural dialogue exhibits structured proportions of these types. Current approaches using synthetic or uniformly sampled negatives fail to reflect this diversity, limiting embedding models' ability to learn nuanced discrimination essential for robust memory retrieval. In this work, we propose a principled data construction framework HiNS that explicitly models negative sample difficulty tiers and incorporates empirically grounded negative ratios derived from conversational data, enabling the training of embedding models with substantially improved retrieval fidelity and generalization in memory-intensive tasks. Experiments show significant improvements: on LoCoMo, F1/BLEU-1 gains of 3.27%/3.30%(MemoryOS) and 1.95%/1.78% (Mem0); on PERSONAMEM, total score improvements of 1.19% (MemoryOS) and 2.55% (Mem0).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14857v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Modal-Centric Field Inversion via Differentiable Proper Orthogonal Decomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14858</link><description>arXiv:2601.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems in computational physics often require matching high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields, leading to prohibitive computational costs and ill-conditioned optimizations. We introduce modal-centric field inversion (MCFI), a paradigm that reformulates inverse problems in the reduced space of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes rather than the full physical state space. By targeting dominant flow structures instead of point-wise field values, MCFI provides a compact, physically meaningful objective that naturally regularizes the inversion and dramatically reduces computational burden. Central to this framework is the differentiable POD: an adjoint-based method that efficiently computes sensitivities of POD modes with respect to model parameters, enabling gradient-based optimization in the modal space. We demonstrate MCFI on a one and two-dimensional modified viscous Burger's equation, optimizing spatially varying coefficients to match target dynamics through mode-matching. The adjoint formulation achieves computational cost independent of parameter dimension, in contrast to finite-difference approaches that scale linearly. MCFI establishes a foundation for scalable inverse design and model calibration in unsteady, high-dimensional systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14858v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Strategic Doctrine Language Models (sdLM): A Learning-System Framework for Doctrinal Consistency and Geopolitical Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14862</link><description>arXiv:2601.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Strategic Doctrine Language Models (sdLM), a learning-system framework for multi-document strategic reasoning with doctrinal consistency constraints and calibrated uncertainty. The approach combines multi-document attention, temporal encoding, and a doctrine-consistency layer to improve long-horizon forecasting and plan plausibility while reducing severe doctrinal violations. We evaluate sdLM using (i) expert-panel scoring of strategic scenarios (N=47), (ii) doctrine consistency on 336 doctrine publications (12,847 statements), and (iii) geopolitical forecasting on 127 historical counterfactuals (1945-2020) across 12-60 month horizons. Across these benchmarks, sdLM achieves higher strategic quality and better calibration than strong general-purpose LLM baselines, and remains competitive with human experts on long-horizon judgments. We further report ablations, scaling trends, and deployment-oriented performance/latency characteristics to clarify which components drive improvements and how they translate to operational settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14862v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Usefulness in Developer Explanations on Stack Overflow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14865</link><description>arXiv:2601.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explanations are essential in software engineering (SE) and requirements communication, helping stakeholders clarify ambiguities, justify design choices, and build shared understanding. Online Q&amp;amp;A forums such as Stack Overflow provide large-scale settings where such explanations are produced and evaluated, offering valuable insights into what makes them effective. While prior work has explored answer acceptance and voting behavior, little is known about which specific features make explanations genuinely useful. The relative influence of structural, contextual, and linguistic factors, such as content richness, timing, and sentiment, remains unclear. We analyzed 3,323 questions and 59,398 answers from Stack Overflow, combining text analysis and statistical modeling to examine how explanation attributes relate to perceived usefulness (normalized upvotes). Structural and contextual factors, especially explanation length, code inclusion, timing, and author reputation, show small to moderate positive effects. Sentiment polarity has negligible influence, suggesting that clarity and substance outweigh tone in technical communication. This study provides an empirical account of what drives perceived usefulness in developer explanations. It contributes methodological transparency through open data and replication materials, and conceptual insight by relating observed communication patterns to principles of requirements communication. The findings offer evidence-based implications for how developers and RE practitioners can craft clearer and more effective explanations, potentially supporting fairer communication in both open and organizational contexts. From an RE perspective, these determinants can be interpreted as practical signals for ambiguity reduction and rationale articulation in day-to-day requirements communication.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14865v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On-the-fly hand-eye calibration for the da Vinci surgical robot</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14871</link><description>arXiv:2601.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS), accurate tool localization is crucial to ensure patient safety and successful task execution. However, this remains challenging for cable-driven robots, such as the da Vinci robot, because erroneous encoder readings lead to pose estimation errors. In this study, we propose a calibration framework to produce accurate tool localization results through computing the hand-eye transformation matrix on-the-fly. The framework consists of two interrelated algorithms: the feature association block and the hand-eye calibration block, which provide robust correspondences for key points detected on monocular images without pre-training, and offer the versatility to accommodate various surgical scenarios by adopting an array of filter approaches, respectively. To validate its efficacy, we test the framework extensively on publicly available video datasets that feature multiple surgical instruments conducting tasks in both in vitro and ex vivo scenarios, under varying illumination conditions and with different levels of key point measurement accuracy. The results show a significant reduction in tool localization errors under the proposed calibration framework, with accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art methods while being more time-efficient.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14871v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HumanoidVLM: Vision-Language-Guided Impedance Control for Contact-Rich Humanoid Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14874</link><description>arXiv:2601.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid robots must adapt their contact behavior to diverse objects and tasks, yet most controllers rely on fixed, hand-tuned impedance gains and gripper settings. This paper introduces HumanoidVLM, a vision-language driven retrieval framework that enables the Unitree G1 humanoid to select task-appropriate Cartesian impedance parameters and gripper configurations directly from an egocentric RGB image. The system couples a vision-language model for semantic task inference with a FAISS-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves experimentally validated stiffness-damping pairs and object-specific grasp angles from two custom databases, and executes them through a task-space impedance controller for compliant manipulation. We evaluate HumanoidVLM on 14 visual scenarios and achieve a retrieval accuracy of 93%. Real-world experiments show stable interaction dynamics, with z-axis tracking errors typically within 1-3.5 cm and virtual forces consistent with task-dependent impedance settings. These results demonstrate the feasibility of linking semantic perception with retrieval-based control as an interpretable path toward adaptive humanoid manipulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14874v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GAT-NeRF: Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced Neural Radiance Fields for High-Fidelity 4D Facial Avatars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14875</link><description>arXiv:2601.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity 4D dynamic facial avatar reconstruction from monocular video is a critical yet challenging task, driven by increasing demands for immersive virtual human applications. While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars. Comprehensive experiments unequivocally demonstrate GAT-NeRF's state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, forging new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14875v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Contingency Planning for Safety-Critical Autonomous Vehicles: A Review and Perspectives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14880</link><description>arXiv:2601.14880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contingency planning is the architectural capability that enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to anticipate and mitigate discrete, high-impact hazards, such as sensor outages and adversarial interactions. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the field, synthesizing fragmented literature into a unified logic-conditioned hybrid control framework. Within this formalism, we categorize approaches into two distinct paradigms: Reactive Safety, which responds to realized hazards by enforcing safety constraints or executing fail-safe maneuvers; and Proactive Safety, which optimizes for future recourse by branching over potential modal transitions. In addition, we propose a fine-grained taxonomy that partitions the landscape into external contingencies (environmental and interactive hazards) and internal contingencies (system faults). Through a critical comparative analysis, we reveal a fundamental structural divergence: internal faults are predominantly addressed via reactive fail-safe mechanisms, whereas external interaction uncertainties increasingly require proactive branching strategies. Furthermore, we identify a critical methodological divergence: whereas physical hazards are typically managed with formal guarantees, semantic and out-of-distribution anomalies currently rely heavily on empirical validation. We conclude by identifying the open challenges in bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical validation, advocating for hybrid architectures and standardized benchmarking to transition contingency planning from formulation to certifiable real-world deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] 5G NR Non-Terrestrial Networks: Open Challenges for Full-Stack Protocol Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14883</link><description>arXiv:2601.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 5th generation (5G) networks continue to evolve, there is a growing interest toward the integration of Terrestrial Networks (TNs) and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs). Specifically, NTNs leverage space/air base stations such as satellites, High Altitude Platforms (HAPs), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for expanding wireless coverage to underserved rural/remote areas, supporting emergency communications, and offloading traffic in highly congested urban environments. In this paper we focus on the 3GPP 5G NR-NTN standard in the context of satellite communication networks, and highlight critical challenges that must be addressed for proper full-stack protocol design, with considerations related to the PHY, MAC, and higher layers. We also present simulation results in ns-3 to demonstrate the impact of some of these challenges on the network, as an initial step toward more advanced standardization activities on 3GPP 5G NR-NTN.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14883v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Makes Low-Bit Quantization-Aware Training Work for Reasoning LLMs? A Systematic Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14888</link><description>arXiv:2601.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning models excel at complex tasks such as coding and mathematics, yet their inference is often slow and token-inefficient. To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. For instance, on Qwen3-0.6B, it surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and consistently recovers performance in the 2-bit regime.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14888v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The CHI26 Workshop on the Future of Cognitive Personal Informatics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14891</link><description>arXiv:2601.14891v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Background: Neuro-symbolic methods enhance the reliability of neural network classifiers through logical constraints, but they lack native support for ontologies.
  Objectives: We aim to develop a neuro-symbolic method that reliably outputs predictions consistent with a Description Logic ontology that formalizes domain-specific knowledge.
  Methods: We encode a Description Logic ontology as a circuit, a feed-forward differentiable computational graph that supports tractable execution of queries and transformations. We show that the circuit can be used to (i) generate synthetic datasets that capture the semantics of the ontology; (ii) efficiently perform deductive reasoning on a GPU; (iii) implement neuro-symbolic models whose predictions are approximately or provably consistent with the knowledge defined in the ontology.
  Results We show that the synthetic dataset generated using the circuit qualitatively captures the semantics of the ontology while being challenging for Machine Learning classifiers, including neural networks. Moreover, we show that compiling the ontology into a circuit is a promising approach for scalable deductive reasoning, with runtimes up to three orders of magnitude faster than available reasoners. Finally, we show that our neuro-symbolic classifiers reliably produce consistent predictions when compared to neural network baselines, maintaining competitive performances or even outperforming them.
  Conclusions By compiling Description Logic ontologies into circuits, we obtain a tighter integration between the Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation fields. We show that a single circuit representation can be used to tackle different challenging tasks closely related to real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14894v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SpatialMem: Unified 3D Memory with Metric Anchoring and Fast Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14895</link><description>arXiv:2601.14895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SpatialMem, a memory-centric system that unifies 3D geometry, semantics, and language into a single, queryable representation. Starting from casually captured egocentric RGB video, SpatialMem reconstructs metrically scaled indoor environments, detects structural 3D anchors (walls, doors, windows) as the first-layer scaffold, and populates a hierarchical memory with open-vocabulary object nodes -- linking evidence patches, visual embeddings, and two-layer textual descriptions to 3D coordinates -- for compact storage and fast retrieval. This design enables interpretable reasoning over spatial relations (e.g., distance, direction, visibility) and supports downstream tasks such as language-guided navigation and object retrieval without specialized sensors. Experiments across three real-life indoor scenes demonstrate that SpatialMem maintains strong anchor-description-level navigation completion and hierarchical retrieval accuracy under increasing clutter and occlusion, offering an efficient and extensible framework for embodied spatial intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14895v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language-Coupled Reinforcement Learning for Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14896</link><description>arXiv:2601.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (MRAG) requires models to effectively acquire and integrate beneficial external knowledge from multilingual collections. However, most existing studies employ a unitive process where queries of equivalent semantics across different languages are processed through a single-turn retrieval and subsequent optimization. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy is often suboptimal in multilingual settings, as the models occur to knowledge bias and conflict during the interaction with the search engine. To alleviate the issues, we propose LcRL, a multilingual search-augmented reinforcement learning framework that integrates a language-coupled Group Relative Policy Optimization into the policy and reward models. We adopt the language-coupled group sampling in the rollout module to reduce knowledge bias, and regularize an auxiliary anti-consistency penalty in the reward models to mitigate the knowledge conflict. Experimental results demonstrate that LcRL not only achieves competitive performance but is also appropriate for various practical scenarios such as constrained training data and retrieval over collections encompassing a large number of languages. Our code is available at https://github.com/Cherry-qwq/LcRL-Open.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14896v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Just aware enough: Evaluating awareness across artificial systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14901</link><description>arXiv:2601.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent debates on artificial intelligence increasingly emphasise questions of AI consciousness and moral status, yet there remains little agreement on how such properties should be evaluated. In this paper, we argue that awareness offers a more productive and methodologically tractable alternative. We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14901v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PodBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Instruction-Aware Audio-Oriented Podcast Script Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14903</link><description>arXiv:2601.14903v1 Announce Type: new

To bridge this gap, we introduce PodBench, a benchmark comprising 800 samples with inputs up to 21K tokens and complex multi-speaker instructions. We propose a multifaceted evaluation framework that integrates quantitative constraints with LLM-based quality assessment. Extensive experiments reveal that while proprietary models generally excel, open-source models equipped with explicit reasoning demonstrate superior robustness in handling long contexts and multi-speaker coordination compared to standard baselines. However, our analysis uncovers a persistent divergence where high instruction following does not guarantee high content substance. PodBench offers a reproducible testbed to address these challenges in long-form, audio-centric generation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14903v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SynPerf: A Hybrid Analytical-ML Framework for GPU Performance Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14910</link><description>arXiv:2601.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Transformer-based large language models has dramatically increased the need for high-performance GPUs. As a result, there is growing demand for fast, accurate, and widely generalizable GPU performance models to support next-generation hardware selection and system-level exploration. However, current data-driven methods are limited, exhibiting poor generalization across hardware and inadequate modeling of complex production-level kernels common in modern inference stacks. To address these issues, we present SyncPerf, a unified GPU modeling framework. This approach first employs an analytical model to quantify a given kernel's demands on the GPU's heterogeneous instruction pipelines. These analytical features are then fed into a machine learning (ML) model to capture complex cross-pipeline interactions and resource dependencies, enabling high-fidelity performance prediction. Our evaluation across 11 GPU types from four generations of major architectures on two widely-used serving systems demonstrates that SyncPerf delivers high fidelity and strong generalizability. It achieves accurate predictions, with only 6.1% average error at the kernel level and 8.5% for end-to-end inference -- reducing the error of state-of-the-art methods by 6.7x and 4.4x, respectively. We also demonstrate SynPerf's value "beyond simulation" by utilizing its performance ceiling to diagnose implementation shortcomings and guide the optimization of a production fused MoE Triton kernel, achieving up to 1.7x speedup.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14910v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generalized preconditioned conjugate gradients for adaptive FEM with optimal complexity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14911</link><description>arXiv:2601.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider adaptive finite element methods (AFEMs) with inexact algebraic solver for second-order symmetric linear elliptic diffusion problems. We formulate and analyze a non-linear and non-symmetric geometric multigrid preconditioner for the generalized preconditioned conjugate gradient method (GPCG) used to solve the arising finite element systems. Moreover, a linear and symmetric variant of the geometric multigrid preconditioner that is suitable for the (standard) preconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG) is provided and analyzed. We show that both preconditioners are optimal in the sense that, first, the resulting algebraic solvers admit a contraction factor that is independent of the local mesh size h and the polynomial degree p, and, second, that they can be applied with linear computational complexity. Related to this, quasi-optimal computational cost of the overall adaptive finite element method is addressed. Numerical experiments underline the theoretical findings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14911v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AlertGuardian: Intelligent Alert Life-Cycle Management for Large-scale Cloud Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14912</link><description>arXiv:2601.14912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alerts are critical for detecting anomalies in large-scale cloud systems, ensuring reliability and user experience. However, current systems generate overwhelming volumes of alerts, degrading operational efficiency due to ineffective alert life-cycle management. This paper details the efforts of Company-X to optimize alert life-cycle management, addressing alert fatigue in cloud systems. We propose AlertGuardian, a framework collaborating large language models (LLMs) and lightweight graph models to optimize the alert life-cycle through three phases: Alert Denoise uses graph learning model with virtual noise to filter noise, Alert Summary employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to create actionable summary, and Alert Rule Refinement leverages multi-agent iterative feedbacks to improve alert rule quality. Evaluated on four real-world datasets from Company-X's services, AlertGuardian significantly mitigates alert fatigue (94.8\% alert reduction ratios) and accelerates fault diagnosis (90.5\% diagnosis accuracy). Moreover, AlertGuardian improves 1,174 alert rules, with 375 accepted by SREs (32% acceptance rate). Finally, we share success stories and lessons learned about alert life-cycle management after the deployment of AlertGuardian in Company-X.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14912v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CodeDelegator: Mitigating Context Pollution via Role Separation in Code-as-Action Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14914</link><description>arXiv:2601.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) allow agents to represent actions as executable code, offering greater expressivity than traditional tool-calling. However, real-world tasks often demand both strategic planning and detailed implementation. Using a single agent for both leads to context pollution from debugging traces and intermediate failures, impairing long-horizon performance. We propose CodeDelegator, a multi-agent framework that separates planning from implementation via role specialization. A persistent Delegator maintains strategic oversight by decomposing tasks, writing specifications, and monitoring progress without executing code. For each sub-task, a new Coder agent is instantiated with a clean context containing only its specification, shielding it from prior failures. To coordinate between agents, we introduce Ephemeral-Persistent State Separation (EPSS), which isolates each Coder's execution state while preserving global coherence, preventing debugging traces from polluting the Delegator's context. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeDelegator across diverse scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tailoring Adverse Event Prediction in Type 1 Diabetes with Patient-Specific Deep Learning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14917</link><description>arXiv:2601.14917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective management of Type 1 Diabetes requires continuous glucose monitoring and precise insulin adjustments to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. With the growing adoption of wearable glucose monitors and mobile health applications, accurate blood glucose prediction is essential for enhancing automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for personalized blood glucose prediction, leveraging patient-specific data to improve prediction accuracy and responsiveness in real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios. To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging. Our findings underscore the potential of adaptive, personalized glucose prediction models for advancing next-generation diabetes management, particularly in wearable and mobile health platforms, enhancing consumer-oriented diabetes care solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14917v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diagonals and algebraicity modulo $p$: a sharper degree bound</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14920</link><description>arXiv:2601.14920v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable multimodal reasoning for robotic perception and interaction, but their deployment in real-world systems remains constrained by latency, limited onboard resources, and privacy risks of cloud offloading. Edge intelligence within 6G, particularly Open RAN and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), offers a pathway to address these challenges by bringing computation closer to the data source. This work investigates the deployment of VLMs on ORAN/MEC infrastructure using the Unitree G1 humanoid robot as an embodied testbed. We design a WebRTC-based pipeline that streams multimodal data to an edge node and evaluate LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct deployed at the edge versus in the cloud under real-time conditions. Our results show that edge deployment preserves near-cloud accuracy while reducing end-to-end latency by 5\%. We further evaluate Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, a compact model optimized for resource-constrained environments, which achieves sub-second responsiveness, cutting latency by more than half but at the cost of accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14921v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Operationalising DAO Sustainability KPIs: A Multi-Chain Dashboard for Governance Analytics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14927</link><description>arXiv:2601.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DAO Portal, a production-grade analytics pipeline and interactive dashboard for assessing the sustainability of Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) derived from on-chain governance and token events. Building on our previous work, which defined and validated a multidimensional KPI framework for DAO sustainability, this paper moves from theory to practice by operationalising that framework in software infrastructure designed for finance and FinTech contexts. The system ingests governance and treasury data from major EVM networks, harmonises the outputs, and computes sustainability scores across four dimensions: participation, accumulated funds, voting efficiency, and decentralisation. A composite 0 to 12 score is then derived using transparent thresholds that are applied client-side in the browser.
  Using a curated snapshot of more than 50 active DAOs covering 6,930 proposals and 317,317 unique voting addresses, we show how the platform surfaces recurring patterns such as persistently low participation and concentration of proposal activity. These results demonstrate how DAO Portal supports the diagnosis of governance risks and the comparison of design choices across DAOs. To promote reproducibility and adoption, we release source code, data schema, and dashboard implementation. By turning governance traces into measurable and explainable KPIs, DAO Portal provides auditable evidence of DAO sustainability and contributes software engineering infrastructure for financial applications where treasuries and decision-making rights involve significant assets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14927v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative Artificial Intelligence, Musical Heritage and the Construction of Peace Narratives: A Case Study in Mali</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14931</link><description>arXiv:2601.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the capacity of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) to contribute to the construction of peace narratives and the revitalization of musical heritage in Mali. The study has been made in a political and social context where inter-community tensions and social fractures motivate a search for new symbolic frameworks for reconciliation. The study empirically explores three questions: (1) how Gen AI can be used as a tool for musical creation rooted in national languages and traditions; (2) to what extent Gen AI systems enable a balanced hybridization between technological innovation and cultural authenticity; and (3) how AI-assisted musical co-creation can strengthen social cohesion and cultural sovereignty. The experimental results suggest that Gen AI, embedded in a culturally conscious participatory framework, can act as a catalyst for symbolic diplomacy, amplifying local voices instead of standardizing them. However, challenges persist regarding the availability of linguistic corpora, algorithmic censorship, and the ethics of generating compositions derived from copyrighted sources.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14931v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-Based Repair of C++ Implicit Data Loss Compiler Warnings: An Industrial Case Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14936</link><description>arXiv:2601.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to automatically fix implicit data loss warnings in large C++ projects using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach uses the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to gather context, Tree-sitter to extract relevant code, and LLMs to make decisions and generate fixes. The method evaluates the necessity of range checks concerning performance implications and generates appropriate fixes. We tested this method in a large C++ project, resulting in a 92.73% acceptance rate of the fixes by human developers during the code review. Our LLM-generated fixes reduced the number of warning fix changes that introduced additional instructions due to range checks and exception handling by 39.09% compared to a baseline fix strategy. This result was 13.56% behind the optimal solutions created by human developers. These findings demonstrate that our LLM-based approach can reduce the manual effort to address compiler warnings while maintaining code quality and performance in a real-world scenario. Our automated approach shows promise for integration into existing development workflows, potentially improving code maintenance practices in complex C++ software projects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14936v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Communication-Efficient Multi-Modal Edge Inference via Uncertainty-Aware Distributed Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14942</link><description>arXiv:2601.14942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as a key enabler for distributed edge intelligence due to its capability to convey task-relevant meaning. However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14942v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] State of the Art of LLM-Enabled Interaction with Visualization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14943</link><description>arXiv:2601.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a systematic, PRISMA-guided survey of research at the intersection of LLMs and visualization, with a particular focus on visio-verbal interaction -- where verbal and visual modalities converge to support data sense-making. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced new paradigms for interacting with data visualizations through natural language, leading to intuitive, multimodal, and accessible interfaces. We analyze 48 papers across six dimensions: application domain, visualization task, visualization representation, interaction modality, LLM integration, and system evaluation. Our classification framework maps LLM roles across the visualization pipeline, from data querying and transformation to visualization generation, explanation, and navigation. We highlight emerging design patterns, identify gaps in accessibility and visualization reading, and discuss the limitations of current LLMs in spatial reasoning and contextual grounding. We further reflect on evaluations of combined LLM-visualization systems, highlighting how current research projects tackle this challenge and discuss current gaps in conducting meaningful evaluations of such systems. With our survey we aim to guide future research and system design in LLM-enhanced visualization, supporting broad audiences and intelligent, conversational interfaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The GDN-CC Dataset: Automatic Corpus Clarification for AI-enhanced Democratic Citizen Consultations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14944</link><description>arXiv:2601.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are ubiquitous in modern NLP, and while their applicability extends to texts produced for democratic activities such as online deliberations or large-scale citizen consultations, ethical questions have been raised for their usage as analysis tools. We continue this line of research with two main goals: (a) to develop resources that can help standardize citizen contributions in public forums at the pragmatic level, and make them easier to use in topic modeling and political analysis; (b) to study how well this standardization can reliably be performed by small, open-weights LLMs, i.e. models that can be run locally and transparently with limited resources. Accordingly, we introduce Corpus Clarification as a preprocessing framework for large-scale consultation data that transforms noisy, multi-topic contributions into structured, self-contained argumentative units ready for downstream analysis. We present GDN-CC, a manually-curated dataset of 1,231 contributions to the French Grand D\'ebat National, comprising 2,285 argumentative units annotated for argumentative structure and manually clarified. We then show that finetuned Small Language Models match or outperform LLMs on reproducing these annotations, and measure their usability for an opinion clustering task. We finally release GDN-CC-large, an automatically annotated corpus of 240k contributions, the largest annotated democratic consultation dataset to date.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14944v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TIDAL: Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop for High-Frequency VLA Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14945</link><description>arXiv:2601.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer semantic generalization but suffer from high inference latency, limiting them to low-frequency batch-and-execute paradigm. This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14945v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Should I Cite? A RAG Benchmark for Academic Citation Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14949</link><description>arXiv:2601.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of Web-based academic publications, more and more papers are being published annually, making it increasingly difficult to find relevant prior work. Citation prediction aims to automatically suggest appropriate references, helping scholars navigate the expanding scientific literature. Here we present \textbf{CiteRAG}, the first comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-integrated benchmark for evaluating large language models on academic citation prediction, featuring a multi-level retrieval strategy, specialized retrievers, and generators. Our benchmark makes four core contributions: (1) We establish two instances of the citation prediction task with different granularity. Task 1 focuses on coarse-grained list-specific citation prediction, while Task 2 targets fine-grained position-specific citation prediction. To enhance these two tasks, we build a dataset containing 7,267 instances for Task 1 and 8,541 instances for Task 2, enabling comprehensive evaluation of both retrieval and generation. (2) We construct a three-level large-scale corpus with 554k papers spanning many major subfields, using an incremental pipeline. (3) We propose a multi-level hybrid RAG approach for citation prediction, fine-tuning embedding models with contrastive learning to capture complex citation relationships, paired with specialized generation models. (4) We conduct extensive experiments across state-of-the-art language models, including closed-source APIs, open-source models, and our fine-tuned generators, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework. Our open-source toolkit enables reproducible evaluation and focuses on academic literature, providing the first comprehensive evaluation framework for citation prediction and serving as a methodological template for other scientific domains.

Abstract: Existing segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks.To improve robustness, adversarial training incorporates adversarial examples into model training. However, existing attack methods consider only global semantic information and ignore contextual semantic relationships within the samples, limiting the effectiveness of adversarial training. To address this issue, we propose EroSeg-AT, a vulnerability-aware adversarial training framework that leverages EroSeg to generate adversarial examples. EroSeg first selects sensitive pixels based on pixel-level confidence and then progressively propagates perturbations to higher-confidence pixels, effectively disrupting the semantic consistency of the samples. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our approach significantly improves attack effectiveness and enhances model robustness under adversarial training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14950v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TempViz: On the Evaluation of Temporal Knowledge in Text-to-Image Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14951</link><description>arXiv:2601.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time alters the visual appearance of entities in our world, like objects, places, and animals. Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14951v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CorpusQA: A 10 Million Token Benchmark for Corpus-Level Analysis and Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14952</link><description>arXiv:2601.14952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models now handle million-token contexts, their capacity for reasoning across entire document repositories remains largely untested. Existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they are mostly limited to single long texts or rely on a "sparse retrieval" assumption-that answers can be derived from a few relevant chunks. This assumption fails for true corpus-level analysis, where evidence is highly dispersed across hundreds of documents and answers require global integration, comparison, and statistical aggregation. To address this critical gap, we introduce CorpusQA, a new benchmark scaling up to 10 million tokens, generated via a novel data synthesis framework. By decoupling reasoning from textual representation, this framework creates complex, computation-intensive queries with programmatically guaranteed ground-truth answers, challenging systems to perform holistic reasoning over vast, unstructured text without relying on fallible human annotation. We further demonstrate the utility of our framework beyond evaluation, showing that fine-tuning on our synthesized data effectively enhances an LLM's general long-context reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art long-context LLMs struggle as input length increases, and standard retrieval-augmented generation systems collapse entirely. Our findings indicate that memory-augmented agentic architectures offer a more robust alternative, suggesting a critical shift is needed from simply extending context windows to developing advanced architectures for global information synthesis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14952v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Rumor Detection Enhanced by External Evidence and Forgery Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14954</link><description>arXiv:2601.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media increasingly disseminates information through mixed image text posts, but rumors often exploit subtle inconsistencies and forged content, making detection based solely on post content difficult. Deep semantic mismatch rumors, which superficially align images and texts, pose particular challenges and threaten online public opinion. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods improve cross modal modeling but suffer from limited feature extraction, noisy alignment, and inflexible fusion strategies, while ignoring external factual evidence necessary for verifying complex rumors. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model enhanced with external evidence and forgery features. The model uses a ResNet34 visual encoder, a BERT text encoder, and a forgery feature module extracting frequency-domain traces and compression artifacts via Fourier transformation. BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces. A dual contrastive learning module computes contrastive losses between text image and text description pairs, improving detection of semantic inconsistencies. A gated adaptive feature-scaling fusion mechanism dynamically adjusts multimodal fusion and reduces redundancy. Experiments on Weibo and Twitter datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms mainstream baselines in macro accuracy, recall, and F1 score.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14954v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Behavior Sequential Modeling with Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network for E-Commerce Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14955</link><description>arXiv:2601.14955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User interactions on e-commerce platforms are inherently diverse, involving behaviors such as clicking, favoriting, adding to cart, and purchasing. The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for understanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi-behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional transformers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behavior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, TGA has been deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, where it leads to impressive improvements in key business metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14955v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Regret Approximation for Unsupervised Dynamic Environment Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14957</link><description>arXiv:2601.14957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) seeks to automatically generate training curricula for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, with the goal of improving generalisation and zero-shot performance. However, designing effective curricula remains a difficult problem, particularly in settings where small subsets of environment parameterisations result in significant increases in the complexity of the required policy. Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes. We also introduce a new regret approximation, Maximised Negative Advantage (MNA), as a significantly improved metric to optimise for, that better identifies more challenging levels. We show empirically that MNA outperforms current regret approximations and when combined with DEGen, consistently outperforms existing methods, especially as the size of the environment grows. We have made all our code available here: https://github.com/HarryMJMead/Dynamic-Environment-Generation-for-UED.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14957v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Comprehensive Benchmark of Language Models on Unicode and Romanized Sinhala</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14958</link><description>arXiv:2601.14958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Language Models (LMs) on lower-resource, morphologically rich languages like Sinhala remains under-explored, particularly for Romanized Sinhala, which is prevalent in digital communication. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of modern LMs on a diverse corpus of Unicode and Romanized Sinhala. We evaluate open-source models using perplexity, a measure of how well a model predicts a text, and leading closed-source models via a qualitative analysis of sentence completion. Our findings reveal that the Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407 model achieves the strongest predictive performance on Unicode text and the Mistral-7B-v0.3 model for Romanized text. The results also highlight the strong all-around performance of the Llama-3.1-8B model for both scripts. Furthermore, a significant performance disparity exists among closed-source models: Gemini-1.5-pro and DeepSeek excel at Unicode generation, whereas Claude-3.5-Sonnet is superior at handling Romanized text. These results provide an essential guide for practitioners selecting models for Sinhala-specific applications and highlight the critical role of training data in handling script variations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14958v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Holistic Modeling for Video Frame Interpolation with Auto-regressive Diffusion Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14959</link><description>arXiv:2601.14959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing video frame interpolation (VFI) methods often adopt a frame-centric approach, processing videos as independent short segments (e.g., triplets), which leads to temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{F}orcing for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{F}rame \textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

Abstract: Material Fingerprinting is a lookup table-based strategy to discover material models from experimental measurements, which completely avoids the need to solve an optimization problem. In an offline phase, a comprehensive database of simulated material responses, so-called material fingerprints, is generated for a predefined experimental setup. This database can then be used repeatedly in the online phase to discover material models corresponding to experimentally measured observations. To this end, the experimentally measured fingerprint is compared with all fingerprints in the database to identify the closest match. The primary advantage of this strategy is that it does not require solving a continuous optimization problem. This avoids the associated computational costs as well as issues of ill-posedness caused by local minima in non-convex optimization landscapes. Material Fingerprinting has been successfully demonstrated for supervised datasets consisting of stress-strain pairs, as well as for unsupervised datasets involving full-field displacements and net reaction forces. However, to date, there is no experimental validation for the latter approach which is the objective of this work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14965v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] InstructTime++: Time Series Classification with Multimodal Language Modeling via Implicit Feature Enhancement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14968</link><description>arXiv:2601.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing time series classification methods adopt a discriminative paradigm that maps input sequences directly to one-hot encoded class labels. While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of InstructTime++.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14968v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fine-Grained Traceability for Transparent ML Pipelines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14971</link><description>arXiv:2601.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning systems are increasingly realised as multistage pipelines, yet existing transparency mechanisms typically operate at a model level: they describe what a system is and why it behaves as it does, but not how individual data samples are operationally recorded, tracked, and verified as they traverse the pipeline. This absence of verifiable, sample-level traceability leaves practitioners and users unable to determine whether a specific sample was used, when it was processed, or whether the corresponding records remain intact over time. We introduce FG-Trac, a model-agnostic framework that establishes verifiable, fine-grained sample-level traceability throughout machine learning pipelines. FG-Trac defines an explicit mechanism for capturing and verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, computes contribution scores explicitly grounded in training checkpoints, and anchors these traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. The framework integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives, reconstructing complete and auditable data-usage histories with practical computational overhead. Experiments on a canonical convolutional neural network and a multimodal graph learning pipeline demonstrate that FG-Trac preserves predictive performance while enabling machine learning systems to furnish verifiable evidence of how individual samples were used and propagated during model execution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14971v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HumanDiffusion: A Vision-Based Diffusion Trajectory Planner with Human-Conditioned Goals for Search and Rescue UAV</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14973</link><description>arXiv:2601.14973v1 Announce Type: new

Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14973v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fractional Diffusion on Graphs: Superposition of Laplacian Semigroups and Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14977</link><description>arXiv:2601.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subdiffusion on graphs is often modeled by time-fractional diffusion equations, yet its structural and dynamical consequences remain unclear. We show that subdiffusive transport on graphs is a memory-driven process generated by a random time change that compresses operational time, produces long-tailed waiting times, and breaks Markovianity while preserving linearity and mass conservation. We prove that Mittag-Leffler graph dynamics admit an exact convex, mass-preserving representation as a superposition of classical heat semigroups evaluated at rescaled times, revealing fractional diffusion as ordinary diffusion acting across multiple intrinsic time scales. This framework uncovers heterogeneous, vertex-dependent memory effects and induces transport biases absent in classical diffusion, including algebraic relaxation, degree-dependent waiting times, and early-time asymmetries between sources and neighbors. These features define a subdiffusive geometry on graphs enabling particles to locally discover global shortest paths while favoring high-degree regions. Finally, we show that time-fractional diffusion arises as a singular limit of multi-rate diffusion.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14977v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unified Multi-Dataset Training for TBPS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14978</link><description>arXiv:2601.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) has seen significant progress with vision-language models (VLMs), yet it remains constrained by limited training data and the fact that VLMs are not inherently pre-trained for pedestrian-centric recognition. Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 demonstrate that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14978v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parallel Collaborative ADMM Privacy Computing and Adaptive GPU Acceleration for Distributed Edge Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14980</link><description>arXiv:2601.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed computing has been widely applied in distributed edge networks for reducing the processing burden of high-dimensional data centralization, where a high-dimensional computational task is decomposed into multiple low-dimensional collaborative processing tasks or multiple edge nodes use distributed data to train a global model. However, the computing power of a single-edge node is limited, and collaborative computing will cause information leakage and excessive communication overhead. In this paper, we design a parallel collaborative distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and propose a three-phase parallel collaborative ADMM privacy computing (3P-ADMM-PC2) algorithm for distributed computing in edge networks, where the Paillier homomorphic encryption is utilized to protect data privacy during interactions. Especially, a quantization method is introduced, which maps the real numbers to a positive integer interval without affecting the homomorphic operations. To address the architectural mismatch between large-integer and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing, we transform high-bitwidth computations into low-bitwidth matrix and vector operations. Thus the GPU can be utilized to implement parallel encryption and decryption computations with long keys. Finally, a GPU-accelerated 3P-ADMM-PC2 is proposed to optimize the collaborative computing tasks. Meanwhile, large-scale computational tasks are conducted in network topologies with varying numbers of edge nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3P-ADMM-PC2 has excellent mean square error performance, which is close to that of distributed ADMM without privacy-preserving. Compared to centralized ADMM and distributed ADMM implemented with Central Processing Unit (CPU) computation, the proposed scheme demonstrates a significant speedup ratio.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14980v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interoperable Architecture for Digital Identity Delegation for AI Agents with Blockchain Integration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14982</link><description>arXiv:2601.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifiable delegation in digital identity systems remains unresolved across centralized, federated, and self-sovereign identity (SSI) environments, particularly where both human users and autonomous AI agents must exercise and transfer authority without exposing primary credentials or private keys. We introduce a unified framework that enables bounded, auditable, and least-privilege delegation across heterogeneous identity ecosystems. The framework includes four key elements: Delegation Grants (DGs), first-class authorization artefacts that encode revocable transfers of authority with enforced scope reduction; a Canonical Verification Context (CVC) that normalizes verification requests into a single structured representation independent of protocols or credential formats; a layered reference architecture that separates trust anchoring, credential and proof validation, policy evaluation, and protocol mediation via a Trust Gateway; and an explicit treatment of blockchain anchoring as an optional integrity layer rather than a structural dependency. Together, these elements advance interoperable delegation and auditability and provide a foundation for future standardization, implementation, and integration of autonomous agents into trusted digital identity infrastructures.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14982v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stealthy bias injection attack detection based on Kullback-Leibler divergence in stochastic linear systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14984</link><description>arXiv:2601.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the design of detection observers against stealthy bias injection attacks in stochastic linear systems under Gaussian noise, considering adversaries that exploit noise and inject crafted bias signals into a subset of sensors in a slow and coordinated manner, thereby achieving malicious objectives while remaining stealthy. To address such attacks, we formulate the observer design as a max-min optimization problem to enhance the detectability of worst-case BIAs, which attain a prescribed attack impact with the least detectability evaluated via Kullback-Leibler divergence. To reduce the computational complexity of the derived non-convex design problem, we consider the detectability of worst-case BIAs at three specific time instants: attack onset, one step after attack occurrence, and the steady state. We prove that the Kalman filter is optimal for maximizing the BIA detectability at the attack onset, regardless of the subset of attacked sensors. For the one-step and steady-state cases, the observer design problems are approximated by bi-convex optimization problems, which can be efficiently solved using alternating optimization and alternating direction method of multipliers. Moreover, more tractable linear matrix inequality relaxations are developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed stealth-aware detection framework is demonstrated through an application to a thermal system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14984v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Random Gilbert-Varshamov Codes for Joint Source-Channel Coding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14987</link><description>arXiv:2601.14987v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Data contamination undermines the validity of Large Language Model evaluation by enabling models to rely on memorized benchmark content rather than true generalization. While prior work has proposed contamination detection methods, these approaches are largely limited to English benchmarks, leaving multilingual contamination poorly understood. In this work, we investigate contamination dynamics in multilingual settings by fine-tuning several open-weight LLMs on varying proportions of Arabic datasets and evaluating them on original English benchmarks. To detect memorization, we extend the Tested Slot Guessing method with a choice-reordering strategy and incorporate Min-K% probability analysis, capturing both behavioral and distributional contamination signals.
  Our results show that translation into Arabic suppresses conventional contamination indicators, yet models still benefit from exposure to contaminated data, particularly those with stronger Arabic capabilities. This effect is consistently reflected in rising Mink% scores and increased cross-lingual answer consistency as contamination levels grow. To address this blind spot, we propose Translation-Aware Contamination Detection, which identifies contamination by comparing signals across multiple translated benchmark variants rather than English alone. The Translation-Aware Contamination Detection reliably exposes contamination even when English-only methods fail. Together, our findings highlight the need for multilingual, translation-aware evaluation pipelines to ensure fair, transparent, and reproducible assessment of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14994v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Effectiveness of Mempool-based Transaction Auditing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14996</link><description>arXiv:2601.14996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the literature features a number of proposals to defend against transaction manipulation attacks, existing proposals are still not integrated within large blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. Instead, the user community opted to rely on more practical but ad-hoc solutions (such as Mempool.space) that aim at detecting censorship and transaction displacement attacks by auditing discrepancies in the mempools of so-called observers.
  In this paper, we precisely analyze, for the first time, the interplay between mempool auditing and the ability to detect censorship and transaction displacement attacks by malicious miners in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our analysis shows that mempool auditing can result in mis-accusations against miners with a probability larger than 25% in some settings. On a positive note, however, we show that mempool auditing schemes can successfully audit the execution of any two transactions (with an overwhelming probability of 99.9%) if they are consistently received by all observers and sent at least 30 seconds apart from each other. As a direct consequence, our findings show, for the first time, that batch-order fair-ordering schemes can offer only strong fairness guarantees for a limited subset of transactions in real-world deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14996v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph-Based Adaptive Planning for Coordinated Dual-Arm Robotic Disassembly of Electronic Devices (eGRAP)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14998</link><description>arXiv:2601.14998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-waste is growing rapidly while recycling rates remain low. We propose an electronic-device Graph-based Adaptive Planning (eGRAP) that integrates vision, dynamic planning, and dual-arm execution for autonomous disassembly. A camera-equipped arm identifies parts and estimates their poses, and a directed graph encodes which parts must be removed first. A scheduler uses topological ordering of this graph to select valid next steps and assign them to two robot arms, allowing independent tasks to run in parallel. One arm carries a screwdriver (with an eye-in-hand depth camera) and the other holds or handles components. We demonstrate eGRAP on 3.5in hard drives: as parts are unscrewed and removed, the system updates its graph and plan online. Experiments show consistent full disassembly of each HDD, with high success rates and efficient cycle times, illustrating the method's ability to adaptively coordinate dual-arm tasks in real time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14998v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lineup Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus (L-RAPM): Basketball Lineup Ratings with Informed Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15000</link><description>arXiv:2601.15000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying combinations of players (that is, lineups) in basketball - and other sports - that perform well when they play together is one of the most important tasks in sports analytics. One of the main challenges associated with this task is the frequent substitutions that occur during a game, which results in highly sparse data. In particular, a National Basketball Association (NBA) team will use more than 600 lineups during a season, which translates to an average lineup having seen the court in approximately 25-30 possessions. Inevitably, any statistics that one collects for these lineups are going to be noisy, with low predictive value. Yet, there is no existing work (in the public at least) that addresses this problem. In this work, we propose a regression-based approach that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup, while it also utilizes information about the players making up the lineups. Our experiments show that L-RAPM provides improved predictive power than the currently used baseline, and this improvement increases as the sample size for the lineups gets smaller.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15000v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RadixMLP -- Intra-batch Deduplication for Causal Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15013</link><description>arXiv:2601.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch inference workloads for causal transformer models frequently process sequences that share common prefixes, such as system prompts, few-shot examples, or shared queries. Standard inference engines treat each sequence independently, redundantly recomputing identical MLP activations for every copy of the shared prefix. We introduce RadixMLP, a technique that exploits the position-wise nature of MLPs, LayerNorms, linear projections, and embeddings to eliminate this redundancy. RadixMLP dynamically maps batches to a prefix trie, gathering shared segments into a compressed representation for position-wise computation and scattering results back only at attention boundaries. RadixMLP is stateless and operates within a single forward pass. In end-to-end serving benchmarks on MS~MARCO v1.1 with Qwen3 models (0.6B to 8B parameters), RadixMLP achieves 1.44-1.59$\times$ speedups in realistic reranking workloads, with up to $5\times$ speedups on synthetic benchmarks with longer shared prefixes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in active flow control (AFC), yet progress in the field remains difficult to assess as existing studies rely on heterogeneous observation and actuation schemes, numerical setups, and evaluation protocols. Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in a single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols. We present baseline results with PPO and SAC and release all environments, datasets, and trained models as public resources. FluidGym enables systematic comparison of control methods, establishes a scalable foundation for future research in learning-based flow control, and is available at https://github.com/safe-autonomous-systems/fluidgym.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15015v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LiViBench: An Omnimodal Benchmark for Interactive Livestream Video Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15016</link><description>arXiv:2601.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has advanced general video understanding. However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15016v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SpatialV2A: Visual-Guided High-fidelity Spatial Audio Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15017</link><description>arXiv:2601.15017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While video-to-audio generation has achieved remarkable progress in semantic and temporal alignment, most existing studies focus solely on these aspects, paying limited attention to the spatial perception and immersive quality of the synthesized audio. This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency. All datasets, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15017v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Risk Estimation for Automated Driving</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15018</link><description>arXiv:2601.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety is a central requirement for automated vehicles. As such, the assessment of risk in automated driving is key in supporting both motion planning technologies and safety evaluation. In automated driving, risk is characterized by two aspects. The first aspect is the uncertainty on the state estimates of other road participants by an automated vehicle. The second aspect is the severity of a collision event with said traffic participants. Here, the uncertainty aspect typically causes the risk to be non-zero for near-collision events. This makes risk particularly useful for automated vehicle motion planning. Namely, constraining or minimizing risk naturally navigates the automated vehicle around traffic participants while keeping a safety distance based on the level of uncertainty and the potential severity of the impending collision. Existing approaches to calculate the risk either resort to empirical modeling or severe approximations, and, hence, lack generalizability and accuracy. In this paper, we combine recent advances in collision probability estimation with the concept of collision severity to develop a general method for accurate risk estimation. The proposed method allows us to assign individual severity functions for different collision constellations, such as, e.g., frontal or side collisions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, which is beneficial, e.g., in real-time motion planning applications. The programming code for an exemplary implementation of Gaussian uncertainties is also provided.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mixture-of-Experts Models in Vision: Routing, Optimization, and Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15021</link><description>arXiv:2601.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enable conditional computation by routing inputs to multiple expert subnetworks and are often motivated as a mechanism for scaling large language models. In this project, we instead study MoE behavior in an image classification setting, focusing on predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization. We compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on the CIFAR10 dataset under comparable model capacity. Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15021v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ExPrIS: Knowledge-Level Expectations as Priors for Object Interpretation from Sensor Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15025</link><description>arXiv:2601.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning has significantly advanced robotic object recognition, purely data-driven approaches often lack semantic consistency and fail to leverage valuable, pre-existing knowledge about the environment. This report presents the ExPrIS project, which addresses this challenge by investigating how knowledge-level expectations can serve as to improve object interpretation from sensor data. Our approach is based on the incremental construction of a 3D Semantic Scene Graph (3DSSG). We integrate expectations from two sources: contextual priors from past observations and semantic knowledge from external graphs like ConceptNet. These are embedded into a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to create an expectation-biased inference process. This method moves beyond static, frame-by-frame analysis to enhance the robustness and consistency of scene understanding over time. The report details this architecture, its evaluation, and outlines its planned integration on a mobile robotic platform.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15025v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Information mechanics: conservation and exchange</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15028</link><description>arXiv:2601.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference and learning are commonly cast in terms of optimisation, yet the fundamental constraints governing uncertainty reduction remain unclear. This work presents a first-principles framework inherent to Bayesian updating, termed information mechanics (infomechanics). Any pointwise reduction in posterior surprisal is exactly balanced by information gained from data, independently of algorithms, dynamics, or implementation. Imposing additivity, symmetry, and robustness collapses the freedom of this identity to only two independent conservation relations. One governs the global redistribution of uncertainty and recovers Shannon entropy. The other captures a complementary local geometric component, formalised as Fisher information. Together, these conserved quantities motivate a non-additive state function, the information potential $\Phi$, which isolates structural degrees of freedom beyond entropy while remaining invariant under reparametrisation. $\Phi$ quantifies local sharpness and ruggedness in posterior beliefs and vanishes uniquely for isotropic Gaussian distributions. In a low-temperature regime, $\Phi$ scales logarithmically with the effective number of local optima, linking information geometry to computational complexity. This formalises an information-computation exchange, whereby information acquisition reshapes the inference landscape and reduces computational demands. By separating invariant informational constraints from inference mechanisms, this framework provides a unified, algorithm-independent foundation for inference, learning, and computation across biological and artificial systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15028v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emergent, not Immanent: A Baradian Reading of Explainable AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15029</link><description>arXiv:2601.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is frequently positioned as a technical problem of revealing the inner workings of an AI model. This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods. We then articulate the framework's ethical dimension and propose design directions for XAI interfaces that support emergent interpretation, using a speculative text-to-music interface as a case study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15029v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Visual and Cognitive Demands of a Large Language Model-Powered In-vehicle Conversational Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15034</link><description>arXiv:2601.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driver distraction remains a leading contributor to motor vehicle crashes, necessitating rigorous evaluation of new in-vehicle technologies. This study assessed the visual and cognitive demands associated with an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) conversational agent (Gemini Live) during on-road driving, comparing it against handsfree phone calls, visual turn-by-turn guidance (low load baseline), and the Operation Span (OSPAN) task (high load anchor). Thirty-two licensed drivers completed five secondary tasks while visual and cognitive demands were measured using the Detection Response Task (DRT) for cognitive load, eye-tracking for visual attention, and subjective workload ratings. Results indicated that Gemini Live interactions (both single-turn and multi-turn) and hands-free phone calls shared similar levels of cognitive load, between that of visual turn-by-turn guidance and OSPAN. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive load remained stable across extended multi-turn conversations. All tasks maintained mean glance durations well below the well-established 2-second safety threshold, confirming low visual demand. Furthermore, drivers consistently dedicated longer glances to the roadway between brief off-road glances toward the device during task completion, particularly during voice-based interactions, rendering longer total-eyes-off-road time findings less consequential. Subjective ratings mirrored objective data, with participants reporting low effort, demands, and perceived distraction for Gemini Live. These findings demonstrate that advanced LLM conversational agents, when implemented via voice interfaces, impose cognitive and visual demands comparable to established, low-risk hands-free benchmarks, supporting their safe deployment in the driving environment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15034v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Factorizable joint shift revisited</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15036</link><description>arXiv:2601.15036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factorizable joint shift (FJS) was proposed as a type of distribution shift (or dataset shift) that comprises both covariate and label shift. Recently, it has been observed that FJS actually arises from consecutive label and covariate (or vice versa) shifts. Research into FJS so far has been confined to the case of categorical label spaces. We propose a framework for analysing distribution shift in the case of general label spaces, thus covering both classification and regression models. Based on the framework, we generalise existing results on FJS to general label spaces and propose a related extension of the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm for class prior probabilities. We also take a fresh look at generalized label shift (GLS) in the case of general label spaces.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15036v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowledge Restoration-driven Prompt Optimization: Unlocking LLM Potential for Open-Domain Relational Triplet Extraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15037</link><description>arXiv:2601.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-domain Relational Triplet Extraction (ORTE) is the foundation for mining structured knowledge without predefined schemas. Despite the impressive in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing methods are hindered by their reliance on static, heuristic-driven prompting strategies. Due to the lack of reflection mechanisms required to internalize erroneous signals, these methods exhibit vulnerability in semantic ambiguity, often making erroneous extraction patterns permanent. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Knowledge Reconstruction-driven Prompt Optimization (KRPO) framework to assist LLMs in continuously improving their extraction capabilities for complex ORTE task flows. Specifically, we design a self-evaluation mechanism based on knowledge restoration, which provides intrinsic feedback signals by projecting structured triplets into semantic consistency scores. Subsequently, we propose a prompt optimizer based on a textual gradient that can internalize historical experiences to iteratively optimize prompts, which can better guide LLMs to handle subsequent extraction tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate relation redundancy, we design a relation canonicalization memory that collects representative relations and provides semantically distinct schemas for the triplets. Extensive experiments across three datasets show that KRPO significantly outperforms strong baselines in the extraction F1 score.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Curriculum-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15038</link><description>arXiv:2601.15038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric vehicle routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW) is a complex optimization problem in sustainable logistics, where routing decisions must minimize total travel distance, fleet size, and battery usage while satisfying strict customer time constraints. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15038v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CADGrasp: Learning Contact and Collision Aware General Dexterous Grasping in Cluttered Scenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15039</link><description>arXiv:2601.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous grasping in cluttered environments presents substantial challenges due to the high degrees of freedom of dexterous hands, occlusion, and potential collisions arising from diverse object geometries and complex layouts. To address these challenges, we propose CADGrasp, a two-stage algorithm for general dexterous grasping using single-view point cloud inputs. In the first stage, we predict sparse IBS, a scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation, as the optimization target. Sparse IBS compactly encodes the geometric and contact relationships between the dexterous hand and the scene, enabling stable and collision-free dexterous grasp pose optimization. To enhance the prediction of this high-dimensional representation, we introduce an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure score filtering. In the second stage, we develop several energy functions and ranking strategies for optimization based on sparse IBS to generate high-quality dexterous grasp poses. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its capability to mitigate collisions while maintaining a high grasp success rate across diverse objects and complex scenes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15039v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Electrical Design of a Clean Offshore Heat and Power (CleanOFF) Hub</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15040</link><description>arXiv:2601.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative offshore solution where oil &amp; gas platform clusters are powered by a wind farm and a hydrogen hub. The results show a feasible off-grid design as an alternative to conventional electrification solutions. To address the challenges of design and operation of such a system, a power system model of the equipment and control was developed in a power system simulator called Process Power Simulator (PPSim). Power fluctuations in the wind farm are modelled using a state-of-the-art method encompassing turbulence and wakes. Various operation scenarios were used to evaluate the system design and find the right equipment size. An expensive component to over dimension is the battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS power rating and energy capacity were found by running a combination of scenarios with extreme and natural wind variations, and contingencies. The control strategy and ramp rates of electrolyzers have significant impact on both system performance and design. A ramp rate in the order of seconds as opposed to minutes will decrease the required BESS size by 60-70%. Choosing synchronized control of the electrolyzers can further reduce the BESS size by 15-20%. The simulations also revealed challenges to achieve self-sufficiency of hydrogen and potential design improvements are suggested.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15040v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HyperNet-Adaptation for Diffusion-Based Test Case Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15041</link><description>arXiv:2601.15041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15041v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Transformer-GNN for Privacy-Preserving Brain Tumor Localization with Modality-Level Explainability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15042</link><description>arXiv:2601.15042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for brain tumor analysis require large and diverse datasets that are often siloed across healthcare institutions due to privacy regulations. We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p&lt;0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15042v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Game-Theoretic Lens on LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15047</link><description>arXiv:2601.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning, planning, and communication abilities, enabling them to operate as autonomous agents in open environments. While single-agent systems remain limited in adaptability and coordination, recent progress has shifted attention toward multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of interacting LLMs that pursue cooperative, competitive, or mixed objectives. This emerging paradigm provides a powerful testbed for studying social dynamics and strategic behaviors among intelligent agents. However, current research remains fragmented and lacks a unifying theoretical foundation. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey of LLM-based multi-agent systems through a game-theoretic lens. By organizing existing studies around the four key elements of game theory: players, strategies, payoffs, and information, we establish a systematic framework for understanding, comparing, and guiding future research on the design and analysis of LLM-based MAS.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Standardizing OTFS: A Candidate Waveform for Next-Generation Wireless Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15048</link><description>arXiv:2601.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standardization of the sixth-generation (6G) has recently commenced to address the rapidly growing demands for enhanced wireless network services. Nevertheless, existing wireless systems, particularly at the physical layer waveform level, remain inadequate for achieving the ambitious key performance indicators (KPIs) envisioned for 6G. Specifically, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the widely adopted waveform in fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) networks, suffers from inherent limitations in satisfying these stringent requirements. In practice, OFDM can experience severe inter-carrier interference (ICI), resulting in a pronounced data rate error floor caused by high Doppler shifts. Additionally, the repetitive usage of cyclic prefixes (CPs), intended to combat multipath delays, results in significant spectral inefficiency. These fundamental drawbacks pose critical obstacles to fulfilling 6G performance objectives. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as a promising waveform candidate, addressing the aforementioned challenges by exploiting the unique characteristics of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel. Unlike OFDM, OTFS is inherently resilient to channel distortions induced by delay and Doppler effects, while remaining sensitive to time and frequency shifts. Such intrinsic properties are instrumental in enabling OTFS, with joint communication and sensing capabilities, to embrace, rather than combat, dynamic channel conditions. Motivated by these compelling advantages, this article investigates the feasibility and practical implementation of OTFS modulation leveraging the current OFDM-based wireless systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Leakage with Generative Flow Matching Denoiser</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15049</link><description>arXiv:2601.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized model training, yet it remains vulnerable to deep leakage (DL) attacks that reconstruct private client data from shared model updates. While prior DL methods have demonstrated varying levels of success, they often suffer from instability, limited fidelity, or poor robustness under realistic FL settings. We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification. Our findings call for the development of new defense strategies that explicitly account for adversaries equipped with powerful generative priors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] \textsc{LogicScore}: Fine-grained Logic Evaluation of Conciseness, Completeness, and Determinateness in Attributed Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15050</link><description>arXiv:2601.15050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluation methods for Attributed Question Answering (AQA) suffer from \textit{attribution myopia}: they emphasize verification of isolated statements and their attributions but overlook the global logical integrity of long-form answers. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce factually grounded yet logically incoherent responses with elusive deductive gaps. To mitigate this limitation, we present \textsc{LogicScore}, a unified evaluation framework that shifts the paradigm from local assessment to global reasoning scrutiny. Grounded in Horn Rules, our approach integrates a backward verification mechanism to systematically evaluate three key reasoning dimensions: \textit{Completeness} (logically sound deduction), \textit{Conciseness} (non-redundancy), and \textit{Determinateness} (consistent answer entailment). Extensive experiments across three multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, MusiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) and over 20 LLMs (including GPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, LLaMA3, and task-specific tuned models) reveal a critical capability gap: leading models often achieve high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85\% precision for Gemini-3 Pro) but struggle with global reasoning quality (e.g., 35.11\% Conciseness for Gemini-3 Pro). Our work establishes a robust standard for logical evaluation, highlighting the need to prioritize reasoning coherence alongside factual grounding in LLM development.

Abstract: Traditional defenses against Deep Leakage (DL) attacks in Federated Learning (FL) primarily focus on obfuscation, introducing noise, transformations or encryption to degrade an attacker's ability to reconstruct private data. While effective to some extent, these methods often still leak high-level information such as class distributions or feature representations, and are frequently broken by increasingly powerful denoising attacks. We propose a fundamentally different perspective on FL defense: framing it as a spoofing problem.We introduce SpooFL (Figure 1), a spoofing-based defense that deceives attackers into believing they have recovered the true training data, while actually providing convincing but entirely synthetic samples from an unrelated task. Unlike prior synthetic-data defenses that share classes or distributions with the private data and thus still leak semantic information, SpooFL uses a state-of-the-art generative model trained on an external dataset with no class overlap. As a result, attackers are misled into recovering plausible yet completely irrelevant samples, preventing meaningful data leakage while preserving FL training integrity. We implement the first example of such a spoofing defense, and evaluate our method against state-of-the-art DL defenses and demonstrate that it successfully misdirects attackers without compromising model performance significantly.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15055v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Systematic Evaluation of Hip Exoskeleton Assistance Parameters for Enhancing Gait Stability During Ground Slip Perturbations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15056</link><description>arXiv:2601.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Falls are the leading cause of injury related hospitalization and mortality among older adults. Consequently, mitigating age-related declines in gait stability and reducing fall risk during walking is a critical goal for assistive devices. Lower-limb exoskeletons have the potential to support users in maintaining stability during walking. However, most exoskeleton controllers are optimized to reduce the energetic cost of walking rather than to improve stability. While some studies report stability benefits with assistance, the effects of specific parameters, such as assistance magnitude and duration, remain unexplored. To address this gap, we systematically modulated the magnitude and duration of torque provided by a bilateral hip exoskeleton during slip perturbations in eight healthy adults, quantifying stability using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). WBAM responses were governed by a significant interaction between assistance magnitude and duration, with duration determining whether exoskeleton assistance was stabilizing or destabilizing relative to not wearing the exoskeleton device. Compared to an existing energy-optimized controller, experimentally identified stability-optimal parameters reduced WBAM range by 25.7% on average. Notably, substantial inter-subject variability was observed in the parameter combinations that minimized WBAM during perturbations. We found that optimizing exoskeleton assistance for energetic outcomes alone is insufficient for improving reactive stability during gait perturbations. Stability-focused exoskeleton control should prioritize temporal assistance parameters and include user-specific personalization. This study represents an important step toward personalized, stability-focused exoskeleton control, with direct implications for improving stability and reducing fall risk in older adults.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15056v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Responsibility Vacuum: Organizational Failure in Scaled Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15059</link><description>arXiv:2601.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern CI/CD pipelines integrating agent-generated code exhibit a structural failure in responsibility attribution. Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.
  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.
  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.
  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.
  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15059v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Differential Privacy Image Generation with Reconstruction Loss and Noise Injection Using an Error Feedback SGD</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15061</link><description>arXiv:2601.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional data masking techniques such as anonymization cannot achieve the expected privacy protection while ensuring data utility for privacy-preserving machine learning. Synthetic data plays an increasingly important role as it generates a large number of training samples and prevents information leakage in real data. The existing methods suffer from the repeating trade-off processes between privacy and utility. We propose a novel framework for differential privacy generation, which employs an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent(EFSGD) method and introduces a reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism into the training process. We generate images with higher quality and usability under the same privacy budget as the related work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework for both grayscale and RGB images. We achieve state-of-the-art results over almost all metrics on three benchmarks: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15061v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Turning Citation Networks Inside Out: Studying Science Using Content-Based Knowledge Graphs from LLM-Derived Taxonomies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15062</link><description>arXiv:2601.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific fields are often mapped using citations and metadata, despite knowledge being transmitted primarily through content. We introduce an 'inside-out' approach that reconstructs field structure directly from text by representing each paper as a small set of interpretable knowledge components. Using a large language model to induce domain-specific taxonomies and label papers, each publication is encoded as a triplet of measure, data type, and research-question type. These triplets define a knowledge graph with edges weighted by shared papers. Applied to 617 studies on intergenerational wealth mobility, the graph reveals a stable methodological backbone centered on regression-based mobility measures, alongside substantial temporal variation in component recombination. We further utilize normalized betweenness-to-connectivity ratios to identify components and pairings that act as structural bridges disproportionate to their prevalence. This content-derived, taxonomy-driven mapping complements citation-based approaches by exposing the evolving architecture of methods, data, and questions that define a field.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15062v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Incentive-Tuning: Understanding and Designing Incentives for Empirical Human-AI Decision-Making Studies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15064</link><description>arXiv:2601.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI has revolutionised decision-making across various fields. Yet human judgement remains paramount for high-stakes decision-making. This has fueled explorations of collaborative decision-making between humans and AI systems, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. To explore this dynamic, researchers conduct empirical studies, investigating how humans use AI assistance for decision-making and how this collaboration impacts results. A critical aspect of conducting these studies is the role of participants, often recruited through crowdsourcing platforms. The validity of these studies hinges on the behaviours of the participants, hence effective incentives that can potentially affect these behaviours are a key part of designing and executing these studies. In this work, we aim to address the critical role of incentive design for conducting empirical human-AI decision-making studies, focusing on understanding, designing, and documenting incentive schemes. Through a thematic review of existing research, we explored the current practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with incentive design for human-AI decision-making empirical studies. We identified recurring patterns, or themes, such as what comprises the components of an incentive scheme, how incentive schemes are manipulated by researchers, and the impact they can have on research outcomes. Leveraging the acquired understanding, we curated a set of guidelines to aid researchers in designing effective incentive schemes for their studies, called the Incentive-Tuning Framework, outlining how researchers can undertake, reflect on, and document the incentive design process. By advocating for a standardised yet flexible approach to incentive design and contributing valuable insights along with practical tools, we hope to pave the way for more reliable and generalizable knowledge in the field of human-AI decision-making.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection via the Refinement of Foreground and Background</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15065</link><description>arXiv:2601.15065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP-based foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in improving few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain channel estimation (CDCE) algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, leveraging the unique characteristics of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel. Specifically, the proposed algorithm transforms the time-frequency (TF) domain pilot sequence of OFDM into the DD domain and applies a two-dimensional (2D) twisted-convolution for acquiring a coarse estimation of the underlying channel delay and Doppler. Then, the OFDM channel estimation is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem in the TF domain according to the dictionary derived based on the obtained delay and Doppler estimates. Furthermore, a low-complexity $\ell_1$-regularized least-square estimator is proposed to effectively solve this problem. Moreover, we further develop a performance analysis framework of the proposed scheme based on the ambiguity function (AF) of the adopted pilot sequence. Our numerical results demonstrate noticeable estimation performance improvement compared to conventional OFDM channel estimation methods, particularly in the presence of high channel mobility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Economic Warehouse Lot Scheduling: Breaking the 2-Approximation Barrier</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15068</link><description>arXiv:2601.15068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The economic warehouse lot scheduling problem is a foundational inventory-theory model, capturing computational challenges in dynamically coordinating replenishment decisions for multiple commodities subject to a shared capacity constraint. Even though this model has generated a vast body of literature over the last six decades, our algorithmic understanding has remained surprisingly limited. Indeed, for general problem instances, the best-known approximation guarantees have remained at a factor of $2$ since the mid-1990s. These guarantees were attained by the now-classic work of Anily [Operations Research, 1991] and Gallego, Queyranne, and Simchi-Levi [Operations Research, 1996] via the highly-structured class of "stationary order sizes and stationary intervals" (SOSI) policies, thereby avoiding direct competition against fully dynamic policies.
  The main contribution of this paper resides in developing new analytical foundations and algorithmic techniques that enable such direct comparisons, leading to the first provable improvement over the $2$-approximation barrier. Leveraging these ideas, we design a constructive approach that allows us to balance cost and capacity at a finer granularity than previously possible via SOSI-based methods. Consequently, given any economic warehouse lot scheduling instance, we present a polynomial-time construction of a random capacity-feasible dynamic policy whose expected long-run average cost is within factor $2-\frac{17}{5000} + \epsilon$ of optimal.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15068v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Influence of Operator Expertise on Robot Supervision and Intervention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15069</link><description>arXiv:2601.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing levels of robot autonomy, robots are increasingly being supervised by users with varying levels of robotics expertise. As the diversity of the user population increases, it is important to understand how users with different expertise levels approach the supervision task and how this impacts performance of the human-robot team. This exploratory study investigates how operators with varying expertise levels perceive information and make intervention decisions when supervising a remote robot. We conducted a user study (N=27) where participants supervised a robot autonomously exploring four unknown tunnel environments in a simulator, and provided waypoints to intervene when they believed the robot had encountered difficulties. By analyzing the interaction data and questionnaire responses, we identify differing patterns in intervention timing and decision-making strategies across novice, intermediate, and expert users.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15069v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimized Schwarz Waveform Relaxation for the Damped Wave Equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15070</link><description>arXiv:2601.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Schwarz Waveform Relaxation is critically dependent on the choice of transmission conditions. While classical absorbing conditions work well for wave propagation, they prove insufficient for damped wave equations, particularly in viscoelastic damping regimes where convergence becomes prohibitively slow. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a more general transmission operator with two free parameters for the one-dimensional damped wave equation. Through frequency-domain analysis, we derive an explicit expression for the convergence factor governing the convergence rate. We propose and compare two optimization strategies (L-infinity and L-2 minimization) for determining optimal transmission parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our optimized approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to standard absorbing conditions, especially for viscoelastic damping cases. The method provides a computationally efficient alternative to exhaustive parameter search while maintaining robust performance across different damping regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15070v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Pictorial Cortex: Zero-Shot Cross-Subject fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction via Compositional Latent Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15071</link><description>arXiv:2601.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from human brain activity remains a central challenge at the intersection of neuroscience, neuroimaging, and artificial intelligence. A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization-composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15071v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SmartOracle -- An Agentic Approach to Mitigate Noise in Differential Oracles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15074</link><description>arXiv:2601.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential fuzzers detect bugs by executing identical inputs across distinct implementations of the same specification, such as JavaScript interpreters. Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated.
  Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict.
  For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\times$ and API costs by 10$\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS.
  The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15074v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Why Behind the Action: Unveiling Internal Drivers via Agentic Attribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15075</link><description>arXiv:2601.15075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are widely used in real-world applications such as customer service, web navigation, and software engineering. As these systems become more autonomous and are deployed at scale, understanding why an agent takes a particular action becomes increasingly important for accountability and governance. However, existing research predominantly focuses on \textit{failure attribution} to localize explicit errors in unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining the reasoning behind agent behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind the agent behavior, offering a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15075v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Agent Constraint Factorization Reveals Latent Invariant Solution Structure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15077</link><description>arXiv:2601.15077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of large language models often exhibit improved problem-solving performance despite operating on identical information. In this work, we provide a formal explanation for this phenomenon grounded in operator theory and constrained optimization. We model each agent as enforcing a distinct family of validity constraints on a shared solution state, and show that a MAS implements a factorized composition of constraint-enforcement operators. Under mild conditions, these dynamics converge to invariant solution sets defined by the intersection of agent constraint sets. Such invariant structures are generally not dynamically accessible to a single agent applying all constraints simultaneously, even when expressive capacity and information are identical. We extend this result from exact constraint enforcement to soft constraints via proximal operators, and apply the formalism to contemporary text-based dialog systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15077v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LoRAP: Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting for Quantized Graph Neural Networks Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15079</link><description>arXiv:2601.15079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks that aim to process graph data, capturing the relationships and interactions between nodes using the message-passing mechanism. GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15079v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bangla Music Genre Classification Using Bidirectional LSTMS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15083</link><description>arXiv:2601.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bangla music is enrich in its own music cultures. Now a days music genre classification is very significant because of the exponential increase in available music, both in digital and physical formats. It is necessary to index them accordingly to facilitate improved retrieval. Automatically classifying Bangla music by genre is essential for efficiently locating specific pieces within a vast and diverse music library. Prevailing methods for genre classification predominantly employ conventional machine learning or deep learning approaches. This work introduces a novel music dataset comprising ten distinct genres of Bangla music. For the task of audio classification, we utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is implemented to train the model and perform the classification. Feature extraction represents a foundational stage in audio data processing. This study utilizes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to transform raw audio waveforms into a compact and representative set of features. The proposed framework facilitates music genre classification by leveraging these extracted features. Experimental results demonstrate a classification accuracy of 78%, indicating the system's strong potential to enhance and streamline the organization of Bangla music genres.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15083v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Memory Retention Is Not Enough to Master Memory Tasks in Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15086</link><description>arXiv:2601.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective decision-making in the real world depends on memory that is both stable and adaptive: environments change over time, and agents must retain relevant information over long horizons while also updating or overwriting outdated content when circumstances shift. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

Abstract: Human cognition exhibits strong circadian modulation, yet its influence on high-dimensional semantic behavior remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Reddit data, we quantify time-of-day variation in language use by embedding text into a pretrained transformer model and measuring semantic entropy as an index of linguistic exploration-exploitation, for which we show a robust circadian rhythmicity that could be entrained by seasonal light cues. Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with "rich-get-richer" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood. The observed temporal structure aligns with known diurnal patterns in neuromodulatory systems, suggesting that biological circadian rhythms extend to the semantic domain.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Fine-Tuning in Code-Related Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15094</link><description>arXiv:2601.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven highly effective in automating software engineering tasks, bridging natural language and code semantics to achieve notable results in code generation and summarization. However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15094v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Three-dimensional visualization of X-ray micro-CT with large-scale datasets: Efficiency and accuracy for real-time interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15098</link><description>arXiv:2601.15098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Micro-CT technology continues to refine its characterization of material microstructures, industrial CT ultra-precision inspection is generating increasingly large datasets, necessitating solutions to the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in the 3D characterization of defects during ultra-precise detection.

Abstract: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are essential for capturing local climate change. However, these models are computationally expensive and produce petabyte-scale outputs, which limits their utility for applications such as probabilistic risk assessment. Here, we present the Field-Space Autoencoder, a scalable climate emulation framework based on a spherical compression model that overcomes these challenges. By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data. Our work bridges the gap between the high volume of low-resolution ensemble statistics and the scarcity of high-resolution physical detail.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15102v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Myhill-Nerode Characterization and Active Learning for One-Clock Timed Automata</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15104</link><description>arXiv:2601.15104v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The interoperability of data and intelligence across allied partners and their respective end-user groups is considered a foundational enabler to the collective defense capability--both conventional and hybrid--of NATO countries. Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to the characterization of threats, sustaining situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further led to the decreasing cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content. Despite the introduction of the DISARM framework as a standardized metadata and analytical framework for FIMI, operationalizing it at the scale of social media remains a challenge. We propose a framework-agnostic agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media. We develop a multi-agent pipeline in which specialized agentic AI components collaboratively (1) detect candidate manipulative behaviors, and (2) map these behaviors onto standard DISARM taxonomies in a transparent manner. We evaluated the approach on two real-world datasets annotated by domain practitioners. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in scaling the predominantly manual and heavily interpretive work of FIMI analysis, providing a direct contribution to enhancing the situational awareness and data interoperability in the context of operating in media and information-rich settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15109v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pb4U-GNet: Resolution-Adaptive Garment Simulation via Propagation-before-Update Graph Network</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15110</link><description>arXiv:2601.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Garment simulation is fundamental to various applications in computer vision and graphics, from virtual try-on to digital human modelling. However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15110v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Auditing Language Model Unlearning via Information Decomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15111</link><description>arXiv:2601.15111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expose a critical limitation in current approaches to machine unlearning in language models: despite the apparent success of unlearning algorithms, information about the forgotten data remains linearly decodable from internal representations. To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose a representation-based risk score that can guide abstention on sensitive inputs at inference time, providing a practical mechanism to mitigate privacy leakage. Our work introduces a principled, representation-level audit for unlearning, offering theoretical insight and actionable tools for safer deployment of language models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15111v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Informed Wireless Imaging with Implicit Neural Representation in RIS-Aided ISAC System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15113</link><description>arXiv:2601.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless imaging is emerging as a key capability in next-generation integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, supporting diverse context-aware applications.

To address these issues, this study explores the use of implicit neural representation (INR), a paradigm that has achieved notable advancements in computer vision, for wireless imaging in reconfigurable intelligent surface-aided ISAC systems. The neural network of INR is specifically designed with positional encoding and sine activation functions. Leveraging physics-informed loss functions, INR is optimized through deep learning to represent continuous target shapes and scattering profiles, enabling resolution-agnostic imaging with strong generalization capability. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed INR-based method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques and further reveals the focal length characteristics of the imaging system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15113v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Who They Are to How They Act: Behavioral Traits in Generative Agent-Based Models of Social Media</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15114</link><description>arXiv:2601.15114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) leverages Large Language Models to create autonomous agents that simulate human behavior in social media environments, demonstrating potential for modeling information propagation, influence processes, and network phenomena. While existing frameworks characterize agents through demographic attributes, personality traits, and interests, they lack mechanisms to encode behavioral dispositions toward platform actions, causing agents to exhibit homogeneous engagement patterns rather than the differentiated participation styles observed on real platforms. In this paper, we investigate the role of behavioral traits as an explicit characterization layer to regulate agents' propensities across posting, re-sharing, commenting, reacting, and inactivity. Through large-scale simulations involving 980 agents and validation against real-world social media data, we demonstrate that behavioral traits are essential to sustain heterogeneous, profile-consistent participation patterns and enable realistic content propagation dynamics through the interplay of amplification- and interaction-oriented profiles. Our findings establish that modeling how agents act-not only who they are-is necessary for advancing GABM as a tool for studying social media phenomena.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Training-Free and Interpretable Hateful Video Detection via Multi-stage Adversarial Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15115</link><description>arXiv:2601.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hateful videos pose serious risks by amplifying discrimination, inciting violence, and undermining online safety. Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

Abstract: Whisper has become the de-facto encoder for extracting general-purpose audio features in large audio-language models, where a 30-second clip is typically represented by 1500 frame features projected into an LLM. In contrast, audio-text embedding models like CLAP-based models have largely relied on alternative audio encoders (e.g., HTS-AT, PaSST), and have not leveraged Whisper effectively. We present WavLink, a compact audio-text embedding model that augments Whisper encoder with a learnable global token, trained jointly with a text encoder. Through a systematic study of design choices, including pretrained text encoders, loss functions, training modes, and data mixtures, we identify configurations that yield state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Our two-stage training recipe across three model sizes, combined with Matryoshka-style supervision, improves scalability, enabling 8x smaller embeddings with minimal performance drop. WavLink also demonstrates competitive performance on AIR-Bench with MCQs and zero-shot classification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15118v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Emerging from Ground: Addressing Intent Deviation in Tool-Using Agents via Deriving Real Calls into Virtual Trajectories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15120</link><description>arXiv:2601.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15120v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Insight to Intervention: Interpretable Neuron Steering for Controlling Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15122</link><description>arXiv:2601.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popularity bias is a pervasive challenge in recommender systems, where a few popular items dominate attention while the majority of less popular items remain underexposed. This imbalance can reduce recommendation quality and lead to unfair item exposure. Although existing mitigation methods address this issue to some extent, they often lack transparency in how they operate. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc approach, PopSteer, that leverages a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to both interpret and mitigate popularity bias in recommendation models. The SAE is trained to replicate a trained model's behavior while enabling neuron-level interpretability. By introducing synthetic users with strong preferences for either popular or unpopular items, we identify neurons encoding popularity signals through their activation patterns. We then steer recommendations by adjusting the activations of the most biased neurons. Experiments on three public datasets with a sequential recommendation model demonstrate that PopSteer significantly enhances fairness with minimal impact on accuracy, while providing interpretable insights and fine-grained control over the fairness-accuracy trade-off.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15122v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BREPS: Bounding-Box Robustness Evaluation of Promptable Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15123</link><description>arXiv:2601.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promptable segmentation models such as SAM have established a powerful paradigm, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and domains with minimal user input, including points, bounding boxes, and text prompts. Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging.

Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as a frontier in graph learning, which are expected to deliver transferable representations across diverse tasks. However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepFedNAS: A Unified Framework for Principled, Hardware-Aware, and Predictor-Free Federated Neural Architecture Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15127</link><description>arXiv:2601.15127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) aims to automate model design for privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) but currently faces two critical bottlenecks: unguided supernet training that yields suboptimal models, and costly multi-hour pipelines for post-training subnet discovery. We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated comparable performance to that of radiology trainees on multiple-choice board-style exams. However, to develop clinically useful multimodal LLM tools, high-quality benchmarks curated by domain experts are essential. To curate released and holdout datasets of 100 chest radiographic studies each and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted expert labeling procedure to allow radiologists to label studies more efficiently. A total of 13,735 deidentified chest radiographs and their corresponding reports from the MIDRC were used. GPT-4o extracted abnormal findings from the reports, which were then mapped to 12 benchmark labels with a locally hosted LLM (Phi-4-Reasoning). From these studies, 1,000 were sampled on the basis of the AI-suggested benchmark labels for expert review; the sampling algorithm ensured that the selected studies were clinically relevant and captured a range of difficulty levels. Seventeen chest radiologists participated, and they marked "Agree all", "Agree mostly" or "Disagree" to indicate their assessment of the correctness of the LLM suggested labels. Each chest radiograph was evaluated by three experts. Of these, at least two radiologists selected "Agree All" for 381 radiographs. From this set, 200 were selected, prioritizing those with less common or multiple finding labels, and divided into 100 released radiographs and 100 reserved as the holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is used exclusively by RSNA to independently evaluate different models. A benchmark of 200 chest radiographic studies with 12 benchmark labels was created and made publicly available https://imaging.rsna.org, with each chest radiograph verified by three radiologists. In addition, an AI-assisted labeling procedure was developed to help radiologists label at scale, minimize unnecessary omissions, and support a semicollaborative environment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15129v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Plausibility Trap: Using Probabilistic Engines for Deterministic Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15130</link><description>arXiv:2601.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) is driving a paradigm shift where user convenience supersedes computational efficiency. This article defines the "Plausibility Trap": a phenomenon where individuals with access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deploy expensive probabilistic engines for simple deterministic tasks-such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or basic verification-resulting in significant resource waste. Through micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking, we quantify the "efficiency tax"-demonstrating a ~6.5x latency penalty-and the risks of algorithmic sycophancy. To counter this, we introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix, a framework to help developers determine when to use Generative AI and, crucially, when to avoid it. We argue for a curriculum shift, emphasizing that true digital literacy relies not only in knowing how to use Generative AI, but also on knowing when not to use it.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15130v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vehicle Routing with Finite Time Horizon using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Improved Network Embedding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15131</link><description>arXiv:2601.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the vehicle routing problem with a finite time horizon. In this routing problem, the objective is to maximize the number of customer requests served within a finite time horizon. We present a novel routing network embedding module which creates local node embedding vectors and a context-aware global graph representation. The proposed Markov decision process for the vehicle routing problem incorporates the node features, the network adjacency matrix and the edge features as components of the state space. We incorporate the remaining finite time horizon into the network embedding module to provide a proper routing context to the embedding module. We integrate our embedding module with a policy gradient-based deep Reinforcement Learning framework to solve the vehicle routing problem with finite time horizon. We trained and validated our proposed routing method on real-world routing networks, as well as synthetically generated Euclidean networks. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a higher customer service rate than the existing routing methods. Additionally, the solution time of our method is significantly lower than that of the existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15131v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph Recognition via Subgraph Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15133</link><description>arXiv:2601.15133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite tremendous improvements in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, the recognition of visual relationships, commonly modeled as the extraction of a graph from an image, remains a challenging task. We believe that this mainly stems from the fact that there is no canonical way to approach the visual graph recognition task. Most existing solutions are specific to a problem and cannot be transferred between different contexts out-of-the box, even though the conceptual problem remains the same. With broad applicability and simplicity in mind, in this paper we develop a method, \textbf{Gra}ph Recognition via \textbf{S}ubgraph \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{GraSP}), for recognizing graphs in images. We show across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application that our method works with a set of diverse types of graphs and their drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications, paving the way to a more unified framework for visual graph recognition.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15133v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic EMS for Optimal 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Operations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15135</link><description>arXiv:2601.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization formulation to determine optimal operation and procurement plans for achieving a 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) compliance at minimized cost. The system in consideration follows primary energy technologies in Thailand including solar power, battery storage, and a diverse portfolio of renewable and carbon-based energy procurement sources. Unlike existing literature focused on long-term planning, this study addresses near real-time operations using a 15-minute resolution. A novel feature of the formulation is the explicit treatment of CFE compliance as a model parameter, enabling flexible targets such as a minimum percentage of hourly matching or a required number of carbon-free days within a multi-day horizon. The mixed-integer linear programming formulation accounts for uncertainties in load and solar generation by integrating deep learning-based forecasting within a receding horizon framework. By optimizing battery profiles and multi-source procurement simultaneously, the proposed system provides a feasible pathway for transitioning to carbon-free operations in emerging energy markets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15135v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Why Authors and Maintainers Link (or Don't Link) Their PyPI Libraries to Code Repositories and Donation Platforms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15139</link><description>arXiv:2601.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metadata of libraries on the Python Package Index (PyPI)-including links to source code repositories and donation platforms-plays a critical role in supporting the transparency, trust, and sustainability of open-source libraries. Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15139v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CLEANER: Self-Purified Trajectories Boost Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15141</link><description>arXiv:2601.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

Abstract: Gaze-based interaction enables intuitive, hands-free control in immersive environments, but remains susceptible to unintended inputs. We present a real-time error prevention system (EPS) that uses a temporal convolutional network autoencoder (TCNAE) to detect anomalies in gaze dynamics during selection tasks. In a visual search task in VR, 41 participants used three gaze-based methods - dwell time, gaze and head direction alignment, and nod - with and without EPS. The system reduced erroneous selections by up to 95% for dwell time and gaze and head, and was positively received by most users. Performance varied for nodding and between individuals, suggesting the need for adaptive systems. Objective metrics and subjective evaluations show that anomaly-based error prevention can improve gaze interfaces without disrupting interaction. These findings demonstrate the potential of anomaly-based error prevention for gaze interfaces and suggest applications in VR, AR, and assistive technologies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interval Scheduling Games</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15148</link><description>arXiv:2601.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a game-theoretic variant of an interval scheduling problem. Every job is associated with a length, a weight, and a color. Each player controls all the jobs of a specific color, and needs to decide on a processing interval for each of its jobs. Jobs of the same color can be processed simultaneously by the machine. A job is covered if the machine is configured to its color during its whole processing interval. The goal of the machine is to maximize the sum of weights of all covered jobs, and the goal of each player is to place its jobs such that the sum of weights of covered jobs from its color is maximized. The study of this game is motivated by several applications like antenna scheduling for wireless networks.
  We first show that given a strategy profile of the players, the machine scheduling problem can be solved in polynomial time. We then study the game from the players' point of view. We analyze the existence of Nash equilibria, its computation, and inefficiency. We distinguish between instances of the classical interval scheduling problem, in which every player controls a single job, and instances in which color sets may include multiple jobs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15148v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pipeline Automation Framework for Reusable High-throughput Network Applications on FPGA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15151</link><description>arXiv:2601.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a context of ever-growing worldwide communication traffic, cloud service providers aim at deploying scalable infrastructures to address heterogeneous needs. Part of the network infrastructure, FPGAs are tailored to guarantee low-latency and high-throughput packet processing. However, slowness of the hardware design process impairs FPGA ability to be part of an agile infrastructure under constant evolution, from incident response to long-term transformation. Deploying and maintaining network functionalities across a wide variety of FPGAs raises the need to fine-tune hardware designs for several FPGA targets. To address this issue, we introduce PAF, an open-source architectural parameterization framework based on a pipeline-oriented design methodology. PAF (Pipeline Automation Framework) implementation is based on Chisel, a Scala-embedded Hardware Construction Language (HCL), that we leverage to interface with circuit elaboration. Applied to industrial network packet classification systems, PAF demonstrates efficient parameterization abilities, enabling to reuse and optimize the same pipelined design on several FPGAs. In addition, PAF focuses the pipeline description on the architectural intent, incidentally reducing the number of lines of code to express complex functionalities. Finally, PAF confirms that automation does not imply any loss of tight control on the architecture by achieving on par performance and resource usage with equivalent exhaustively described implementations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How to Build AI Agents by Augmenting LLMs with Codified Human Expert Domain Knowledge?

Abstract: Critical domain knowledge typically resides with few experts, creating organizational bottlenecks in scalability and decision-making. Non-experts struggle to create effective visualizations, leading to suboptimal insights and diverting expert time. This paper investigates how to capture and embed human domain knowledge into AI agent systems through an industrial case study. We propose a software engineering framework to capture human domain knowledge for engineering AI agents in simulation data visualization by augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a request classifier, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for code generation, codified expert rules, and visualization design principles unified in an agent demonstrating autonomous, reactive, proactive, and social behavior. Evaluation across five scenarios spanning multiple engineering domains with 12 evaluators demonstrates 206% improvement in output quality, with our agent achieving expert-level ratings in all cases versus baseline's poor performance, while maintaining superior code quality with lower variance. Our contributions are: an automated agent-based system for visualization generation and a validated framework for systematically capturing human domain knowledge and codifying tacit expert knowledge into AI agents, demonstrating that non-experts can achieve expert-level outcomes in specialized domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15153v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAGA: Detecting Security Vulnerabilities Using Static Aspect Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15154</link><description>arXiv:2601.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Python is one of the most popular programming languages; as such, projects written in Python involve an increasing number of diverse security vulnerabilities. However, existing state-of-the-art analysis tools for Python only support a few vulnerability types. Hence, there is a need to detect a large variety of vulnerabilities in Python projects.
  In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties.
  We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools.

Abstract: Transformers trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision can spontaneously develop the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought). Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of "simple examples": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15158v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowledge Graphs are Implicit Reward Models: Path-Derived Signals Enable Compositional Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15160</link><description>arXiv:2601.15160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved near-expert performance in structured reasoning domains like mathematics and programming, yet their ability to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields remains limited. We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a "compositional bridge", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15160v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated Rubrics for Reliable Evaluation of Medical Dialogue Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15161</link><description>arXiv:2601.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for clinical decision support, where hallucinations and unsafe suggestions may pose direct risks to patient safety. These risks are particularly challenging as they often manifest as subtle clinical errors that evade detection by generic metrics, while expert-authored fine-grained rubrics remain costly to construct and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed to automate the generation of instance-specific evaluation rubrics. Our approach grounds evaluation in authoritative medical evidence by decomposing retrieved content into atomic facts and synthesizing them with user interaction constraints to form verifiable, fine-grained evaluation criteria. Evaluated on HealthBench, our framework achieves a Clinical Intent Alignment (CIA) score of 60.12%, a statistically significant improvement over the GPT-4o baseline (55.16%). In discriminative tests, our rubrics yield a mean score delta ($\mu_{\Delta} = 8.658$) and an AUROC of 0.977, nearly doubling the quality separation achieved by GPT-4o baseline (4.972). Beyond evaluation, our rubrics effectively guide response refinement, improving quality by 9.2% (from 59.0% to 68.2%). This provides a scalable and transparent foundation for both evaluating and improving medical LLMs. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Automated-Rubric-Generation-AF3C/.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15161v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Promises and Perils of using LLMs for Effective Public Services</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15163</link><description>arXiv:2601.15163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Governments are the primary providers of essential public services and are responsible for delivering them effectively. In high-stakes decision-making domains such as child welfare (CW), agencies must protect children without unnecessarily prolonging a family's engagement with the system. With growing optimism around AI, governments are pushing for its integration but concerns regarding feasibility and harms remain. Through collaborations with a large Canadian CW agency, we examined how LocalLLM and BERTopic models can track CW case progress. We demonstrate how the tools can potentially assist workers in opportunistically addressing gaps in their work by signaling case progress/deviations. And yet, we also show how they fail to detect case trajectories that require discretionary judgments grounded in social work training, areas where practitioners would actually want support to pre-emptively address substantive case concerns. We also provide a roadmap of future participatory directions to co-design language tools for/with the public sector.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15163v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] V-CAGE: Context-Aware Generation and Verification for Scalable Long-Horizon Embodied Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15164</link><description>arXiv:2601.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning long-horizon embodied behaviors from synthetic data remains challenging because generated scenes are often physically implausible, language-driven programs frequently "succeed" without satisfying task semantics, and high-level instructions require grounding into executable action sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce V-CAGE, a closed-loop framework for generating robust, semantically aligned manipulation datasets at scale. First, we propose a context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis. By dynamically maintaining a map of prohibited spatial areas as objects are placed, our system prevents interpenetration and ensures reachable, conflict-free configurations in cluttered environments. Second, to bridge the gap between abstract intent and low-level control, we employ a hierarchical instruction decomposition module. This decomposes high-level goals (e.g., "get ready for work") into compositional action primitives, facilitating coherent long-horizon planning. Crucially, we enforce semantic correctness through a VLM-based verification loop. Acting as a visual critic, the VLM performs rigorous rejection sampling after each subtask, filtering out "silent failures" where code executes but fails to achieve the visual goal. Experiments demonstrate that V-CAGE yields datasets with superior physical and semantic fidelity, significantly boosting the success rate and generalization of downstream policies compared to non-verified baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15164v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Flexibility Trap: Why Arbitrary Order Limits Reasoning Potential in Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15165</link><description>arXiv:2601.15165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) break the rigid left-to-right constraint of traditional LLMs, enabling token generation in arbitrary orders. Intuitively, this flexibility implies a solution space that strictly supersets the fixed autoregressive trajectory, theoretically unlocking superior reasoning potential for general tasks like mathematics and coding. Consequently, numerous works have leveraged reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit the reasoning capability of dLLMs. In this paper, we reveal a counter-intuitive reality: arbitrary order generation, in its current form, narrows rather than expands the reasoning boundary of dLLMs. We find that dLLMs tend to exploit this order flexibility to bypass high-uncertainty tokens that are crucial for exploration, leading to a premature collapse of the solution space. This observation challenges the premise of existing RL approaches for dLLMs, where considerable complexities, such as handling combinatorial trajectories and intractable likelihoods, are often devoted to preserving this flexibility. We demonstrate that effective reasoning is better elicited by intentionally forgoing arbitrary order and applying standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) instead. Our approach, JustGRPO, is minimalist yet surprisingly effective (e.g., 89.1% accuracy on GSM8K) while fully retaining the parallel decoding ability of dLLMs. Project page: https://nzl-thu.github.io/the-flexibility-trap</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15165v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Integrating OTFS in Airplane-Aided Next-Generation Networking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15166</link><description>arXiv:2601.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation networks explore the opportunistic assistance of airliner/high-altitude platforms (HAPs) in delivering high data rates for terrestrial networks to ensure consistent and reliable communication. When an airliner/HAP moves at very high speeds, its mobility has a substantial impact on ensuring seamless connectivity, stable signal strength, and reliable data transmission. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been shown to provide notable improvement in performance when handling Doppler effects during high-mobility situations. This paper presents an OTFS-based airplane-aided next-generation networking system. In the proposed system, the airliner/HAPs are equipped with a planar antenna array that applies null steering beamforming (NSB) at the transmitter for communication with terrestrial users. A comprehensive performance comparison between OTFS and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is performed under varying airliner altitude, velocity, array dimension, and Rician factor conditions. The simulation results show that OTFS consistently outperforms OFDM, achieving a lower bit error rate (BER) and more stable performance across different airliner altitudes, velocities, array dimensions, and propagation environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15166v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeGAS: Gradient-Based Optimization of Probabilistic Programs without Sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15167</link><description>arXiv:2601.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DeGAS, a differentiable Gaussian approximate semantics for loopless probabilistic programs that enables sample-free, gradient-based optimization in models with both continuous and discrete components. DeGAS evaluates programs under a Gaussian-mixture semantics and replaces measure-zero predicates and discrete branches with a vanishing smoothing, yielding closed-form expressions for posterior and path probabilities. We prove differentiability of these quantities with respect to program parameters, enabling end-to-end optimization via standard automatic differentiation, without Monte Carlo estimators. On thirteen benchmark programs, DeGAS achieves accuracy and runtime competitive with variational inference and MCMC. Importantly, it reliably tackles optimization problems where sampling-based baselines fail to converge due to conditioning involving continuous variables.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15167v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large-Scale Multidimensional Knowledge Profiling of Scientific Literature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15170</link><description>arXiv:2601.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of research across machine learning, vision, and language has produced a volume of publications that is increasingly difficult to synthesize. Traditional bibliometric tools rely mainly on metadata and offer limited visibility into the semantic content of papers, making it hard to track how research themes evolve over time or how different areas influence one another. To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content. By combining topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval, we derive a comprehensive representation of research activity that supports the study of topic lifecycles, methodological transitions, dataset and model usage patterns, and institutional research directions. Our analysis highlights several notable shifts, including the growth of safety, multimodal reasoning, and agent-oriented studies, as well as the gradual stabilization of areas such as neural machine translation and graph-based methods. These findings provide an evidence-based view of how AI research is evolving and offer a resource for understanding broader trends and identifying emerging directions.

Abstract: Peer review is at the heart of modern science. As submission numbers rise and research communities grow, the decline in review quality is a popular narrative and a common concern. Yet, is it true? Review quality is difficult to measure, and the ongoing evolution of reviewing practices makes it hard to compare reviews across venues and time. To address this, we introduce a new framework for evidence-based comparative study of review quality and apply it to major AI and machine learning conferences: ICLR, NeurIPS and *ACL. We document the diversity of review formats and introduce a new approach to review standardization. We propose a multi-dimensional schema for quantifying review quality as utility to editors and authors, coupled with both LLM-based and lightweight measurements. We study the relationships between measurements of review quality, and its evolution over time. Contradicting the popular narrative, our cross-temporal analysis reveals no consistent decline in median review quality across venues and years. We propose alternative explanations, and outline recommendations to facilitate future empirical studies of review quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15172v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic Management of a Deep Learning-Based Anomaly Detection System for 5G Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15177</link><description>arXiv:2601.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) will play a key role in the upcoming fifth generation (5G) mobile networks to support decentralized applications, data analytics and management into the network itself by using a highly distributed compute model. Furthermore, increasing attention is paid to providing user-centric cybersecurity solutions, which particularly require collecting, processing and analyzing significantly large amount of data traffic and huge number of network connections in 5G networks. In this regard, this paper proposes a MEC-oriented solution in 5G mobile networks to detect network anomalies in real-time and in autonomic way. Our proposal uses deep learning techniques to analyze network flows and to detect network anomalies. Moreover, it uses policies in order to provide an efficient and dynamic management system of the computing resources used in the anomaly detection process. The paper presents relevant aspects of the deployment of the proposal and experimental results to show its performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15177v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Complexity analysis and practical resolution of the data classification problem with private characteristics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15178</link><description>arXiv:2601.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the problem of, given the probability distribution of a population, questioning an unknown individual that is representative of the distribution so that our uncertainty about certain characteristics is significantly reduced -but the uncertainty about others, deemed private or sensitive, is not. Thus, the goal of the problem is extracting information being relevant to a legitimate purpose while preserving the privacy of individuals, which is crucial to enable non-intrusive selection processes in several areas. For instance, it is essential in the design of non-discriminatory personnel selection, promotion, and layoff processes in companies and institutions; in the retrieval of customer information being relevant to the service provided by a company (and no more); in certifications not revealing sensitive industrial information being irrelevant for the certification itself; etc. Interactive questioning processes are constructed for this purpose, which requires generalizing the notion of decision trees to account the amount of desired and undesired information retrieved for each branch of the plan. Our findings about this problem are both theoretical and practical: on the one hand, we prove its NP-completeness by a reduction from the Set Cover problem; and on the other hand, given this intractability, we provide heuristic solutions to find reasonable solutions in affordable time. In particular, a greedy algorithm and two genetic algorithms are presented. Our experiments indicate that the best results are obtained using a genetic algorithm reinforced with a greedy strategy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15178v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Supporting Humans in Evaluating AI Summaries of Legal Depositions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15182</link><description>arXiv:2601.15182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to summarize long documents, this trend poses significant challenges in the legal domain, where the factual accuracy of deposition summaries is crucial. Nugget-based methods have been shown to be extremely helpful for the automated evaluation of summarization approaches. In this work, we translate these methods to the user side and explore how nuggets could directly assist end users. Although prior systems have demonstrated the promise of nugget-based evaluation, its potential to support end users remains underexplored. Focusing on the legal domain, we present a prototype that leverages a factual nugget-based approach to support legal professionals in two concrete scenarios: (1) determining which of two summaries is better, and (2) manually improving an automatically generated summary.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15182v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Large Language Models for ABAP Code Generation: An Empirical Study on Iterative Improvement by Compiler Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15188</link><description>arXiv:2601.15188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating ABAP code. Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15188v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Parareal algorithm for coupled elliptic-parabolic problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15191</link><description>arXiv:2601.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a convergence analysis of the parallel-in-time integration method known as the Parareal algorithm for degenerate differential-algebraic systems arising from quasi-static Biot models, which govern coupled flow and deformation in porous media. The underlying system exhibits a saddle-point structure and degeneracy due to the quasi-static assumption. We extend the Parareal algorithm to this setting and propose three coarse propagators: monolithic, fixed-stress, and multirate fixed-stress schemes. For each, we derive sufficient conditions for convergence and establish explicit time step restrictions that guarantee contractivity of the iteration matrix. Numerical experiments show computational savings accrued by using a parareal solver in multiphysics simulations involving poroelasticity and other coupled systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15191v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Where Do AI Coding Agents Fail?

Abstract: AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15195v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TTCBF: A Truncated Taylor Control Barrier Function for High-Order Safety Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15196</link><description>arXiv:2601.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) enforce safety by rendering a prescribed safe set forward invariant. However, standard CBFs are limited to safety constraints with relative degree one, while High-Order CBF (HOCBF) methods address higher relative degree at the cost of introducing a chain of auxiliary functions and multiple class K functions whose tuning scales with the relative degree. In this paper, we introduce a Truncated Taylor Control Barrier Function (TTCBF), which generalizes standard discrete-time CBFs to consider high-order safety constraints and requires only one class K function, independent of the relative degree. We also propose an adaptive variant, adaptive TTCBF (aTTCBF), that optimizes an online gain on the class K function to improve adaptability, while requiring fewer control design parameters than existing adaptive HOCBF variants. Numerical experiments in a relative-degree-six spring-mass system and a cluttered corridor navigation validate the above theoretical findings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BayesianVLA: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15197</link><description>arXiv:2601.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\pi(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15197v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BBoxMaskPose v2: Expanding Mutual Conditioning to 3D</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15200</link><description>arXiv:2601.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most 2D human pose estimation benchmarks are nearly saturated, with the exception of crowded scenes. We introduce PMPose, a top-down 2D pose estimator that incorporates the probabilistic formulation and the mask-conditioning. PMPose improves crowded pose estimation without sacrificing performance on standard scenes. Building on this, we present BBoxMaskPose v2 (BMPv2) integrating PMPose and an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module. BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 average precision (AP) points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming the first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman. We demonstrate that BMP's 2D prompting of 3D model improves 3D pose estimation in crowded scenes and that advances in 2D pose quality directly benefit 3D estimation. Results on the new OCHuman-Pose dataset show that multi-person performance is more affected by pose prediction accuracy than by detection.

Abstract: Early and accurate classification of Alzheimers disease (AD) from brain MRI scans is essential for timely clinical intervention and improved patient outcomes. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of five CNN architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV3, VGG16), five Transformer-based models (ViT, ConvTransformer, PatchTransformer, MLP-Mixer, SimpleTransformer), and a proposed hybrid model named Evan_V2. All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed that Evan_V2 substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages, outperforming every standalone model. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid ensemble strategies in producing highly reliable and clinically meaningful diagnostic tools for Alzheimers disease classification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15202v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond the Geometric Curse: High-Dimensional N-Gram Hashing for Dense Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15205</link><description>arXiv:2601.15205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do even the most powerful 7B-parameter embedding models struggle with simple retrieval tasks that the decades old BM25 handles with ease? Recent theory suggests that this happens because of a dimensionality bottleneck. This occurs when we force infinite linguistic nuances into small, fixed-length learned vectors. We developed NUMEN to break this bottleneck by removing the learning process entirely. Instead of training heavy layers to map text to a constrained space, NUMEN uses deterministic character hashing to project language directly onto high-dimensional vectors. This approach requires no training, supports an unlimited vocabulary, and allows the geometric capacity scale as needed. On the LIMIT benchmark, NUMEN achieves 93.90 % Recall@100 at 32,768 dimensions. This makes it the first dense retrieval model to officially surpass the sparse BM25 baseline 93.6 %. Our findings show that the real problem in dense retrieval isn't the architecture, but the embedding layer itself. The solution isn't necessarily smarter training, but simply providing more room to breathe.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15205v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deaf and Hard of Hearing Access to Intelligent Personal Assistants: Comparison of Voice-Based Options with an LLM-Powered Touch Interface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15209</link><description>arXiv:2601.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people who can use their voice in everyday communication. The inability of IPAs to understand diverse accents including deaf speech renders them largely inaccessible to non-signing and speaking DHH individuals. Using an Echo Show, we compare the usability of natural language input via spoken English; with Alexa's automatic speech recognition and a Wizard-of-Oz setting with a trained facilitator re-speaking commands against that of a large language model (LLM)-assisted touch interface in a mixed-methods study. The touch method was navigated through an LLM-powered "task prompter," which integrated the user's history and smart environment to suggest contextually-appropriate commands. Quantitative results showed no significant differences across both spoken English conditions vs LLM-assisted touch. Qualitative results showed variability in opinions on the usability of each method. Ultimately, it will be necessary to have robust deaf-accented speech recognized natively by IPAs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15209v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Real-time Facial Communication Restores Cooperation After Defection in Social Dilemmas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15211</link><description>arXiv:2601.15211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial expressions are central to human interaction, yet their role in strategic decision-making has received limited attention. We investigate how real-time facial communication influences cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. In a laboratory experiment, participants play a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game under two conditions: in one, they observe their counterpart's facial expressions via gender-neutral avatars, and in the other no facial cues are available. Using state-of-the-art biometric technology to capture and display emotions in real-time, we find that facial communication significantly increases overall cooperation and, notably, promotes cooperation following defection. This restorative effect suggests that facial expressions help participants interpret defections less harshly, fostering forgiveness and the resumption of cooperation. While past actions remain the strongest predictor of behavior, our findings highlight the communicative power of facial expressions in shaping strategic outcomes. These results offer practical insights for designing emotionally responsive virtual agents and digital platforms that sustain cooperation in the absence of physical presence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15211v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ZENITH: Automated Gradient Norm Informed Stochastic Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15212</link><description>arXiv:2601.15212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training deep computer vision models requires manual oversight or hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate (LR) schedule. While existing adaptive optimizers schedule the LR automatically, they suffer from computational and memory overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal LR choices. In this work, we introduce the ZENITH (Zero-overhead Evolution using Norm-Informed Training History) optimizer, which adapts the LR using the temporal evolution of the gradient norm. Image classification experiments spanning 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks demonstrate that ZENITH achieves higher test accuracy in lower wall-clock time than baselines. It also yielded superior mAP in object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation on MS COCO using the R-CNN family of models. Furthermore, its compatibility with regularization enables even better generalization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15212v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Complete Propositional Dynamic Logic for Regular Expressions with Lookahead</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15214</link><description>arXiv:2601.15214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider (logical) reasoning for regular expressions with lookahead (REwLA). In this paper, we give an axiomatic characterization for both the (match-)language equivalence and the largest substitution-closed equivalence that is sound for the (match-)language equivalence. To achieve this, we introduce a variant of propositional dynamic logic (PDL) on finite linear orders, extended with two operators: the restriction to the identity relation and the restriction to its complement. Our main contribution is a sound and complete Hilbert-style finite axiomatization for the logic, which captures the equivalences of REwLA. Using the extended operators, the completeness is established via a reduction into an identity-free variant of PDL on finite strict linear orders. Moreover, the extended PDL has the same computational complexity as REwLA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15214v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Privacy Collapse: Benign Fine-Tuning Can Break Contextual Privacy in Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15220</link><description>arXiv:2601.15220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a novel phenomenon in language models: benign fine-tuning of frontier models can lead to privacy collapse. We find that diverse, subtle patterns in training data can degrade contextual privacy, including optimisation for helpfulness, exposure to user information, emotional and subjective dialogue, and debugging code printing internal variables, among others. Fine-tuned models lose their ability to reason about contextual privacy norms, share information inappropriately with tools, and violate memory boundaries across contexts. Privacy collapse is a ``silent failure'' because models maintain high performance on standard safety and utility benchmarks whilst exhibiting severe privacy vulnerabilities. Our experiments show evidence of privacy collapse across six models (closed and open weight), five fine-tuning datasets (real-world and controlled data), and two task categories (agentic and memory-based). Our mechanistic analysis reveals that privacy representations are uniquely fragile to fine-tuning, compared to task-relevant features which are preserved. Our results reveal a critical gap in current safety evaluations, in particular for the deployment of specialised agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15220v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ScenDi: 3D-to-2D Scene Diffusion Cascades for Urban Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15221</link><description>arXiv:2601.15221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object generation using diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, but generating realistic 3D urban scenes remains challenging. Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets, Waymo and KITTI-360, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15221v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MonoRace: Winning Champion-Level Drone Racing with Robust Monocular AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15222</link><description>arXiv:2601.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous drone racing represents a major frontier in robotics research. It requires an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can run on board light-weight flying robots under tight resource and time constraints, while pushing the physical system to its limits. The state of the art in this area consists of a system with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that beat human drone racing champions in a controlled indoor environment. Here, we present MonoRace: an onboard drone racing approach that uses a monocular, rolling-shutter camera and IMU that generalizes to a competition environment without any external motion tracking system. The approach features robust state estimation that combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with a drone model. Moreover, it includes an offline optimization procedure that leverages the known geometry of gates to refine any state estimation parameter. This offline optimization is based purely on onboard flight data and is important for fine-tuning the vital external camera calibration parameters. Furthermore, the guidance and control are performed by a neural network that foregoes inner loop controllers by directly sending motor commands. This small network runs on the flight controller at 500Hz. The proposed approach won the 2025 Abu Dhabi Autonomous Drone Racing Competition (A2RL), outperforming all competing AI teams and three human world champion pilots in a direct knockout tournament. It set a new milestone in autonomous drone racing research, reaching speeds up to 100 km/h on the competition track and successfully coping with problems such as camera interference and IMU saturation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15222v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PROGRESSLM: Towards Progress Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15224</link><description>arXiv:2601.15224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating task progress requires reasoning over long-horizon dynamics rather than recognizing static visual content. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations. To this end, we introduce Progress-Bench, a benchmark for systematically evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs. Beyond benchmarking, we further explore a human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach based on curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks. Further analyses reveal characteristic error patterns and clarify when and why progress reasoning succeeds or fails.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15224v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How to Verify a Turing Machine with Dafny</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15230</link><description>arXiv:2601.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the formal verification of two Turing machines using the program verifier Dafny. Both machines are deciders, so we prove total correctness. They are typical first examples of Turing machines used in any course of Theoretical Computer Science; in fact, the second machine is literally taken from a relevant textbook. Usually, the correctness of such machines is made plausible by some informal explanations of their basic ideas, augmented with a few sample executions, but neither by rigorous mathematical nor mechanized formal proof. No wonder: The invariants (and variants) required for such proofs are big artifacts, peppered with overpowering technical details. Finding and checking these artifacts without mechanical support is practically impossible, and such support is only available since recent times. But nowadays, just because of these technicalities, with such subjects under proof a program verifier can really show off and demonstrate its capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Agents Fail: A Comprehensive Study of Bugs in LLM Agents with Automated Labeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15232</link><description>arXiv:2601.15232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent application development. While standalone LLMs cannot perform any actions, LLM agents address the limitation by integrating tools. However, debugging LLM agents is difficult and costly as the field is still in it's early stage and the community is underdeveloped. To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations. For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset. According to our study, we found that BugReAct equipped with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved a remarkable performance in annotating bug characteristics with an average cost of 0.01 USD per post/code snippet.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15232v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tracing 3D Anatomy in 2D Strokes: A Multi-Stage Projection Driven Approach to Cervical Spine Fracture Identification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15235</link><description>arXiv:2601.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cervical spine fractures are critical medical conditions requiring precise and efficient detection for effective clinical management. This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15235v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Metadata Conditioned Large Language Models for Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15236</link><description>arXiv:2601.15236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are typically trained by treating text as a single global distribution, often resulting in geographically homogenized behavior. We study metadata conditioning as a lightweight approach for localization, pre-training 31 models (at 0.5B and 1B parameter scales) from scratch on large-scale English news data annotated with verified URLs, country tags, and continent tags, covering 4 continents and 17 countries. Across four controlled experiments, we show that metadata conditioning consistently improves in-region performance without sacrificing cross-region generalization, enables global models to recover localization comparable to region-specific models, and improves learning efficiency. Our ablation studies demonstrate that URL-level metadata alone captures much of the geographic signal, while balanced regional data coverage remains essential, as metadata cannot fully compensate for missing regions. Finally, we introduce a downstream benchmark of 800 localized news MCQs and show that after instruction tuning, metadata conditioned global models achieve accuracy comparable to LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct, despite being trained on substantially less data. Together, these results establish metadata conditioning as a practical and compute-efficient approach for localization of language models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15236v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] WeDefense: A Toolkit to Defend Against Fake Audio</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15240</link><description>arXiv:2601.15240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of synthetic audio which is perceptually indistinguishable from real, genuine audio. Although this stellar progress enables many positive applications, it also raises risks of misuse, such as for impersonation, disinformation and fraud. Despite a growing number of open-source fake audio detection codes released through numerous challenges and initiatives, most are tailored to specific competitions, datasets or models. A standardized and unified toolkit that supports the fair benchmarking and comparison of competing solutions with not just common databases, protocols, metrics, but also a shared codebase, is missing. To address this, we propose WeDefense, the first open-source toolkit to support both fake audio detection and localization. Beyond model training, WeDefense emphasizes critical yet often overlooked components: flexible input and augmentation, calibration, score fusion, standardized evaluation metrics, and analysis tools for deeper understanding and interpretation. The toolkit is publicly available at https://github.com/zlin0/wedefense with interactive demos for fake audio detection and localization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15240v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Feasibility Preservation under Monotone Retrieval Truncation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15241</link><description>arXiv:2601.15241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-based systems approximate access to a corpus by exposing only a truncated subset of available evidence. Even when relevant information exists in the corpus, truncation can prevent compatible evidence from co-occurring, leading to failures that are not captured by relevance-based evaluation. This paper studies retrieval from a structural perspective, modeling query answering as a feasibility problem under truncation.
  We formalize retrieval as a sequence of candidate evidence sets and characterize conditions under which feasibility in the limit implies feasibility at finite retrieval depth. We show that monotone truncation suffices to guarantee finite witnessability for individual queries. For classes of queries, we identify finite generation of witness certificates as the additional condition required to obtain a uniform retrieval bound, and we show that this condition is necessary. We further exhibit sharp counterexamples demonstrating failure under non-monotone truncation, non-finitely-generated query classes, and purely slotwise coverage.
  Together, these results isolate feasibility preservation as a correctness criterion for retrieval independent of relevance scoring or optimization, and clarify structural limitations inherent to truncation-based retrieval.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15241v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Taxonomy-Aligned Risk Extraction from 10-K Filings with Autonomous Improvement Using LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15247</link><description>arXiv:2601.15247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology for extracting structured risk factors from corporate 10-K filings while maintaining adherence to a predefined hierarchical taxonomy. Our three-stage pipeline combines LLM extraction with supporting quotes, embedding-based semantic mapping to taxonomy categories, and LLM-as-a-judge validation that filters spurious assignments. To evaluate our approach, we extract 10,688 risk factors from S&amp;amp;P 500 companies and examine risk profile similarity across industry clusters. Beyond extraction, we introduce autonomous taxonomy maintenance where an AI agent analyzes evaluation feedback to identify problematic categories, diagnose failure patterns, and propose refinements, achieving 104.7% improvement in embedding separation in a case study. External validation confirms the taxonomy captures economically meaningful structure: same-industry companies exhibit 63% higher risk profile similarity than cross-industry pairs (Cohen's d=1.06, AUC 0.82, p&lt;0.001). The methodology generalizes to any domain requiring taxonomy-aligned extraction from unstructured text, with autonomous improvement enabling continuous quality maintenance and enhancement as systems process more documents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15247v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FlowSSC: Universal Generative Monocular Semantic Scene Completion via One-Step Latent Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15250</link><description>arXiv:2601.15250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity of inferring occluded 3D geometry from a single view. While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15250v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Effect of Scripts and Formats on LLM Numeracy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15251</link><description>arXiv:2601.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive proficiency in basic arithmetic, rivaling human-level performance on standard numerical tasks. However, little attention has been given to how these models perform when numerical expressions deviate from the prevailing conventions present in their training corpora. In this work, we investigate numerical reasoning across a wide range of numeral scripts and formats. We show that LLM accuracy drops substantially when numerical inputs are rendered in underrepresented scripts or formats, despite the underlying mathematical reasoning being identical. We further demonstrate that targeted prompting strategies, such as few-shot prompting and explicit numeral mapping, can greatly narrow this gap. Our findings highlight an overlooked challenge in multilingual numerical reasoning and provide actionable insights for working with LLMs to reliably interpret, manipulate, and generate numbers across diverse numeral scripts and formatting styles.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15251v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DrivIng: A Large-Scale Multimodal Driving Dataset with Full Digital Twin Integration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15260</link><description>arXiv:2601.15260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception is a cornerstone of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to understand their surroundings and make safe, reliable decisions. Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing. To support reproducible research and robust validation, we benchmark DrivIng with state-of-the-art perception models and publicly release the dataset, digital twin, HD map, and codebase.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15260v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluation of Large Language Models in Legal Applications: Challenges, Methods, and Future Directions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15267</link><description>arXiv:2601.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly integrated into legal applications, including judicial decision support, legal practice assistance, and public-facing legal services. While LLMs show strong potential in handling legal knowledge and tasks, their deployment in real-world legal settings raises critical concerns beyond surface-level accuracy, involving the soundness of legal reasoning processes and trustworthy issues such as fairness and reliability. Systematic evaluation of LLM performance in legal tasks has therefore become essential for their responsible adoption. This survey identifies key challenges in evaluating LLMs for legal tasks grounded in real-world legal practice. We analyze the major difficulties involved in assessing LLM performance in the legal domain, including outcome correctness, reasoning reliability, and trustworthiness. Building on these challenges, we review and categorize existing evaluation methods and benchmarks according to their task design, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We further discuss the extent to which current approaches address these challenges, highlight their limitations, and outline future research directions toward more realistic, reliable, and legally grounded evaluation frameworks for LLMs in legal domains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15267v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Lightweight LLMs for Network Attack Detection in IoT Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15269</link><description>arXiv:2601.15269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has increased the scale and diversity of cyberattacks, exposing limitations in traditional intrusion detection systems. Classical machine learning (ML) models such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine perform well on known attacks but require retraining to detect unseen or zero-day threats. This study investigates lightweight decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) for IoT attack detection by integrating structured-to-text conversion, Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Network traffic features are transformed into compact natural-language prompts, enabling efficient adaptation under constrained hardware. Experiments on the CICIoT2023 dataset show that a QLoRA-tuned LLaMA-1B model achieves an F1-score of 0.7124, comparable to the Random Forest (RF) baseline (0.7159) for known attacks. With RAG, the system attains 42.63% accuracy on unseen attack types without additional training, demonstrating practical zero-shot capability. These results highlight the potential of retrieval-enhanced lightweight LLMs as adaptable and resource-efficient solutions for next-generation IoT intrusion detection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15269v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RayRoPE: Projective Ray Positional Encoding for Multi-view Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15275</link><description>arXiv:2601.15275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study positional encodings for multi-view transformers that process tokens from a set of posed input images, and seek a mechanism that encodes patches uniquely, allows SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and can be adaptive to the geometry of the underlying scene. We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15275v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Fake News Detection using Large Language Models under Adversarial Sentiment Attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15277</link><description>arXiv:2601.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation and fake news have become a pressing societal challenge, driving the need for reliable automated detection methods. Prior research has highlighted sentiment as an important signal in fake news detection, either by analyzing which sentiments are associated with fake news or by using sentiment and emotion features for classification. However, this poses a vulnerability since adversaries can manipulate sentiment to evade detectors especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs). A few studies have explored adversarial samples generated by LLMs, but they mainly focus on stylistic features such as writing style of news publishers. Thus, the crucial vulnerability of sentiment manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art fake news detectors under sentiment manipulation. We introduce AdSent, a sentiment-robust detection framework designed to ensure consistent veracity predictions across both original and sentiment-altered news articles. Specifically, we (1) propose controlled sentiment-based adversarial attacks using LLMs, (2) analyze the impact of sentiment shifts on detection performance. We show that changing the sentiment heavily impacts the performance of fake news detection models, indicating biases towards neutral articles being real, while non-neutral articles are often classified as fake content. (3) We introduce a novel sentiment-agnostic training strategy that enhances robustness against such perturbations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdSent significantly outperforms competitive baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while also generalizing effectively to unseen datasets and adversarial scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15277v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Interpreting Multimodal Communication at Scale in Short-Form Video: Visual, Audio, and Textual Mental Health Discourse on TikTok</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15278</link><description>arXiv:2601.15278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-form video platforms integrate text, visuals, and audio into complex communicative acts, yet existing research analyzes these modalities in isolation, lacking scalable frameworks to interpret their joint contributions. This study introduces a pipeline combining automated multimodal feature extraction with Shapley value-based interpretability to analyze how text, visuals, and audio jointly influence engagement. Applying this framework to 162,965 TikTok videos and 814,825 images about social anxiety disorder (SAD), we find that facial expressions outperform textual sentiment in predicting viewership, informational content drives more attention than emotional support, and cross-modal synergies exhibit threshold-dependent effects. These findings demonstrate how multimodal analysis reveals interaction patterns invisible to single-modality approaches. Methodologically, we contribute a reproducible framework for interpretable multimodal research applicable across domains; substantively, we advance understanding of mental health communication in algorithmically mediated environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15278v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MolecularIQ: Characterizing Chemical Reasoning Capabilities Through Symbolic Verification on Molecular Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15279</link><description>arXiv:2601.15279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A molecule's properties are fundamentally determined by its composition and structure encoded in its molecular graph. Thus, reasoning about molecular properties requires the ability to parse and understand the molecular graph. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to chemistry, tackling tasks such as molecular name conversion, captioning, text-guided generation, and property or reaction prediction. Most existing benchmarks emphasize general chemical knowledge, rely on literature or surrogate labels that risk leakage or bias, or reduce evaluation to multiple-choice questions. We introduce MolecularIQ, a molecular structure reasoning benchmark focused exclusively on symbolically verifiable tasks. MolecularIQ enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning over molecular graphs and reveals capability patterns that localize model failures to specific tasks and molecular structures. This provides actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current chemistry LLMs and guides the development of models that reason faithfully over molecular structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15279v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM-based Multimodal Feedback Produces Equivalent Learning and Better Student Perceptions than Educator Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15280</link><description>arXiv:2601.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing timely, targeted, and multimodal feedback helps students quickly correct errors, build deep understanding and stay motivated, yet making it at scale remains a challenge. This study introduces a real-time AI-facilitated multimodal feedback system that integrates structured textual explanations with dynamic multimedia resources, including the retrieved most relevant slide page references and streaming AI audio narration. In an online crowdsourcing experiment, we compared this system against fixed business-as-usual feedback by educators across three dimensions: (1) learning effectiveness, (2) learner engagement, (3) perceived feedback quality and value. Results showed that AI multimodal feedback achieved learning gains equivalent to original educator feedback while significantly outperforming it on perceived clarity, specificity, conciseness, motivation, satisfaction, and reducing cognitive load, with comparable correctness, trust, and acceptance. Process logs revealed distinct engagement patterns: for multiple-choice questions, educator feedback encouraged more submissions; for open-ended questions, AI-facilitated targeted suggestions lowered revision barriers and promoted iterative improvement. These findings highlight the potential of AI multimodal feedback to provide scalable, real-time, and context-aware support that both reduces instructor workload and enhances student experience.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15280v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StableWorld: Towards Stable and Consistent Long Interactive Video Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15281</link><description>arXiv:2601.15281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the overlooked challenge of stability and temporal consistency in interactive video generation, which synthesizes dynamic and controllable video worlds through interactive behaviors such as camera movements and text prompts. Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15281v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking Video Generation Model for the Embodied World</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15282</link><description>arXiv:2601.15282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15282v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LuxRemix: Lighting Decomposition and Remixing for Indoor Scenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15283</link><description>arXiv:2601.15283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for interactive light editing in indoor scenes from a single multi-view scene capture. Our method leverages a generative image-based light decomposition model that factorizes complex indoor scene illumination into its constituent light sources. This factorization enables independent manipulation of individual light sources, specifically allowing control over their state (on/off), chromaticity, and intensity. We further introduce multi-view lighting harmonization to ensure consistent propagation of the lighting decomposition across all scene views. This is integrated into a relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation, providing real-time interactive control over the individual light sources. Our results demonstrate highly photorealistic lighting decomposition and relighting outcomes across diverse indoor scenes. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets and provide a quantitative and qualitative comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: What if a video generation model could not only imagine a plausible future, but the correct one, accurately reflecting how the world changes with each action? We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Iterative Refinement Improves Compositional Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15286</link><description>arXiv:2601.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results for a variety of tasks, but state-of-the-art systems require fast GPUs with large amounts of memory. To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

Abstract: Modern socio-technical systems increasingly involve multi-stakeholder environments where actors simultaneously cooperate and compete. These coopetitive relationships exhibit dynamic trust evolution based on observed behavior over repeated interactions. While conceptual modeling languages like i* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational mechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence. Conversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide algorithmic updating but lack grounding in conceptual models that capture strategic dependencies covering mixed motives of actors. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a computational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic coopetition with dynamic trust evolution. Building on companion work that achieved 58/60 validation (96.7%) for logarithmic specifications, we introduce trust as a two-layer system with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation tracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating hysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We develop a structured translation framework enabling practitioners to instantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks encompassing mixed motives of actors. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125 parameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias, hysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification. Empirical validation using the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49/60 validation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution across five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.24909v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic-R: Learning to Retrieve for Agentic Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11888</link><description>arXiv:2601.11888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic search has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm, where an agent interleaves multi-step reasoning with on-demand retrieval to solve complex questions. Despite its success, how to design a retriever for agentic search remains largely underexplored. Existing search agents typically rely on similarity-based retrievers, while similar passages are not always useful for final answer generation. In this paper, we propose a novel retriever training framework tailored for agentic search. Unlike retrievers designed for single-turn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that only rely on local passage utility, we propose to use both local query-passage relevance and global answer correctness to measure passage utility in a multi-turn agentic search. We further introduce an iterative training strategy, where the search agent and the retriever are optimized bidirectionally and iteratively. Different from RAG retrievers that are only trained once with fixed questions, our retriever is continuously improved using evolving and higher-quality queries from the agent. Extensive experiments on seven single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that our retriever, termed \ours{}, consistently outperforms strong baselines across different search agents.

Abstract: Eigenvalue transformations appear ubiquitously in scientific computation, ranging from matrix polynomials to differential equations, and are beyond the reach of the quantum singular value transformation framework. In this work, we study the efficiency of quantum algorithms based on contour integral representation for eigenvalue transformations from both theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretically, we establish a complete complexity analysis of the contour integral approach proposed in [Takahira, Ohashi, Sogabe, and Usuda. Quant. Inf. Comput., 22, 11\&amp;12, 965--979 (2021)]. Moreover, we combine the contour integral approach and the sampling-based linear combination of unitaries to propose a quantum algorithm for estimating observables of eigenvalue transformations using only $3$ additional qubits. Practically, we design contour integral based quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation, matrix polynomials, and solving linear ordinary differential equations, and show that the contour integral algorithm can outperform all the existing quantum algorithms in the case of solving asymptotically stable differential equations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Synthetic Singers: A Review of Deep-Learning-based Singing Voice Synthesis Approaches</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13910</link><description>arXiv:2601.13910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in singing voice synthesis (SVS) have attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. With the advent of large language models and novel generative paradigms, producing controllable, high-fidelity singing voices has become an attainable goal. Yet the field still lacks a comprehensive survey that systematically analyzes deep-learning-based singing voice synthesis systems and their enabling technologies.

Moreover, we provide an in-depth analysis of core technologies, covering singing modeling and control techniques. Finally, we review relevant datasets, annotation tools, and evaluation benchmarks that support training and assessment. In appendix, we introduce training strategies and further discussion of SVS.

Abstract: Reaching consensus on massive discussion networks is critical for reducing noise and achieving optimal collective outcomes. However, the natural tendency of humans to preserve their initial ideas constrains the emergence of global solutions. To address this, Collective Intelligence (CI) platforms facilitate the discovery of globally superior solutions. We introduce a dynamical system based on the standard $O(N)$ model to drive the aggregation of semantically similar ideas. The system consists of users represented as nodes in a $d=2$ lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions, where their ideas are represented by semantic vectors computed with a pretrained embedding model. We analyze the system's equilibrium states as a function of the coupling parameter $\beta$. Our results show that $\beta &gt; 0$ drives the system toward a ferromagnetic-like phase (global consensus), while $\beta &lt; 0$ induces an antiferromagnetic-like state (maximum dissent), where users maximize semantic distance from their neighbors. This framework offers a controllable method for managing the tradeoff between cohesion and diversity in CI platforms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13932v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On Meta-Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14262</link><description>arXiv:2601.14262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluation is the foundation of empirical science, yet the evaluation of evaluation itself -- so-called meta-evaluation -- remains strikingly underdeveloped. While methods such as observational studies, design of experiments (DoE), and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shaped modern scientific practice, there has been little systematic inquiry into their comparative validity and utility across domains. Here we introduce a formal framework for meta-evaluation by defining the evaluation space, its structured representation, and a benchmark we call AxiaBench. AxiaBench enables the first large-scale, quantitative comparison of ten widely used evaluation methods across eight representative application domains. Our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation: no existing method simultaneously achieves accuracy and efficiency across diverse scenarios, with DoE and observational designs in particular showing significant deviations from real-world ground truth. We further evaluate a unified method of entire-space stratified sampling from previous evaluatology research, and the results report that it consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tested domains. These results establish meta-evaluation as a scientific object in its own right and provide both a conceptual foundation and a pragmatic tool set for advancing trustworthy evaluation in computational and experimental research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14262v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DeepInflation: an AI agent for research and model discovery of inflation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14288</link><description>arXiv:2601.14288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \textbf{DeepInflation}, an AI agent designed for research and model discovery in inflationary cosmology.

Abstract: According to the latest provisional statistics released by the UK Department for Transport, Great Britain recorded 1,633 road deaths in 2024, representing a slight increase from 2023 and raising concerns about safety progress, which indicates that preventable fatalities remain a challenge. The deployment of advanced mobility systems, even certified and safety-assessed, is not sufficient to deliver improved safety outcomes, and existing road infrastructure is not sufficiently equipped to prevent severe collisions. Successful application of the ``Safe System'' approach demands systems thinking in an integrated and holistic manner, encompassing all aspects of road safety. This paper argues that road safety must be managed as a complex socio-technical system where risk evolves dynamically and must be continuously monitored. To address these safety gaps, we propose a systems thinking approach that identifies factors contributing to fatal outcomes and mitigates them. The framework consists of four steps: 1) List stakeholders who influence road safety, 2) Model the interactions between these stakeholders, 3) List assumptions that might be identified as factors for fatalities, and 4) Monitor these assumptions throughout the system lifecycle. The approach is applied to the United Kingdom (UK) road network to demonstrate feasibility. The study provides actionable guidance and new KPIs categories for stakeholders to implement road safety monitoring and eliminate any unreasonable road safety risks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14292v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Assessing the livability within the 15-minute city concept based on mobile phone data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14307</link><description>arXiv:2601.14307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many cities promote walkability through concepts such as the compact city and 15-minute city to enhance urban livability, yet few methods link spatial walkability features to empirically measured livability and account for temporal dynamics. The method developed for this study uses mobile phone data from the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Finland) to assess whether commonly used, literature-derived livability indicators (diversity, density, proximity, accessibility) predict observed human activity patterns across different times of day.
  We constructed two key dimensions of livability: attractiveness and walkability with quantifiable sub-indicators that were selected based on literature. Our analysis shows that walkability, and even more so the combined livability index, correlates with activity patterns, outperforming the pure attractiveness perspective. However, this relationship is temporally unstable, significantly weakening at night and fluctuating daily. Moreover, based on Geographically Weighted Regression analysis, our results reveal significant spatial variation in the relationship between livability and the intensity of human activities. The findings suggest that traditional urban planning goals, such as functional diversity to enhance walkability, contribute to livability but have a limited impact on the 15-minute city's overall sustainable mobility objectives, necessitating a larger-scale perspective and more functionally profiled approaches for urban development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14307v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Self-Supervised Score-Based Despeckling for SAR Imagery via Log-Domain Transformation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14334</link><description>arXiv:2601.14334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The speckle noise inherent in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery significantly degrades image quality and complicates subsequent analysis. Given that SAR speckle is multiplicative and Gamma-distributed, effectively despeckling SAR imagery remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel self-supervised framework for SAR image despeckling based on score-based generative models operating in the transformed log domain. We first transform the data into the log-domain and then convert the speckle noise residuals into an approximately additive Gaussian distribution. This step enables the application of score-based models, which are trained in the transformed domain using a self-supervised objective. This objective allows our model to learn the clean underlying signal by training on further corrupted versions of the input data itself. Consequently, our method exhibits significantly shorter inference times compared to many existing self-supervised techniques, offering a robust and practical solution for SAR image restoration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration with Local-Global Attention and Image Decomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14337</link><description>arXiv:2601.14337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable image registration is a critical technology in medical image analysis, with broad applications in clinical practice such as disease diagnosis, multi-modal fusion, and surgical navigation. Traditional methods often rely on iterative optimization, which is computationally intensive and lacks generalizability. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced attention-based mechanisms that improve feature alignment, yet accurately registering regions with high anatomical variability remains challenging. In this study, we proposed a novel unsupervised deformable image registration framework, LGANet++, which employs a novel local-global attention mechanism integrated with a unique technique for feature interaction and fusion to enhance registration accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. We evaluated our approach using five publicly available datasets, representing three distinct registration scenarios: cross-patient, cross-time, and cross-modal CT-MR registration. The results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art registration methods, improving registration accuracy by 1.39% in cross-patient registration, 0.71% in cross-time registration, and 6.12% in cross-modal CT-MR registration tasks. These results underscore the potential of LGANet++ to support clinical workflows requiring reliable and efficient image registration.

Abstract: Image segmentation is pivotal in medical image analysis, facilitating clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease evaluation. Deep learning has significantly advanced automatic segmentation methodologies by providing superior modeling capability for complex structures and fine-grained anatomical regions. However, medical images often suffer from data imbalance issues, such as large volume disparities among organs or tissues, and uneven sample distributions across different anatomical structures. This imbalance tends to bias the model toward larger organs or more frequently represented structures, while overlooking smaller or less represented structures, thereby affecting the segmentation accuracy and robustness. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel contour-weighted segmentation approach, which improves the model's capability to represent small and underrepresented structures. We developed PDANet, a lightweight and efficient segmentation network based on a partial decoder mechanism. We evaluated our method using three prominent public datasets. The experimental results show that our methodology excelled in three distinct tasks: segmenting multiple abdominal organs, brain tumors, and pelvic bone fragments with injuries. It consistently outperformed nine state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed contour-weighted strategy improved segmentation for other comparison methods across the three datasets, yielding average enhancements in Dice scores of 2.32%, 1.67%, and 3.60%, respectively. These results demonstrate that our contour-weighted segmentation method surpassed current leading approaches in both accuracy and robustness. As a model-independent strategy, it can seamlessly fit various segmentation frameworks, enhancing their performance. This flexibility highlighted its practical importance and potential for broad use in medical image analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14338v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VCSEL-based CPO for Scale-Up in A.I.

Abstract: The drastic increase of bandwidth demands in AI datacenters requires new solutions with low power consumption and high bandwidth densities. Further increasing the total bandwidth with copper interconnects is challenging, thus it is crucial to introduce optics into the scale-up network. For this purpose, the most important metrics are the energy efficiency of the total link in addition to the spatial bandwidth-density and reach. With the inefficiency of copper traces at high speeds, transitioning to co-packaged optics is no longer optional but essential. Here, we show that the mature VCSEL technology offers the ideal combination of low-cost, low-latency, high-reliability, and energy efficiency at all bitrates, thanks to their unique versatility and high wall-plug-efficiency.

Abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of probabilistic diffusion models to reduce dramatically the computational cost of expensive hydrodynamical simulations to study the relationship between observable baryonic cosmological probes and dark matter at field level and well into the non-linear regime. We introduce a novel technique, Cosmo-FOLD (Cosmological Fields via Overlap Latent Diffusion) to rapidly generate accurate and arbitrarily large cosmological and astrophysical 3-dimensional fields, conditioned on a given input field. We are able to generate TNG300-2 dark matter density and gas temperature fields from a model trained only on ~1% of the volume (a process we refer to as `upscaling'), reproducing both large scale coherent dark matter filaments and power spectra to within 10% for wavenumbers k &lt;= 5 h Mpc^-1. These results are obtained within a small fraction of the original simulation cost and produced on a single GPU. Beyond one and two points statistics, the bispectrum is also faithfully reproduced through the inclusion of positional encodings. Finally, we demonstrate Cosmo-FOLD's generalisation capabilities by upscaling a CAMELS volume of 25 (Mpc h^-1)^3 to a full TNG300-2 volume of 205 (Mpc h^-1)^3$ with no fine-tuning. Cosmo-FOLD opens the door to full field-level simulation-based inference on cosmological scale.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14377v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] $\pi$MPC: A Parallel-in-horizon and Construction-free NMPC Solver</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14414</link><description>arXiv:2601.14414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has gained increasing popularity in embedded model predictive control (MPC) due to its code simplicity and pain-free parameter selection. However, existing ADMM solvers either target general quadratic programming (QP) problems or exploit sparse MPC formulations via Riccati recursions, which are inherently sequential and therefore difficult to parallelize for long prediction horizons. This technical note proposes a novel \textit{parallel-in-horizon} and \textit{construction-free} nonlinear MPC algorithm, termed $\pi$MPC, which combines a new variable-splitting scheme with a velocity-based system representation in the ADMM framework, enabling horizon-wise parallel execution while operating directly on system matrices without explicit MPC-to-QP construction. Numerical experiments and accompanying code are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14414v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Event-Triggered Newton Extremum Seeking for Multivariable Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14416</link><description>arXiv:2601.14416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a static event-triggered control strategy for multivariable Newton-based extremum seeking. The proposed method integrates event-triggered actuation into the Newton-based optimization framework to reduce control updates while maintaining rapid convergence to the extremum. Unlike traditional gradient-based extremum seeking, where the convergence rate depends on the unknown Hessian of the cost function, the proposed approach employs a dynamic estimator of the Hessian inverse, formulated as a Riccati equation, enabling user-assignable convergence rates. The event-triggering mechanism is designed to minimize unnecessary actuation updates while preserving stability and performance. Using averaging theory, we establish local stability results and exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the unknown extremum point. Additionally, numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach over gradient-based and continuously actuated Newton-based extremum seeking, showing improved convergence rates and reduced control update frequency, leading to more efficient implementation in real-time optimization scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14416v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Meta Flow Maps enable scalable reward alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14430</link><description>arXiv:2601.14430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling generative models is computationally expensive. This is because optimal alignment with a reward function--whether via inference-time steering or fine-tuning--requires estimating the value function. This task demands access to the conditional posterior $p_{1|t}(x_1|x_t)$, the distribution of clean data $x_1$ consistent with an intermediate state $x_t$, a requirement that typically compels methods to resort to costly trajectory simulations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Meta Flow Maps (MFMs), a framework extending consistency models and flow maps into the stochastic regime. MFMs are trained to perform stochastic one-step posterior sampling, generating arbitrarily many i.i.d. draws of clean data $x_1$ from any intermediate state. Crucially, these samples provide a differentiable reparametrization that unlocks efficient value function estimation. We leverage this capability to solve bottlenecks in both paradigms: enabling inference-time steering without inner rollouts, and facilitating unbiased, off-policy fine-tuning to general rewards. Empirically, our single-particle steered-MFM sampler outperforms a Best-of-1000 baseline on ImageNet across multiple rewards at a fraction of the compute.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Super-resolution by Adaptive Non-local Observables</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14433</link><description>arXiv:2601.14433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) seeks to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) data from low-resolution (LR) observations. Classical deep learning methods have advanced SR substantially, but require increasingly deeper networks, large datasets, and heavy computation to capture fine-grained correlations. In this work, we present the \emph{first study} to investigate quantum circuits for SR. We propose a framework based on Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with \emph{Adaptive Non-Local Observable} (ANO) measurements. Unlike conventional VQCs with fixed Pauli readouts, ANO introduces trainable multi-qubit Hermitian observables, allowing the measurement process to adapt during training. This design leverages the high-dimensional Hilbert space of quantum systems and the representational structure provided by entanglement and superposition. Experiments demonstrate that ANO-VQCs achieve up to five-fold higher resolution with a relatively small model size, suggesting a promising new direction at the intersection of quantum machine learning and super-resolution.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Wasteful is Signaling?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14454</link><description>arXiv:2601.14454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signaling is wasteful. But how wasteful? We study the fraction of surplus dissipated in a separating equilibrium. For isoelastic environments, this waste ratio has a simple formula: $\beta/(\beta+\sigma)$, where $\beta$ is the benefit elasticity (reward to higher perception) and $\sigma$ is the elasticity of higher types' relative cost advantage. The ratio is constant across types and independent of other parameters, including convexity of cost in the signal. A constant waste ratio characterizes the isoelastic class. In winner-take-all signaling tournaments with $N$ candidates, exactly $(N-1)/N$ of the surplus dissipates -- the same as in Tullock contests.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14454v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Data Limits of Laplace Learning for Gaussian Measure Data in Infinite Dimensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14515</link><description>arXiv:2601.14515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laplace learning is a semi-supervised method, a solution for finding missing labels from a partially labeled dataset utilizing the geometry given by the unlabeled data points. The method minimizes a Dirichlet energy defined on a (discrete) graph constructed from the full dataset. In finite dimensions the asymptotics in the large (unlabeled) data limit are well understood with convergence from the graph setting to a continuum Sobolev semi-norm weighted by the Lebesgue density of the data-generating measure. The lack of the Lebesgue measure on infinite-dimensional spaces requires rethinking the analysis if the data aren't finite-dimensional. In this paper we make a first step in this direction by analyzing the setting when the data are generated by a Gaussian measure on a Hilbert space and proving pointwise convergence of the graph Dirichlet energy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14515v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards noise-robust speech inversion through multi-task learning with speech enhancement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14516</link><description>arXiv:2601.14516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Self Supervised Learning (SSL) speech representations for Speech Inversion (SI). However, applying SI in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to the pervasive presence of background noise. We propose a unified framework that integrates Speech Enhancement (SE) and SI models through shared SSL-based speech representations. In this framework, the SSL model is trained not only to support the SE module in suppressing noise but also to produce representations that are more informative for the SI task, allowing both modules to benefit from joint training. At a Signal-to-Noise Ratio of -5 db, our method for the SI task achieves relative improvements over the baseline of 80.95% under babble noise and 38.98% under non-babble noise, as measured by the average Pearson product-moment correlation across all estimated parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14516v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaling Ambiguity: Augmenting Human Annotation in Speech Emotion Recognition with Audio-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14620</link><description>arXiv:2601.14620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition models typically use single categorical labels, overlooking the inherent ambiguity of human emotions. Ambiguous Emotion Recognition addresses this by representing emotions as probability distributions, but progress is limited by unreliable ground-truth distributions inferred from sparse human annotations. This paper explores whether Large Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can mitigate the annotation bottleneck by generating high-quality synthetic annotations. We introduce a framework leveraging ALMs to create Synthetic Perceptual Proxies, augmenting human annotations to improve ground-truth distribution reliability. We validate these proxies through statistical analysis of their alignment with human distributions and evaluate their impact by fine-tuning ALMs with the augmented emotion distributions. Furthermore, to address class imbalance and enable unbiased evaluation, we propose DiME-Aug, a Distribution-aware Multimodal Emotion Augmentation strategy. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show that synthetic annotations enhance emotion distribution, especially in low-ambiguity regions where annotation agreement is high. However, benefits diminish for highly ambiguous emotions with greater human disagreement. This work provides the first evidence that ALMs could address annotation scarcity in ambiguous emotion recognition, but highlights the need for more advanced prompting or generation strategies to handle highly ambiguous cases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14620v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Online Linear Programming with Replenishment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14629</link><description>arXiv:2601.14629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an online linear programming (OLP) model in which inventory is not provided upfront but instead arrives gradually through an exogenous stochastic replenishment process. This replenishment-based formulation captures operational settings, such as e-commerce fulfillment, perishable supply chains, and renewable-powered systems, where resources are accumulated gradually and initial inventories are small or zero. The introduction of dispersed, uncertain replenishment fundamentally alters the structure of classical OLPs, creating persistent stockout risk and eliminating advance knowledge of the total budget.
  We develop new algorithms and regret analyses for three major distributional regimes studied in the OLP literature: bounded distributions, finite-support distributions, and continuous-support distributions with a non-degeneracy condition. For bounded distributions, we design an algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. For finite-support distributions with a non-degenerate induced LP, we obtain $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret, and we establish an $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for degenerate instances, demonstrating a sharp separation from the classical setting where $\mathcal{O}(1)$ regret is achievable. For continuous-support, non-degenerate distributions, we develop a two-stage accumulate-then-convert algorithm that achieves $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$ regret, comparable to the $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret in classical OLPs. Together, these results provide a near-complete characterization of the optimal regret achievable in OLP with replenishment. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithms and demonstrate their advantages over natural adaptations of classical OLP methods in the replenishment setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14629v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semi-Supervised Mixture Models under the Concept of Missing at Radom with Margin Confidence and Aranda Ordaz Function</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14631</link><description>arXiv:2601.14631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised learning framework for Gaussian mixture modelling under a Missing at Random (MAR) mechanism. The method explicitly parameterizes the missingness mechanism by modelling the probability of missingness as a function of classification uncertainty. To quantify classification uncertainty, we introduce margin confidence and incorporate the Aranda Ordaz (AO) link function to flexibly capture the asymmetric relationships between uncertainty and missing probability. Based on this formulation, we develop an efficient Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm that jointly estimates all parameters appearing in both the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the missingness mechanism, and subsequently imputes the missing labels by a Bayesian classifier derived from the fitted mixture model. This method effectively alleviates the bias induced by ignoring the missingness mechanism while enhancing the robustness of semi-supervised learning. The resulting uncertainty-aware framework delivers reliable classification performance in realistic MAR scenarios with substantial proportions of missing labels.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14631v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TRSVR: An Adaptive Stochastic Trust-Region Method with Variance Reduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14647</link><description>arXiv:2601.14647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic trust-region method for unconstrained nonconvex optimization that incorporates stochastic variance-reduced gradients (SVRG) to accelerate convergence. Unlike classical trust-region methods, the proposed algorithm relies solely on stochastic gradient information and does not require function value evaluations. The trust-region radius is adaptively adjusted based on a radius-control parameter and the stochastic gradient estimate. Under mild assumptions, we establish that the algorithm converges in expectation to a first-order stationary point. Moreover, the method achieves iteration and sample complexity bounds that match those of SVRG-based first-order methods, while allowing stochastic and potentially gradient-dependent second-order information. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that incorporating SVRG accelerates convergence, and that the use of trust-region methods and Hessian information further improves performance. We also highlight the impact of batch size and inner-loop length on efficiency, and show that the proposed method outperforms SGD and Adam on several machine learning tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14647v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Fidelity Estimation for Quantum Programs with Graph-Guided Noise Awareness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14713</link><description>arXiv:2601.14713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fidelity estimation is a critical yet resource-intensive step in testing quantum programs on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, where the required number of measurements is difficult to predefine due to hardware noise, device heterogeneity, and transpilation-induced circuit transformations. We present QuFid, an adaptive and noise-aware framework that determines measurement budgets online by leveraging circuit structure and runtime statistical feedback. QuFid models a quantum program as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and employs a control-flow-aware random walk to characterize noise propagation along gate dependencies. Backend-specific effects are captured via transpilation-induced structural deformation metrics, which are integrated into the random-walk formulation to induce a noise-propagation operator. Circuit complexity is then quantified through the spectral characteristics of this operator, providing a principled and lightweight basis for adaptive measurement planning. Experiments on 18 quantum benchmarks executed on IBM Quantum backends show that QuFid significantly reduces measurement cost compared to fixed-shot and learning-based baselines, while consistently maintaining acceptable fidelity bias.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14713v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AQAScore: Evaluating Semantic Alignment in Text-to-Audio Generation via Audio Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14728</link><description>arXiv:2601.14728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although text-to-audio generation has made remarkable progress in realism and diversity, the development of evaluation metrics has not kept pace. Widely-adopted approaches, typically based on embedding similarity like CLAPScore, effectively measure general relevance but remain limited in fine-grained semantic alignment and compositional reasoning. To address this, we introduce AQAScore, a backbone-agnostic evaluation framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of audio-aware large language models (ALLMs). AQAScore reformulates assessment as a probabilistic semantic verification task; rather than relying on open-ended text generation, it estimates alignment by computing the exact log-probability of a "Yes" answer to targeted semantic queries. We evaluate AQAScore across multiple benchmarks, including human-rated relevance, pairwise comparison, and compositional reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that AQAScore consistently achieves higher correlation with human judgments than similarity-based metrics and generative prompting baselines, showing its effectiveness in capturing subtle semantic inconsistencies and scaling with the capability of underlying ALLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14728v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On Distributed Quantum Computing with Distributed Fan-Out Operations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14734</link><description>arXiv:2601.14734v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: This study investigates the mathematical existence and asymptotic properties of Ulanowicz's structural resilience in complex systems such as supply chain networks. While ecological evidence suggests that sustainable systems gravitate toward an optimal state at $\alpha = 1/\mathrm{e}$, the universality of this configuration in generalized networks remains theoretically unverified. We prove that while optimal resilience is unattainable in two-node networks due to structural over-determinacy, it exists for any directed graph with $N_\mathcal{V} \geq 3$. By constructing a symmetric network model with three types of link weights $(x, y, z)$ and uniform marginal distributions, we derive the governing equations for the optimal resilience configuration. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that as the network size $N_\mathcal{V}$ increases, the link weights required to maintain optimal resilience exhibit a power-law scaling behavior: the adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-1})$, while the non-adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-2})$, both accompanied by specific logarithmic corrections. This work establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for the optimal resilience framework and provides a unified perspective on how entropy-based principles govern the robustness and evolution of large-scale complex networks, which may offer quantitative guidance for designing large-scale networked systems under robustness constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning and extrapolating scale-invariant processes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14810</link><description>arXiv:2601.14810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14810v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Finite-Sample Inference for Sparsely Permuted Linear Regression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14872</link><description>arXiv:2601.14872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a noisy linear observation model with an unknown permutation called permuted/shuffled linear regression, where responses and covariates are mismatched and the permutation forms a discrete, factorial-size parameter. This unknown permutation is a key component of the data-generating process, yet its statistical investigation remains challenging due to its discrete nature. In this study, we develop a general statistical inference framework on the permutation and regression coefficients. First, we introduce a localization step that reduces the permutation space to a small candidate set building on recent advances in the repro samples method, whose miscoverage decays polynomially with the number of Monte Carlo samples. Then, based on this localized set, we provide statistical inference procedures: a conditional Monte Carlo test of permutation structures with valid finite-sample Type-I error control. We also develop coefficient inference that remains valid under alignment uncertainty of permutations. For computational purposes, we develop a linear assignment problem computable in polynomial time complexity and demonstrate that its solution asymptotically converges to that of the conventional least squares problem with large computational cost. Extensions to partially permuted designs and ridge regularization are also discussed. Extensive simulations and an application to Beijing air-quality data corroborate finite-sample validity, strong power to detect mismatches, and practical scalability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14872v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ExoMiner++ 2.0: Vetting TESS Full-Frame Image Transit Signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14877</link><description>arXiv:2601.14877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Full-Frame Images (FFIs) provide photometric time series for millions of stars, enabling transit searches beyond the limited set of pre-selected 2-minute targets. However, FFIs present additional challenges for transit identification and vetting. In this work, we apply ExoMiner++ 2.0, an adaptation of the ExoMiner++ framework originally developed for TESS 2-minute data, to FFI light curves. The model is used to perform large-scale planet versus non-planet classification of Threshold Crossing Events across the sectors analyzed in this study. We construct a uniform vetting catalog of all evaluated signals and assess model performance under different observing conditions. We find that ExoMiner++ 2.0 generalizes effectively to the FFI domain, providing robust discrimination between planetary signals, astrophysical false positives, and instrumental artifacts despite the limitations inherent to longer cadence data. This work extends the applicability of ExoMiner++ to the full TESS dataset and supports future population studies and follow-up prioritization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14877v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fast-ULCNet: A fast and ultra low complexity network for single-channel speech enhancement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14925</link><description>arXiv:2601.14925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-channel speech enhancement algorithms are often used in resource-constrained embedded devices, where low latency and low complexity designs gain more importance. In recent years, researchers have proposed a wide variety of novel solutions to this problem. In particular, a recent deep learning model named ULCNet is among the state-of-the-art approaches in this domain. This paper proposes an adaptation of ULCNet, by replacing its GRU layers with FastGRNNs, to reduce both computational latency and complexity. Furthermore, this paper shows empirical evidence on the performance decay of FastGRNNs in long audio signals during inference due to internal state drifting, and proposes a novel approach based on a trainable complementary filter to mitigate it. The resulting model, Fast-ULCNet, performs on par with the state-of-the-art original ULCNet architecture on a speech enhancement task, while reducing its model size by more than half and decreasing its latency by 34% on average.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient and Minimax-optimal In-context Nonparametric Regression with Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15014</link><description>arXiv:2601.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in-context learning for nonparametric regression with $\alpha$-H\"older smooth regression functions, for some $\alpha&gt;0$. We prove that, with $n$ in-context examples and $d$-dimensional regression covariates, a pretrained transformer with $\Theta(\log n)$ parameters and $\Omega\bigl(n^{2\alpha/(2\alpha+d)}\log^3 n\bigr)$ pretraining sequences can achieve the minimax-optimal rate of convergence $O\bigl(n^{-2\alpha/(2\alpha+d)}\bigr)$ in mean squared error. Our result requires substantially fewer transformer parameters and pretraining sequences than previous results in the literature. This is achieved by showing that transformers are able to approximate local polynomial estimators efficiently by implementing a kernel-weighted polynomial basis and then running gradient descent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One scale to rule them all: interpretable multi-scale Deep Learning for predicting cell survival after proton and carbon ion irradiation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15106</link><description>arXiv:2601.15106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the physical characteristics of the radiation field and biological damage is central to both radiotherapy and radioprotection, yet the link between spatial scales of energy deposition and biological effects remains not entirely understood. To address this, we developed an interpretable deep learning model that predicts cell survival after proton and carbon ion irradiation, leveraging sequential attention to highlight relevant features and provide insight into the contribution of different energy deposition scales. Trained and tested on the PIDE dataset, our model incorporates, beside LET, nanodosimetric and microdosimetric quantities simulated with MC-Startrack and Open-TOPAS, enabling multi-scale characterization. While achieving high predictive accuracy, our approach also emphasizes transparency in decision-making. We demonstrate high accuracy in predicting RBE for in vitro experiments. Multiple scales are utilized concurrently, with no single spatial scale being predominant. Quantities defined at smaller spatial domains generally have a greater influence, whereas the LET plays a lesser role.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15106v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Vision Models for Medical Imaging: A Hybrid Approach for PCOS Detection from Ultrasound Scans</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15119</link><description>arXiv:2601.15119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most familiar endocrine illness in women of reproductive age. Many Bangladeshi women suffer from PCOS disease in their older age. The aim of our research is to identify effective vision-based medical image analysis techniques and evaluate hybrid models for the accurate detection of PCOS. We introduced two novel hybrid models combining convolutional and transformer-based approaches. The training and testing data were organized into two categories: "infected" (PCOS-positive) and "noninfected" (healthy ovaries). In the initial stage, our first hybrid model, 'DenConST' (integrating DenseNet121, Swin Transformer, and ConvNeXt), achieved 85.69% accuracy. The final optimized model, 'DenConREST' (incorporating Swin Transformer, ConvNeXt, DenseNet121, ResNet18, and EfficientNetV2), demonstrated superior performance with 98.23% accuracy. Among all evaluated models, DenConREST showed the best performance. This research highlights an efficient solution for PCOS detection from ultrasound images, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy while reducing detection errors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15119v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Entropy of Soft Random Geometric Graphs in General Geometries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15194</link><description>arXiv:2601.15194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of the choice of embedding geometry on the entropy of random geometric graph ensembles with soft connection functions. First we show that when the connection range is small, the entropy is dependent only on the dimension of the geometry and not the shape, but for large connection ranges the boundaries of the domain matter. Next, we formulate the problem of estimating entropy as a problem of estimating the average degree of a graph with the binary entropy function as its connection function. We use this formulation to study the effect of boundaries on the entropy, and to estimate the entropy of soft random geometric graphs in complicated geometries where a closed form pair distance density is not available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15194v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-context principal component analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15239</link><description>arXiv:2601.15239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a tool to capture factors that explain variation in data. Across domains, data are now collected across multiple contexts (for example, individuals with different diseases, cells of different types, or words across texts). While the factors explaining variation in data are undoubtedly shared across subsets of contexts, no tools currently exist to systematically recover such factors. We develop multi-context principal component analysis (MCPCA), a theoretical and algorithmic framework that decomposes data into factors shared across subsets of contexts. Applied to gene expression, MCPCA reveals axes of variation shared across subsets of cancer types and an axis whose variability in tumor cells, but not mean, is associated with lung cancer progression. Applied to contextualized word embeddings from language models, MCPCA maps stages of a debate on human nature, revealing a discussion between science and fiction over decades. These axes are not found by combining data across contexts or by restricting to individual contexts. MCPCA is a principled generalization of PCA to address the challenge of understanding factors underlying data across contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15239v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Many Experiments, Few Repetitions, Unpaired Data, and Sparse Effects: Is Causal Inference Possible?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15254</link><description>arXiv:2601.15254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating causal effects under hidden confounding in the following unpaired data setting: we observe some covariates $X$ and an outcome $Y$ under different experimental conditions (environments) but do not observe them jointly; we either observe $X$ or $Y$. Under appropriate regularity conditions, the problem can be cast as an instrumental variable (IV) regression with the environment acting as a (possibly high-dimensional) instrument. When there are many environments but only a few observations per environment, standard two-sample IV estimators fail to be consistent. We propose a GMM-type estimator based on cross-fold sample splitting of the instrument-covariate sample and prove that it is consistent as the number of environments grows but the sample size per environment remains constant. We further extend the method to sparse causal effects via $\ell_1$-regularized estimation and post-selection refitting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15254v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Competition between service providers with strategic resource allocation: application to network slicing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04764</link><description>arXiv:1912.04764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a business model for 5G operators. Each operator is entitled to a share of a network operated by an Infrastructure Provider (InP) and use network slicing mechanisms to request network resources as needed for service provision. The network operators become Network Slice Tenants (NSTs). The InP performs the resource allocation based on a vector of weights chosen strategically by each NST. The weights distribute the NST's share of resources between its subscribers in each cell. We propose a strategy profile in which the NST chooses weights equal to the product of its share by the ratio between the total number of subscribers in the cell and the total number of subscribers in the network. We characterize the proposed solution in terms of subscription ratios and fractions of subscribers, for different cell capacities and user sensitivities. The proposed solution provides the exact values for the Nash equilibrium if the cells are homogeneous in terms of normalized capacity, which is a measure of the total amount of resources available in the cell. Otherwise, if the cells are heterogeneous, it provides an accurate approximation. We quantify the deviation from the equilibrium and conclude that it is highly accurate.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:1912.04764v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning from Discriminatory Training Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08189</link><description>arXiv:1912.08189v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised learning systems are trained using historical data and, if the data was tainted by discrimination, they may unintentionally learn to discriminate against protected groups. We propose that fair learning methods, despite training on potentially discriminatory datasets, shall perform well on fair test datasets. Such dataset shifts crystallize application scenarios for specific fair learning methods. For instance, the removal of direct discrimination can be represented as a particular dataset shift problem. For this scenario, we propose a learning method that provably minimizes model error on fair datasets, while blindly training on datasets poisoned with direct additive discrimination. The method is compatible with existing legal systems and provides a solution to the widely discussed issue of protected groups' intersectionality by striking a balance between the protected groups. Technically, the method applies probabilistic interventions, has causal and counterfactual formulations, and is computationally lightweight - it can be used with any supervised learning model to prevent direct and indirect discrimination via proxies while maximizing model accuracy for business necessity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:1912.08189v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Anytime Algorithms for Learning Fragments of Linear Temporal Logic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06726</link><description>arXiv:2110.06726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a specification language for finite sequences (called traces) widely used in program verification, motion planning in robotics, process mining, and many other areas. We consider the problem of learning LTL formulas for classifying traces; despite a growing interest of the research community, existing solutions suffer from two limitations: they do not scale beyond small formulas, and they may exhaust computational resources without returning any result. We introduce a new algorithm addressing both issues: our algorithm is able to construct formulas an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, and it is anytime, meaning that it in most cases successfully outputs a formula, albeit possibly not of minimal size. We evaluate the performances of our algorithm using an open source implementation against publicly available benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2110.06726v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A pressure-robust HHO method for the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on general meshes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07180</link><description>arXiv:2203.07180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work [10], we have introduced a pressure-robust Hybrid High-Order method for the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on matching simplicial meshes. Pressure-robust methods are characterized by error estimates for the velocity that are fully independent of the pressure. A crucial question was left open in that work, namely whether the proposed construction could be extended to general polytopal meshes. In this paper we provide a positive answer to this question. Specifically, we introduce a novel divergence-preserving velocity reconstruction that hinges on the solution inside each element of a mixed problem on a subtriangulation, then use it to design discretizations of the body force and convective terms that lead to pressure robustness. An in-depth theoretical study of the properties of this velocity reconstruction, and their reverberation on the scheme, is carried out for polynomial degrees $k \geq 0$ and meshes composed of general polytopes. The theoretical convergence estimates and the pressure robustness of the method are confirmed by an extensive panel of numerical examples.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2203.07180v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semantic Image Synthesis via Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00050</link><description>arXiv:2207.00050v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in various image generation tasks compared with Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs). Recent work on semantic image synthesis mainly follows the de facto GAN-based approaches, which may lead to unsatisfactory quality or diversity of generated images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on DDPM for semantic image synthesis. Unlike previous conditional diffusion model directly feeds the semantic layout and noisy image as input to a U-Net structure, which may not fully leverage the information in the input semantic mask, our framework processes semantic layout and noisy image differently. It feeds noisy image to the encoder of the U-Net structure while the semantic layout to the decoder by multi-layer spatially-adaptive normalization operators. To further improve the generation quality and semantic interpretability in semantic image synthesis, we introduce the classifier-free guidance sampling strategy, which acknowledge the scores of an unconditional model for sampling process. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity (FID) and diversity (LPIPS).

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics is a pervasive phenomenon observed in scientific and engineering disciplines. However, the task of deriving analytical expressions to describe nonlinear dynamics from limited data remains challenging. In this paper, we shall present a novel deep symbolic learning method called the "finite expression method" (FEX) to discover governing equations within a function space containing a finite set of analytic expressions, based on observed dynamic data. The key concept is to employ FEX to generate analytical expressions of the governing equations by learning the derivatives of partial differential equation (PDE) solutions through convolutions. Our numerical results demonstrate that our FEX surpasses other existing methods (such as PDE-Net, SINDy, GP, and SPL) in terms of numerical performance across a range of problems, including time-dependent PDE problems and nonlinear dynamical systems with time-varying coefficients. Moreover, the results highlight FEX's flexibility and expressive power in accurately approximating symbolic governing equations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2305.08342v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking the Influence of Pre-training on Explanation Performance in MR Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12150</link><description>arXiv:2306.12150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are frequently and successfully used in medical prediction tasks. They are often used in combination with transfer learning, leading to improved performance when training data for the task are scarce. The resulting models are highly complex and typically do not provide any insight into their predictive mechanisms, motivating the field of "explainable" artificial intelligence (XAI). However, previous studies have rarely quantitatively evaluated the "explanation performance" of XAI methods against ground-truth data, and transfer learning and its influence on objective measures of explanation performance has not been investigated. Here, we propose a benchmark dataset that allows for quantifying explanation performance in a realistic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification task. We employ this benchmark to understand the influence of transfer learning on the quality of explanations. Experimental results show that popular XAI methods applied to the same underlying model differ vastly in performance, even when considering only correctly classified examples. We further observe that explanation performance strongly depends on the task used for pre-training and the number of CNN layers pre-trained. These results hold after correcting for a substantial correlation between explanation and classification performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2306.12150v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Finite Expression Method for Solving High-Dimensional Committor Problems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12268</link><description>arXiv:2306.12268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition path theory (TPT) is a mathematical framework for quantifying rare transition events between a pair of selected metastable states $A$ and $B$. Central to TPT is the committor function, which describes the probability to hit the metastable state $B$ prior to $A$ from any given starting point of the phase space. Once the committor is computed, the transition channels and the transition rate can be readily found. The committor is the solution to the backward Kolmogorov equation with appropriate boundary conditions. However, solving it is a challenging task in high dimensions due to the need to mesh a whole region of the ambient space. In this work, we explore the finite expression method (FEX, Liang and Yang (2022)) as a tool for computing the committor. FEX approximates the committor by an algebraic expression involving a fixed finite number of nonlinear functions and binary arithmetic operations. The optimal nonlinear functions, the binary operations, and the numerical coefficients in the expression template are found via reinforcement learning. The FEX-based committor solver is tested on several high-dimensional benchmark problems. It gives comparable or better results than neural network-based solvers. Most importantly, FEX is capable of correctly identifying the algebraic structure of the solution which allows one to reduce the committor problem to a low-dimensional one and find the committor with any desired accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2306.12268v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards AI Transparency and Accountability: A Global Framework for Exchanging Information on AI Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13658</link><description>arXiv:2307.13658v3 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Barrier certificates provide functional overapproximations for the reachable set of dynamical systems and provide inductive guarantees on the safe evolution of the system. In automata-theoretic verification, a key query is to determine whether the system visits a given predicate over the states finitely often, typically resulting from the complement of the traditional Buchi acceptance condition. This paper proposes a barrier certificate approach to answer such queries by developing a notion of co-Buchi barrier certificates (CBBCs) that generalize classic barrier certificates to ensure that the traces of a system visit a given predicate a fixed number of times. Our notion of CBBC is inspired from bounded synthesis paradigm to LTL realizability, where the LTL specifications are converted to safety automata via universal co-Buchi automata with a bound on final state visitations provided as a hyperparameter. Our application of CBBCs in verification is analogous: we fix a bound and search for a suitable barrier certificate, increasing the bound if no suitable function can be found. We then use these CBBCs to verify our system against properties specified by co-Buchi automata and demonstrate their effectiveness via some case studies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2311.07695v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowledge Problems in Protocol Analysis: Extending the Notion of Subterm Convergent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17226</link><description>arXiv:2401.17226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new form of restricted term rewrite system, the graph-embedded term rewrite system. These systems, and thus the name, are inspired by the graph minor relation and are more flexible extensions of the well-known homeomorphic-embedded property of term rewrite systems. As a motivating application area, we consider the symbolic analysis of security protocols, and more precisely the two knowledge problems defined by the deduction problem and the static equivalence problem. In this field restricted term rewrite systems, such as subterm convergent ones, have proven useful since the knowledge problems are decidable for such systems. Many of the same decision procedures still work for examples of systems which are "beyond subterm convergent". However, the applicability of the corresponding decision procedures to these examples must often be proven on an individual basis. This is due to the problem that they don't fit into an existing syntactic definition for which the procedures are known to work. Here we show that many of these systems belong to a particular subclass of graph-embedded convergent systems, called contracting convergent systems. On the one hand, we show that the knowledge problems are decidable for the subclass of contracting convergent systems. On the other hand, we show that the knowledge problems are undecidable for the class of graph-embedded systems. Going further, we compare and contrast these graph embedded systems with several notions and properties already known in the protocol analysis literature. Finally, we provide several combination results, both for the combination of multiple contracting convergent systems, and then for the combination of contracting convergent systems with particular permutative equational theories.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2401.17226v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GSINA: Improving Subgraph Extraction for Graph Invariant Learning via Graph Sinkhorn Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07191</link><description>arXiv:2402.07191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph invariant learning (GIL) seeks invariant relations between graphs and labels under distribution shifts. Recent works try to extract an invariant subgraph to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, yet existing approaches either lack explicit control over compactness or rely on hard top-$k$ selection that shrinks the solution space and is only partially differentiable. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the drawbacks of some existing works and propose a few general principles for invariant subgraph extraction: 1) separability, as encouraged by our sparsity-driven mechanism, to filter out the irrelevant common features; 2) softness, for a broader solution space; and 3) differentiability, for a soundly end-to-end optimization pipeline. Specifically, building on optimal transport, we propose Graph Sinkhorn Attention (GSINA), a fully differentiable, cardinality-constrained attention mechanism that assigns sparse-yet-soft edge weights via Sinkhorn iterations and induces node attention. GSINA provides explicit controls for separability and softness, and uses a Gumbel reparameterization to stabilize training. It convergence behavior is also theoretically studied.

Abstract: Visual instruction tuning is a key training stage of large multimodal models. However, when learning multiple visual tasks simultaneously, this approach often results in suboptimal and imbalanced overall performance due to latent knowledge conflicts across tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Adaptive Task Balancing approach tailored for visual instruction tuning (VisATB). Specifically, we measure two critical dimensions for visual task balancing based on validation performance: (1) Inter-Task Contribution, the mechanism where learning one task enhances the performance on others owing to shared knowledge across tasks, and (2) Intra-Task Difficulty, which denotes the inherent learning difficulty of a single task. Furthermore, we propose prioritizing three categories of tasks with greater weight: those that offer substantial contributions to others, those that receive minimal contributions from others, and those that present high learning difficulties. Among these three task weighting strategies, the first and third focus on improving overall performance, and the second targets the mitigation of performance imbalance. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our VisATB approach consistently achieves superior and more balanced overall performance in visual instruction tuning.

Abstract: The evolution of video generation from text, from animating MNIST to simulating the world with Sora, has progressed at a breakneck speed. Here, we systematically discuss how far text-to-video generation technology supports essential requirements in world modeling. We curate 250+ studies on text-based video synthesis and world modeling. We then observe that recent models increasingly support spatial, action, and strategic intelligences in world modeling through adherence to completeness, consistency, invention, as well as human interaction and control. We conclude that text-to-video generation is adept at world modeling, although homework in several aspects, such as the diversity-consistency trade-offs, remains to be addressed.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2403.05131v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Functional Correctness: Exploring Hallucinations in LLM-Generated Code</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00971</link><description>arXiv:2404.00971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced various applications on software engineering tasks, particularly in code generation. Despite the promising performance, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, which means LLMs might produce outputs that deviate from users' intent, exhibit internal inconsistencies, or misaligned with the real-world knowledge, making the deployment of LLMs potentially risky in a wide range of applications. Existing work mainly focuses on investigating the hallucination in the domain of Natural Language Generation (NLG), leaving a gap in comprehensively understanding the types, causes, and impacts of hallucinations in the context of code generation. To bridge the gap, we conducted a thematic analysis of the LLM-generated code to summarize and categorize the hallucinations, as well as their causes and impacts. Our study established a comprehensive taxonomy of code hallucinations, encompassing 3 primary categories and 12 specific categories. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the distribution of hallucinations, exploring variations among different LLMs and benchmarks. Moreover, we perform an in-depth analysis on the causes and impacts of various hallucinations, aiming to provide valuable insights into hallucination mitigation. Finally, to enhance the correctness and reliability of LLM-generated code in a lightweight manner, we explore training-free hallucination mitigation approaches by prompt enhancing techniques. We believe our findings will shed light on future research about code hallucination evaluation and mitigation, ultimately paving the way for building more effective and reliable code LLMs in the future.

Abstract: Human cognition excels at transcending sensory input and forming latent representations that structure our understanding of the world. While Large Language Model (LLM) agents demonstrate emergent reasoning and decision-making abilities, they lack a principled framework for capturing latent structures and modeling uncertainty. In this work, we explore for the first time how to bridge LLM agents with probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to address agentic reasoning under uncertainty. To this end, we introduce Verbalized Probabilistic Graphical Modeling (vPGM), a Bayesian agentic framework that (i) guides LLM agents in following key principles of PGMs through natural language and (ii) refines the resulting posterior distributions via numerical Bayesian inference. Unlike many traditional probabilistic methods requiring substantial domain expertise, vPGM bypasses expert-driven model design, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited assumptions. We evaluated our model on several agentic reasoning tasks, both close-ended and open-ended. Our results indicate that the model effectively enhances confidence calibration and text generation quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.05516v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GECOBench: A Gender-Controlled Text Dataset and Benchmark for Quantifying Biases in Explanations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11547</link><description>arXiv:2406.11547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large pre-trained language models have become a crucial backbone for many downstream tasks in natural language processing (NLP), and while they are trained on a plethora of data containing a variety of biases, such as gender biases, it has been shown that they can also inherit such biases in their weights, potentially affecting their prediction behavior. However, it is unclear to what extent these biases also affect feature attributions generated by applying "explainable artificial intelligence" (XAI) techniques, possibly in unfavorable ways. To systematically study this question, we create a gender-controlled text dataset, GECO, in which the alteration of grammatical gender forms induces class-specific words and provides ground truth feature attributions for gender classification tasks. This enables an objective evaluation of the correctness of XAI methods. We apply this dataset to the pre-trained BERT model, which we fine-tune to different degrees, to quantitatively measure how pre-training induces undesirable bias in feature attributions and to what extent fine-tuning can mitigate such explanation bias. To this extent, we provide GECOBench, a rigorous quantitative evaluation framework for benchmarking popular XAI methods. We show a clear dependency between explanation performance and the number of fine-tuned layers, where XAI methods are observed to benefit particularly from fine-tuning or complete retraining of embedding layers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2406.11547v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Image class translation: visual inspection of class-specific hypotheticals and classification based on translation distance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08973</link><description>arXiv:2408.08973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: A major barrier to the implementation of artificial intelligence for medical applications is the lack of explainability and high confidence for incorrect decisions, specifically with out-of-domain samples. We propose a generalization of image translation networks for image classification and demonstrate their potential as a more interpretable alternative to conventional black-box classifiers. Approach: We train an image2image network to translate an input image to class-specific hypotheticals, and then compare these with the input, both visually and quantitatively. Translation distances, i.e., the degree of alteration needed to conform to one class or another, are examined for clusters and trends, and used as simple low-dimensional feature vectors for classification. Results: On melanoma/benign dermoscopy images, a translation distance classifier achieved 80% accuracy using only a 2-dimensional feature space (versus 85% for a conventional CNN using a ~62,000-dimensional feature space). Visual inspection of rendered images revealed dataset biases, such as scalebars, vignetting, and pale background pigmentation in melanomas. Image distributions in translation distance space revealed a natural separation along the lines of dermatologist decision to biopsy, rather than between malignant and benign. On bone marrow cytology images, translation distance classifiers outperformed a conventional CNN in both 3-class (92% accuracy vs 89% for CNN) and 6-class (90% vs 86% for CNN) scenarios. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept shows the potential for image2image networks to go beyond artistic/stylistic changes and to expose dataset biases, perform dimension reduction and dataset visualization, and in some cases, potentially outperform conventional end-to-end CNN classifiers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.08973v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Modeling and Statistical Characterization of Large-Scale Automotive Radar Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13645</link><description>arXiv:2408.13645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of discrete clutter and co-channel interference on the performance of automotive radar networks has been studied using stochastic geometry, in particular, by leveraging two-dimensional Poisson point processes (PPPs). However, such characterization does not take into account the impact of street geometry and the fact that the location of the automotive radars are restricted to the streets as their domain rather than the entire Euclidean plane. In addition, the structure of the streets may change drastically as a vehicle moves out of a city center towards the outskirts. Consequently, not only the radar performance change but also the radar parameters and protocols must be adapted for optimum performance. In this paper, we propose and characterize line and Cox process-based street and point models to analyze large-scale automotive radar networks. We consider the classical Poisson line process (PLP) and the newly introduced Binomial line process (BLP) model to emulate the streets and the corresponding PPP-based Cox process to emulate the vehicular nodes. In particular, the BLP model effectively considers the spatial variation of street geometry across different parts of the city. We derive the effective interference set experienced by an automotive radar, the statistics of distance to interferers, and characterize the detection probability of the ego radar as a function of street and vehicle density. Finally, leveraging the real-world data on urban streets and vehicle density across different cities of the world, we present how the radar performance varies in different parts of the city as well as across different times of the day. Thus, our study equips network operators and automotive manufacturers with essential system design insights to plan and optimize automotive radar networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.13645v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: Meta-Analysis of Watermarks, Transferable Attacks and Adversarial Defenses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08864</link><description>arXiv:2410.08864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formalize and analyze the trade-off between backdoor-based watermarks and adversarial defenses, framing it as an interactive protocol between a verifier and a prover. While previous works have primarily focused on this trade-off, our analysis extends it by identifying transferable attacks as a third, counterintuitive, but necessary option. Our main result shows that for all learning tasks, at least one of the three exists: a watermark, an adversarial defense, or a transferable attack. By transferable attack, we refer to an efficient algorithm that generates queries indistinguishable from the data distribution and capable of fooling all efficient defenders. Using cryptographic techniques, specifically fully homomorphic encryption, we construct a transferable attack and prove its necessity in this trade-off. Finally, we show that tasks of bounded VC-dimension allow adversarial defenses against all attackers, while a subclass allows watermarks secure against fast adversaries.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.08864v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Architectural Scaling Surpass Basis Complexity? Efficient KANs with Single-Parameter Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14951</link><description>arXiv:2410.14951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The landscape of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) is rapidly expanding, yet lacks a unified theoretical framework and a clear principle for efficient architecture design. This paper addresses these gaps with three core contributions. First, we introduce the Universal KAN (Uni-KAN) framework, a novel abstraction that formally unifies all KAN-style networks through dense and sparse representations. We prove their interchangeability and provide an open-source library for this framework, facilitating future research. Second, we propose the Efficient KAN Expansion (EKE) Hypothesis, a design philosophy positing that allocating parameters to architectural scaling rather than basis function complexity yields superior performance. Third, we present Single-Parameter KANs (SKANs), a family of ultra-lightweight networks that embody the EKE Hypothesis. Our comprehensive experiments provide the first strong empirical validation for the theoretical necessity of basis function smoothness for stable training. Furthermore, SKANs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving F1 scores by up to 6.51\% and reducing test loss by 93.1\%, while achieving up to 6x faster training speeds compared to existing KAN variants. These results establish a robust framework, a guiding hypothesis, and a practical methodology for designing the next generation of efficient and powerful neural networks.

Abstract: Ever since the Dennard scaling broke down in the early 2000s and the frequency of the CPUs stalled, vendors have started to increase the core count in each CPU chip at the expense of introducing heterogeneity, thus ushering the era of NUMA and Chiplet processors. Since then, the heterogeneity in the design space of hardware has only increased to the point that DBMS performance may vary significantly up to an order of magnitude in modern servers. An important factor that affects performance includes the location of the logical cores where the DBMS queries execute, and the location where the data resides. This paper introduces P-MOSS, a learned spatial scheduling framework that schedules query execution to specific logical cores, and co-locates data on the corresponding NUMA node. For cross-hardware and workload adaptability, P-MOSS leverages core principles from Large Language Models, such as Next Token prediction, Generative Pre-training, and Fine-tuning. In the spirit of hardware-software synergy, P-MOSS guides its scheduling decision solely based on the low-level hardware statistics collected from the hardware Performance Monitoring Unit with the aid of a Decision Transformer. Experimental evaluation is performed in the context of the B$^+$-Tree index. Performance results demonstrate that P-MOSS offers an improvement of up to $6\times$ over traditional schedules in terms of query throughput.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.02933v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NumGrad-Pull: Numerical Gradient Guided Tri-plane Representation for Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17392</link><description>arXiv:2411.17392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing continuous surfaces from unoriented and unordered 3D points is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recent advancements address this problem by training neural signed distance functions to pull 3D location queries to their closest points on a surface, following the predicted signed distances and the analytical gradients computed by the network. In this paper, we introduce NumGrad-Pull, leveraging the representation capability of tri-plane structures to accelerate the learning of signed distance functions and enhance the fidelity of local details in surface reconstruction. To further improve the training stability of grid-based tri-planes, we propose to exploit numerical gradients, replacing conventional analytical computations. Additionally, we present a progressive plane expansion strategy to facilitate faster signed distance function convergence and design a data sampling strategy to mitigate reconstruction artifacts. Our extensive experiments across a variety of benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Abstract: The alignment of pre-trained LLMs continues to draw significant attention from both industry and academia, aiming to ensure responses that are helpful, harmless, and honest. However, identifying a point in the model's representation subspace that simultaneously satisfies all these properties remains challenging. H3Fusion addresses this challenge by introducing a mixture-of-experts (MoE)-based fusion mechanism that models alignment as a controllable drift within the subspace, guided by a drift-regularization loss to balance competing alignment dimensions. Furthermore, we formulate the alignment by finding a dual objective of harnessing the distance of generated embeddings and alignment embeddings, and introduce a gating loss by canalizing the activations on the contributing experts. Extensive evaluations of three benchmark datasets show that H3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest in three aspects: it outperforms each individually aligned model by 11.37%, and provides stronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by 13.77% and model-merging approaches by 6.18%.

Abstract: The high costs and risks involved in extensive environment interactions hinder the practical application of current online safe reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While offline safe RL addresses this by learning policies from static datasets, the performance therein is usually limited due to reliance on data quality and challenges with out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Inspired by recent successes in offline-to-online (O2O) RL, it is crucial to explore whether offline safe RL can be leveraged to facilitate faster and safer online policy learning, a direction that has yet to be fully investigated. To fill this gap, we first demonstrate that naively applying existing O2O algorithms from standard RL would not work well in the safe RL setting due to two unique challenges: \emph{erroneous Q-estimations}, resulted from offline-online objective mismatch and offline cost sparsity, and \emph{Lagrangian mismatch}, resulted from difficulties in aligning Lagrange multipliers between offline and online policies. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Marvel}, a novel framework for O2O safe RL, comprising two key components that work in concert: \emph{Value Pre-Alignment} to align the Q-functions with the underlying truth before online learning, and \emph{Adaptive PID Control} to effectively adjust the Lagrange multipliers during online finetuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marvel significantly outperforms existing baselines in both reward maximization and safety constraint satisfaction. By introducing the first policy-finetuning based framework for O2O safe RL, which is compatible with many offline and online safe RL methods, our work has the great potential to advance the field towards more efficient and practical safe RL solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.04426v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PanoDreamer: Optimization-Based Single Image to 360 3D Scene With Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04827</link><description>arXiv:2412.04827v3 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: As more people meet, interact, and socialize online, Social Virtual Reality (VR) emerges as a technology that bridges the gap between traditional face-to-face and online communication. Unlike traditional screen-based applications, Social VR provides immersive, spatial, and three-dimensional social interactions, making it a potential tool for enhancing remote collaborations. Despite the growing interest in Social VR, research on its role in collaboration remains fragmented, calling for a synthesis to identify research gaps and future directions. We conducted a 20-year scoping review, screening 2,035 articles and identifying 62 articles that addressed how Social VR has supported collaboration. Our analysis shows three key levels of support: Social VR can enhance individual perceptions and experiences within their groups, foster team dynamics with virtual elements that enable realistic interactions, and employ the unique affordances of VR to augment users' spaces. We discuss how future research in Social VR should move beyond replicating physical-world interactions and explore how immersive environments can cultivate long-term collaboration, trust, and more diverse and inclusive participation. This review highlights the current practices and challenges, highlighting new opportunities for theorizing and designing Social VR systems that responsibly support remote collaborations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.20266v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CT-PatchTST: Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer for Long-Term Renewable Energy Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08620</link><description>arXiv:2501.08620v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is fundamental to enhancing the dynamic performance of modern power grids, especially under high renewable penetration. This paper presents Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer (CT-PatchTST), a novel deep learning model designed to provide long-term, high-fidelity forecasts of wind and solar power. Unlike conventional time-series models, CT-PatchTST captures both temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations-features that are critical for effective energy storage planning, control, and dispatch. Reliable forecasting enables proactive deployment of energy storage systems (ESSs), helping to mitigate uncertainties in renewable output, reduce system response time, and optimize storage operation based on location-specific flow and voltage conditions. Evaluated on real-world datasets from Denmark's offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar generation, CT-PatchTST outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness. By enabling predictive, data-driven coordination of ESSs across integrated source-grid-load-storage systems, this work contributes to the design of more stable, responsive, and cost-efficient power networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.08620v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Honeytrace: Plug&amp;Play Watermarking Framework against Model Extraction Attacks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09328</link><description>arXiv:2501.09328v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triggerable watermarking enables model owners to assert ownership against model extraction attacks.

We redefine the watermark transmission mechanism from an information perspective, designing a training-free multi-step transmission strategy that leverages the long-tailed effect of backdoor learning to achieve efficient and robust watermark embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neural Honeytrace reduces the average number of queries required for a worst-case t-test-based ownership verification to as low as $2\%$ of existing methods, while incurring zero training cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.09328v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Goal-Oriented Real-Time Bayesian Inference for Linear Autonomous Dynamical Systems With Application to Digital Twins for Tsunami Early Warning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14911</link><description>arXiv:2501.14911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a goal-oriented framework for constructing digital twins with the following properties: (1) they employ discretizations of high-fidelity PDE models governed by autonomous dynamical systems, leading to large-scale forward problems; (2) they solve a linear inverse problem to assimilate observational data to infer uncertain model components followed by a forward prediction of the evolving dynamics; and (3) the entire end-to-end, data-to-inference-to-prediction computation is carried out without approximation and in real time through a Bayesian framework that rigorously accounts for uncertainties. Several challenges must be overcome to realize this framework, including the large scale of the forward problem, the high dimensionality of the parameter space, and for a class of problems including those we target, the slow decay of the singular values of the parameter-to-observable map. Here we introduce a methodology to overcome these challenges by exploiting the autonomous structure of the forward model to decompose the solution of the inverse problem into an offline phase in which the PDE model is solved a limited number of times, and an online phase that computes the parameter inference and prediction of quantities of interest in real time, given observational data. Our goal is to apply this framework to construct digital twins for subduction zones to provide early warning for tsunamis. To this end, we show how our methodology can be used to employ seafloor pressure observations, along with the coupled acoustic-gravity wave equations, to infer the earthquake-induced seafloor motion (discretized with 10^9 parameters) and forecast the tsunami propagation. We present results of an end-to-end inference, prediction, and uncertainty quantification for a representative test problem with 10^8 inversion parameters for which goal-oriented Bayesian inference is accomplished in real time.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.14911v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Targeting Alignment: Extracting Safety Classifiers of Aligned LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16534</link><description>arXiv:2501.16534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alignment in large language models (LLMs) is used to enforce guidelines such as safety. Yet, alignment fails in the face of jailbreak attacks that modify inputs to induce unsafe outputs. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new technique for jailbreak attacks. We observe that alignment embeds a safety classifier in the LLM responsible for deciding between refusal and compliance, and seek to extract an approximation of this classifier: a surrogate classifier. To this end, we build candidate classifiers from subsets of the LLM. We first evaluate the degree to which candidate classifiers approximate the LLM's safety classifier in benign and adversarial settings. Then, we attack the candidates and measure how well the resulting adversarial inputs transfer to the LLM. Our evaluation shows that the best candidates achieve accurate agreement (an F1 score above 80%) using as little as 20% of the model architecture. Further, we find that attacks mounted on the surrogate classifiers can be transferred to the LLM with high success. For example, a surrogate using only 50% of the Llama 2 model achieved an attack success rate (ASR) of 70% with half the memory footprint and runtime -- a substantial improvement over attacking the LLM directly, where we only observed a 22% ASR. These results show that extracting surrogate classifiers is an effective and efficient means for modeling (and therein addressing) the vulnerability of aligned models to jailbreaking attacks.

Abstract: Autonomous systems are increasingly expected to operate in the presence of adversaries, though adversaries may infer sensitive information simply by observing a system. Therefore, present a deceptive sequential decision-making framework that not only conceals sensitive information, but actively misleads adversaries about it. We model autonomous systems as Markov decision processes, with adversaries using inverse reinforcement learning to recover reward functions. To counter them, we present three regularization strategies for policy synthesis problems that actively deceive an adversary about a system's reward. ``Diversionary deception'' leads an adversary to draw any false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Targeted deception'' leads an adversary to draw a specific false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Equivocal deception'' leads an adversary to infer that the real reward and a false reward both explain the system's behavior. We show how each form of deception can be implemented in policy optimization problems and analytically bound the loss in total accumulated reward induced by deception. Next, we evaluate these developments in a multi-agent setting. We show that diversionary, targeted, and equivocal deception all steer the adversary to false beliefs while still attaining a total accumulated reward that is at least 98% of its optimal, non-deceptive value.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.18803v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Shaping Sparse Rewards in Reinforcement Learning: A Semi-supervised Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19128</link><description>arXiv:2501.19128v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, reward signal for agents are exceedingly sparse, making it challenging to learn an effective reward function for reward shaping. To address this issue, the proposed approach in this paper performs reward shaping not only by utilizing non-zero-reward transitions but also by employing the \emph{Semi-Supervised Learning} (SSL) technique combined with a novel data augmentation to learn trajectory space representations from the majority of transitions, {i.e}., zero-reward transitions, thereby improving the efficacy of reward shaping. Experimental results in Atari and robotic manipulation demonstrate that our method outperforms supervised-based approaches in reward inference, leading to higher agent scores. Notably, in more sparse-reward environments, our method achieves up to twice the peak scores compared to supervised baselines. The proposed double entropy data augmentation enhances performance, showcasing a 15.8\% increase in best score over other augmentation methods</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.19128v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Survey of Quantized Graph Representation Learning: Connecting Graph Structures with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00681</link><description>arXiv:2502.00681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid advances in graph representation learning, with the continuous embedding approach emerging as the dominant paradigm. However, such methods encounter issues regarding parameter efficiency, interpretability, and robustness. Thus, Quantized Graph Representation (QGR) learning has recently gained increasing interest, which represents the graph structure with discrete codes instead of conventional continuous embeddings. Given its analogous representation form to natural language, QGR also possesses the capability to seamlessly integrate graph structures with large language models (LLMs). As this emerging paradigm is still in its infancy yet holds significant promise, we undertake this thorough survey to promote its rapid future prosperity. We first present the background of the general quantization methods and their merits. Moreover, we provide an in-depth demonstration of current QGR studies from the perspectives of quantized strategies, training objectives, distinctive designs, knowledge graph quantization, and applications. We further explore the strategies for code dependence learning and integration with LLMs. At last, we give discussions and conclude future directions, aiming to provide a comprehensive picture of QGR and inspire future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.00681v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AStar: Boosting Multimodal Reasoning with Automated Structured Thinking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02339</link><description>arXiv:2502.02339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models excel across diverse domains but struggle with complex visual reasoning tasks. To enhance their reasoning capabilities, current approaches typically rely on explicit search or post-training techniques. However, search-based methods suffer from computational inefficiency due to extensive solution space exploration, while post-training methods demand substantial data, computational resources, and often exhibit training instability. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AStar}, a training-free, \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{t}hinking paradigm for multimod\textbf{a}l \textbf{r}easoning. Specifically, we introduce novel ``thought cards'', a lightweight library of high-level reasoning patterns abstracted from prior samples. For each test problem, AStar adaptively retrieves the optimal thought cards and seamlessly integrates these external explicit guidelines with the model's internal implicit reasoning capabilities. Compared to previous methods, AStar eliminates computationally expensive explicit search and avoids additional complex post-training processes, enabling a more efficient reasoning approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves 53.9\% accuracy on MathVerse (surpassing GPT-4o's 50.2\%) and 32.7\% on MathVision (outperforming GPT-4o's 30.4\%). Further analysis reveals the remarkable transferability of our method: thought cards generated from mathematical reasoning can also be applied to other reasoning tasks, even benefiting general visual perception and understanding. AStar serves as a plug-and-play test-time inference method, compatible with other post-training techniques, providing an important complement to existing multimodal reasoning approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.02339v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exact Covariance Characterization for Controlled Linear Systems subject to Stochastic Parametric and Additive Uncertainties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03944</link><description>arXiv:2502.03944v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: In this work, we present a study combining two approaches in the context of solving PDEs: the continuous finite element method (FEM) and more recent techniques based on neural networks. In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become particularly interesting for rapidly solving PDEs, especially in high dimensions. However, their lack of accuracy can be a significant drawback in this context, hence the interest in combining them with FEM, for which error estimates are already known. The complete pipeline proposed here consists in modifying the classical FEM approximation spaces by taking information from a prior, chosen as the prediction of a neural network. On the one hand, this combination improves and certifies the prediction of neural networks, to obtain a fast and accurate solution. On the other hand, error estimates are proven, showing that such strategies outperform classical ones by a factor that depends only on the quality of the prior. We validate our approach with numerical results performed on parametric problems with 1D, 2D and 3D geometries. These experiments demonstrate that to achieve a given accuracy, a coarser mesh can be used with our enriched FEM compared to the standard FEM, leading to reduced computational time, particularly for parametric problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.04947v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Social Media Should Feel Like Minecraft, Not Instagram: Youth Visions for Meaningful Social Connections through Fictional Inquiry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06696</link><description>arXiv:2502.06696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted co-design workshops with 23 participants (ages 15--24) to explore how youth envision ideal remote social connection. Using Fictional Inquiry (FI) within a Harry Potter-inspired narrative, we found that youth perceive a disconnect between platforms labeled ``social media'' (like Instagram) and those where they actually experience meaningful connections (like Minecraft or Discord). Participants envisioned an immersive platform prioritizing meaningful social connection through presence and immersion, natural self-expression, intuitive spatial navigation leveraging physical-world norms, and playful, low-stakes opportunities for friendship development. We synthesize these visions into six themes articulating relational needs that current platforms systematically marginalize. The FI method proved effective in generating innovative ideas while empowering youth by fostering hope and agency over social media's future. Our findings challenge ``doom'' narratives by reframing social media's harms as outcomes of specific design choices, demonstrating how design research can reopen space for imagining more supportive forms of mediated connection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.06696v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Last-iterate Convergence for Symmetric, General-sum, $2 \times 2$ Games Under The Exponential Weights Dynamic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08063</link><description>arXiv:2502.08063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the discrete-time exponential-weights dynamic with a constant step size on all general-sum and symmetric $2 \times 2$ normal-form games, i.e. games with $2$ pure strategies per player, and where the ensuing payoff tuple is of the form $(A,A^\top)$ (where $A$ is the $2 \times 2$ payoff matrix corresponding to the first player). Such symmetric games commonly arise in real-world interactions between 'symmetric" agents who have identically defined utility functions -- such as Bertrand competition and multi-agent performative prediction, and display a rich multiplicity of equilibria despite the seemingly simple setting. Somewhat surprisingly, we show through a first-principles analysis that the exponential weights dynamic, which is popular in online learning, converges in the last iterate for such games regardless of initialization with an appropriately chosen step size. For certain games and/or initializations, we further show that the convergence rate is in fact exponential and holds for any step size.
  We illustrate our theory with extensive simulations and applications to the aforementioned game-theoretic interactions. In the case of multi-agent performative prediction, we formulate a new "mortgage competition" game between lenders (i.e. banks) who interact with a population of customers, and show that it fits into our framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.08063v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GAIA: A Global, Multi-modal, Multi-scale Vision-Language Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09598</link><description>arXiv:2502.09598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly trained on web-scraped, noisy image-text data, exhibiting limited exposure to the specialized domain of RS. This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis. GAIA comprises of 201,005 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions. Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena. The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks. We make our dataset, automated processing framework and fine-tuned model weights publicly available on our project's GitHub repository: https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/GAIA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.09598v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the unconventional Hug integrator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10199</link><description>arXiv:2502.10199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hug is a recently proposed iterative mapping used to design efficient updates in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Hug generates proposals that remain very close to hypersurfaces (level sets) of constant probabilty density. We analyse a generalization of Hug from hypersurfaces to manifolds of arbitrary dimensions, not necessarily arising in a sampling context. The analysis is based on interpreting, in a nonstandard way, Hug as a consistent discretization of a system of differential equations with a rather complicated structure. The proof of convergence of this discretization includes a number of unusual features we explore fully, in particular a supraconvergence property is established, whereby second order of convergence is attained with consistency of the first order. We uncover and discuss an unexpected property of the solutions of the underlying dynamical system that manifest itself by the existence of Hug trajectories that fail to cover the manifold of interest.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.10199v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Personality Editing for Language Models through Adjusting Self-Referential Queries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11789</link><description>arXiv:2502.11789v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are integral to applications such as conversational agents and content creation, where precise control over a model's personality is essential for maintaining tone, consistency, and user engagement. However, prevailing prompt-based or fine-tuning approaches either lack robustness or demand large-scale training data, making them costly and impractical. In this paper, we present PALETTE (Personality Adjustment by LLM SElf-TargeTed quEries), a novel method for personality editing in LLMs. Our approach introduces adjustment queries, where self-referential statements grounded in psychological constructs are treated analogously to factual knowledge, enabling direct editing of personality-related responses. Unlike fine-tuning, PALETTE requires only 12 editing samples to achieve substantial improvements in personality alignment across personality dimensions. Experimental results from both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our method enables more stable and well-balanced personality control in LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.11789v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Goggin's corrected Kalman Filter: Guarantees and Filtering Regimes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14053</link><description>arXiv:2502.14053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit a non-linear filter for {\em non-Gaussian} noises that was introduced in [1]. Goggin proved that transforming the observations by the score function and then applying the Kalman Filter (KF) to the transformed observations results in an asymptotically optimal filter. In the current paper, we study the convergence rate of Goggin's filter in a pre-limit setting that allows us to study a range of signal-to-noise regimes which includes, as a special case, Goggin's setting. Our guarantees are explicit in the level of observation noise, and unlike most other works in filtering, we do not assume Gaussianity of the noises.
  Our proofs build on combining simple tools from two separate literature streams. One is a general posterior Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for filtering. The other is convergence-rate bounds in the Fisher information central limit theorem.
  Along the way, we also study filtering regimes for linear state-space models, characterizing clearly degenerate regimes -- where trivial filters are nearly optimal -- and a {\em balanced} regime, which is where Goggin's filter has the most value. \footnote{This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Abstract: Opinion dynamics models how the publicly expressed opinions of users in a social network coevolve according to their neighbors as well as their own intrinsic opinion. Motivated by the real-world manipulation of social networks during the 2016 US elections and the 2019 Hong Kong protests, a growing body of work models the effects of a strategic actor who interferes with the network to induce disagreement or polarization. We lift the assumption of a single strategic actor by introducing a model in which any subset of network users can manipulate network outcomes. They do so by acting according to a fictitious intrinsic opinion. Strategic actors can have conflicting goals, and push competing narratives. We characterize the Nash Equilibrium of the resulting meta-game played by the strategic actors. Experiments on real-world social network datasets from Twitter, Reddit, and Political Blogs show that strategic agents can significantly increase polarization and disagreement, as well as increase the "cost" of the equilibrium. To this end, we give worst-case upper bounds on the Price of Misreporting (analogous to the Price of Anarchy). Finally, we give efficient learning algorithms for the platform to (i) detect whether strategic manipulation has occurred, and (ii) learn who the strategic actors are. Our algorithms are accurate on the same real-world datasets, suggesting how platforms can take steps to mitigate the effects of strategic behavior.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.15931v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Stackelberg Self-Annotation: A Robust Approach to Data-Efficient LLM Alignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18099</link><description>arXiv:2502.18099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences typically demands vast amounts of meticulously curated data, which is both expensive and prone to labeling noise. We propose Stackelberg Game Preference Optimization (SGPO), a robust alignment framework that models alignment as a two-player Stackelberg game between a policy (leader) and a worst-case preference distribution (follower). The proposed SGPO guarantees $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$-bounded regret within an $\epsilon$-Wasserstein ball, offering formal robustness to (self-)annotation noise. We instantiate SGPO with Stackelberg Self-Annotated Preference Optimization (SSAPO), which uses minimal human-labeled "seed" preferences and iteratively self-annotates new prompts. In each iteration, SSAPO applies a distributionally robust reweighting of synthetic annotations, ensuring that noisy or biased self-labels do not derail training. Remarkably, using only 2K seed preferences -- about 1/30 of standard human labels -- SSAPO achieves strong win rates against GPT-4 across multiple benchmarks within three iterations. These results highlight that a principled Stackelberg formulation yields data-efficient alignment for LLMs, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.18099v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18770</link><description>arXiv:2502.18770v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to \emph{reward hacking}, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. Although reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests two key design principles: (1) the RL reward should be bounded, and (2) the RL reward benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model as the signal for reinforcement learning. Moreover, PAR exhibits two critical variance-reduction properties that contribute to stabilizing the RLHF training process and effectively extending the tolerance window for early stopping. We evaluated PAR on the base model Gemma2-2B using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate of at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training.

Abstract: Open Semantic Mapping (OSM) is a key technology in robotic perception, combining semantic segmentation and SLAM techniques. This paper introduces a dynamically configurable and highly automated LLM/LVLM-powered pipeline for evaluating OSM solutions called OSMa-Bench (Open Semantic Mapping Benchmark). The study focuses on evaluating state-of-the-art semantic mapping algorithms under varying indoor lighting conditions, a critical challenge in indoor environments. We introduce a novel dataset with simulated RGB-D sequences and ground truth 3D reconstructions, facilitating the rigorous analysis of mapping performance across different lighting conditions. Through experiments on leading models such as ConceptGraphs, BBQ, and OpenScene, we evaluate the semantic fidelity of object recognition and segmentation. Additionally, we introduce a Scene Graph evaluation method to analyze the ability of models to interpret semantic structure.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RI3D, a novel 3DGS-based approach that harnesses the power of diffusion models to reconstruct high-quality novel views given a sparse set of input images. Our key contribution is separating the view synthesis process into two tasks of reconstructing visible regions and hallucinating missing regions, and introducing two personalized diffusion models, each tailored to one of these tasks. Specifically, one model ('repair') takes a rendered image as input and predicts the corresponding high-quality image, which in turn is used as a pseudo ground truth image to constrain the optimization. The other model ('inpainting') primarily focuses on hallucinating details in unobserved areas. To integrate these models effectively, we introduce a two-stage optimization strategy: the first stage reconstructs visible areas using the repair model, and the second stage reconstructs missing regions with the inpainting model while ensuring coherence through further optimization. Moreover, we augment the optimization with a novel Gaussian initialization method that obtains per-image depth by combining 3D-consistent and smooth depth with highly detailed relative depth. We demonstrate that by separating the process into two tasks and addressing them with the repair and inpainting models, we produce results with detailed textures in both visible and missing regions that outperform state-of-the-art approaches on a diverse set of scenes with extremely sparse inputs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.10860v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NetSSM: Multi-Flow and State-Aware Network Trace Generation using State Space Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22663</link><description>arXiv:2503.22663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Access to raw network traffic data is essential for many computer networking tasks, from traffic modeling to performance evaluation. Unfortunately, this data is scarce due to high collection costs and governance rules. Previous efforts explore this challenge by generating synthetic network data, but fail to reliably handle multi-flow sessions, struggle to reason about stateful communication in moderate to long-duration network sessions, and lack robust evaluations tied to real-world utility. We propose a new method based on state space models called NetSSM that generates raw network traffic at the packet-level granularity. Our approach captures interactions between multiple, interleaved flows -- an objective unexplored in prior work -- and effectively reasons about flow-state in sessions to capture traffic characteristics. NetSSM accomplishes this by learning from and producing traces 8x and 78x longer than existing transformer-based approaches. Evaluation results show that our method generates high-fidelity traces that outperform prior efforts in existing benchmarks. We also find that NetSSM's traces have high semantic similarity to real network data regarding compliance with standard protocol requirements and flow and session-level traffic characteristics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.22663v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph-based Approaches and Functionalities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10499</link><description>arXiv:2504.10499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with the factual error during inference due to the lack of sufficient training data and the most updated knowledge, leading to the hallucination problem. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained attention as a promising solution to address the limitation of LLMs, by retrieving relevant information from external source to generate more accurate answers to the questions. Given the pervasive presence of structured knowledge in the external source, considerable strides in RAG have been made to employ the techniques related to graphs and achieve more complex reasoning based on the topological information between knowledge entities. However, there is currently neither unified review examining the diverse roles of graphs in RAG, nor a comprehensive resource to help researchers navigate and contribute to this evolving field. This survey offers a novel perspective on the functionality of graphs within RAG and their impact on enhancing performance across a wide range of graph-structured data. It provides a detailed breakdown of the roles that graphs play in RAG, covering database construction, algorithms, pipelines, and tasks. Finally, it identifies current challenges and outline future research directions, aiming to inspire further developments in this field. Our graph-centered analysis highlights the commonalities and differences in existing methods, setting the stage for future researchers in areas such as graph learning, database systems, and natural language processing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.10499v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] OptimAI: Optimization from Natural Language Using LLM-Powered AI Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16918</link><description>arXiv:2504.16918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization plays a vital role in scientific research and practical applications. However, formulating a concrete optimization problem described in natural language into a mathematical form and selecting a suitable solver to solve the problem requires substantial domain expertise. We introduce OptimAI, a framework for solving Optimization problems described in natural language by leveraging LLM-powered AI agents, and achieve superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is built upon the following key roles: (1) a formulator that translates natural language problem descriptions into precise mathematical formulations; (2) a planner that constructs a high-level solution strategy prior to execution; and (3) a coder and a code critic capable of interacting with the environment and reflecting on outcomes to refine future actions. Ablation studies confirm that all roles are essential; removing the planner or code critic results in $5.8\times$ and $3.1\times$ drops in productivity, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce UCB-based debug scheduling to dynamically switch between alternative plans, yielding an additional $3.3\times$ productivity gain. Our design emphasizes multi-agent collaboration, and our experiments confirm that combining diverse models leads to performance gains. Our approach attains 88.1% accuracy on the NLP4LP dataset and 82.3% on the Optibench dataset, reducing error rates by 58% and 52%, respectively, over prior best results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.16918v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GenPTW: Latent Image Watermarking for Provenance Tracing and Tamper Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19567</link><description>arXiv:2504.19567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of generative image models has revolutionized AIGC creation while amplifying concerns over content provenance and manipulation forensics. Existing methods are typically either unable to localize tampering or restricted to specific generative settings, limiting their practical utility. We propose \textbf{GenPTW}, a \textbf{Gen}eral watermarking framework that unifies \textbf{P}rovenance tracing and \textbf{T}amper localization in latent space. It supports both in-generation and post-generation embedding without altering the generative process, and is plug-and-play compatible with latent diffusion models (LDMs) and visual autoregressive (VAR) models. To achieve precise provenance tracing and tamper localization, we embed the watermark using two complementary mechanisms: cross-attention fusion aligned with latent semantics and spatial fusion providing explicit spatial guidance for edit sensitivity. A tamper-aware extractor jointly conducts provenance tracing and tamper localization by leveraging watermark features together with high-frequency features. Experiments show that GenPTW maintains high visual fidelity and strong robustness against diverse AIGC-editing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.19567v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DAPPER: Discriminability-Aware Policy-to-Policy Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning for Query-Efficient Robot Skill Acquisition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06357</link><description>arXiv:2505.06357v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) enables policy learning through simple queries comparing trajectories from a single policy. While human responses to these queries make it possible to learn policies aligned with human preferences, PbRL suffers from low query efficiency, as policy bias limits trajectory diversity and reduces the number of discriminable queries available for learning preferences. This paper identifies preference discriminability, which quantifies how easily a human can judge which trajectory is closer to their ideal behavior, as a key metric for improving query efficiency. To address this, we move beyond comparisons within a single policy and instead generate queries by comparing trajectories from multiple policies, as training them from scratch promotes diversity without policy bias. We propose Discriminability-Aware Policy-to-Policy Preference-Based Efficient Reinforcement Learning (DAPPER), which integrates preference discriminability with trajectory diversification achieved by multiple policies. DAPPER trains new policies from scratch after each reward update and employs a discriminator that learns to estimate preference discriminability, enabling the prioritized sampling of more discriminable queries. During training, it jointly maximizes the preference reward and preference discriminability score, encouraging the discovery of highly rewarding and easily distinguishable policies. Experiments in simulated and real-world legged robot environments demonstrate that DAPPER outperforms previous methods in query efficiency, particularly under challenging preference discriminability conditions.

Abstract: The realization of autonomous scientific experimentation is currently limited by LLMs' struggle to grasp the strict procedural logic and accuracy required by biological protocols. To address this fundamental challenge, we present \textbf{BioProBench}, a comprehensive resource for procedural reasoning in biology. BioProBench is grounded in \textbf{BioProCorpus}, a foundational collection of 27,000 human-written protocols. From this corpus, we systematically constructed a dataset of over 550,000 task instances, offering both a large-scale training resource and a rigorous benchmark with novel metrics. Evaluating 10 mainstream LLMs, we find that while general comprehension is high, performance drops significantly on tasks demanding deep reasoning, quantitative precision, and safety awareness. To demonstrate the value of BioProCorpus in mitigating these issues, we developed \textbf{ProAgent}, grounded in our corpus, ProAgent substantially advances the state-of-the-art. BioProBench provides a rigorous diagnostic benchmark and a foundational resource for developing the next generation of reliable scientific AI.

Abstract: This paper highlights first steps towards enabling graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration of the task-parallel smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) solver SWIFT. Novel combinations of algorithms are presented, enabling SWIFT to function as a truly heterogeneous software leveraging task-parallelism on CPUs for memory-bound computations concurrently with GPUs for compute-bound computations while minimising the effects of CPU-GPU communication latency. The proposed algorithms are validated in extensive testing. The GPU acceleration methodology is shown to deliver up to 3.5 and 7.5 speedups for the offloaded computations when including and excluding the time required to prepare and post-process data transfers on the CPU side, respectively. The overall performance of the GPU-accelerated hydrodynamic solver for a full simulation on a single Grace-Hopper superchip is 1.8 times faster compared to the superchips fully parallelised CPU capabilities. This constitutes an improvement from 8 million particle updates/s for the full CPU-only baseline (115,000 updates per CPU core) to 15 million updates/s for the GPU-accelerated SPH solver. Moreover, it displays near-perfect strong scaling on 4 Grace-Hopper nodes. The GPU-acceleration is also demonstrated to give a 29 percent improvement in energy efficiency in comparison to CPU-only baselines. Finally, inter-influential bottlenecks in the prototype solver presented in this work are identified: A significant amount of time (up to 80 percent) of a GPU-offloading cycle is spent on preparing and post-processing particle data on the CPU for the transfer to and from the GPU, respectively. Approaches are suggested to minimise their effects and maximise the solver's performance in our future work.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.14538v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ThinkRec: Thinking-based recommendation via LLM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15091</link><description>arXiv:2505.15091v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled more semantic-aware recommendations through natural language generation. Existing LLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like manner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click history, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often leads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we propose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1 to System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking activation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and injects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable reasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying user preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this, we propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning difficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users' latent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users, thereby enhancing precision and personalization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ThinkRec significantly improves the accuracy and interpretability of recommendations. Our implementations are available at https://github.com/Yu-Qi-hang/ThinkRec.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.15091v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simulation-Guided Approximate Logic Synthesis Under the Maximum Error Constraint</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16769</link><description>arXiv:2505.16769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate computing is an effective computing paradigm for improving the energy efficiency of error-tolerant applications. Approximate logic synthesis (ALS) is an automatic process to generate approximate circuits with reduced area, delay, and power, while satisfying user-specified error constraints. This paper focuses on ALS under the maximum error constraint. As an essential error metric that provides a worst-case error guarantee, the maximum error is crucial for many applications such as image processing and machine learning. This work proposes an efficient simulation-guided ALS flow that handles this constraint. It utilizes logic simulation to 1) prune local approximate changes (LACs) with large errors that violate the error constraint, and 2) accelerate the SAT-based LAC selection process. Furthermore, to enhance scalability, our ALS flow iteratively selects a set of promising LACs satisfying the error constraint to improve efficiency. The experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art method, our ALS flow accelerates by 30.6x, and further reduces the circuit area and delay by 18.2% and 4.9%, respectively. Notably, our flow scales to large EPFL benchmarks with up to 38540 nodes, which remain challenging for existing ALS methods tackling maximum error constraint.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.16769v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SPECTRE: Conditional System Prompt Poisoning to Hijack LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16888</link><description>arXiv:2505.16888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed via third-party system prompts downloaded from public marketplaces. We identify a critical supply-chain vulnerability: conditional system prompt poisoning, where an adversary injects a ``sleeper agent'' into a benign-looking prompt. Unlike traditional jailbreaks that aim for broad refusal-breaking, our proposed framework, SPECTRE, optimizes system prompts to trigger LLMs to output targeted, compromised responses only for specific queries (e.g., ``Who should I vote for the US President?'') while maintaining high utility on benign inputs. Operating in a strict black-box setting without model weight access, SPECTRE utilizes a two-stage optimization including a global semantic search followed by a greedy lexical refinement. Tested on open-source models and commercial APIs (GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5), SPECTRE achieves up to 70% F1 reduction on targeted queries with minimal degradation to general capabilities. We further demonstrate that these poisoned prompts evade standard defenses, including perplexity filters and typo-correction, by exploiting the natural noise found in real-world system prompts.

Abstract: Recalibration of binary probabilistic classifiers to a target prior probability is an important task in areas like credit risk management. However, recalibration of a classifier learned on a training dataset to a target on a test dataset in general is not a well-defined problem because there might be more than one way to transform the original posterior probabilities such that the target is matched. In this paper, methods for recalibration are analysed from a distribution shift perspective. Distribution shift assumptions linked to the area under the curve (AUC) of a probabilistic classifier are found to be useful for the design of meaningful recalibration methods. Two new methods called parametric covariate shift with posterior drift (CSPD) and ROC-based quasi moment matching (QMM) are proposed and tested together with some other methods in an example setting. The outcomes of the test suggest that the QMM methods discussed in the paper can provide appropriately conservative results in evaluations with concave functions like for instance risk weights functions for credit risk.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.19068v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Manalyzer: End-to-end Automated Meta-analysis with Multi-agent System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20310</link><description>arXiv:2505.20310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-analysis is a systematic research methodology that synthesizes data from multiple existing studies to derive comprehensive conclusions. This approach not only mitigates limitations inherent in individual studies but also facilitates novel discoveries through integrated data analysis. Traditional meta-analysis involves a complex multi-stage pipeline including literature retrieval, paper screening, and data extraction, which demands substantial human effort and time. However, while LLM-based methods can accelerate certain stages, they still face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in paper screening and data extraction. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system, Manalyzer, which achieves end-to-end automated meta-analysis through tool calls. The hybrid review, hierarchical extraction, self-proving, and feedback checking strategies implemented in Manalyzer significantly alleviate these two hallucinations. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of meta-analysis, we construct a new benchmark comprising 729 papers across 3 domains, encompassing text, image, and table modalities, with over 10,000 data points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Manalyzer achieves significant performance improvements over the LLM baseline in multi meta-analysis tasks.

Abstract: Many motion planning algorithms for automated driving require estimating the probability of collision (POC) to account for uncertainties in the measurement and estimation of the motion of road users. Common POC estimation techniques often utilize sampling-based methods that suffer from computational inefficiency and a non-deterministic estimation, i.e., each estimation result for the same inputs is slightly different. In contrast, optimization-based motion planning algorithms require computationally efficient POC estimation, ideally using deterministic estimation, such that typical optimization algorithms for motion planning retain feasibility. Estimating the POC analytically, however, is challenging because it depends on understanding the collision conditions (e.g., vehicle's shape) and characterizing the uncertainty in motion prediction. In this paper, we propose an approach in which we estimate the POC between two vehicles by over-approximating their shapes by a multi-circular shape approximation. The position and heading of the predicted vehicle are modelled as random variables, contrasting with the literature, where the heading angle is often neglected. We guarantee that the provided POC is an over-approximation, which is essential in providing safety guarantees. For the particular case of Gaussian uncertainty in the position and heading, we present a computationally efficient algorithm for computing the POC estimate. This algorithm is then used in a path-following stochastic model predictive controller (SMPC) for motion planning. With the proposed algorithm, the SMPC generates reproducible trajectories while the controller retains its feasibility in the presented test cases and demonstrates the ability to handle varying levels of uncertainty.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.21161v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Reliability and Stability of Selective Methods in Malware Classification Tasks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22843</link><description>arXiv:2505.22843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance figures of modern drift-adaptive malware classifiers appear promising, but does this translate to genuine operational reliability? The standard evaluation paradigm primarily focuses on baseline performance metrics, neglecting confidence-error alignment and operational stability. While prior works established the importance of temporal evaluation and introduced selective classification in malware classification tasks, we take a complementary direction by investigating whether malware classifiers maintain reliable and stable confidence estimates under distribution shifts and exploring the tensions between scientific advancement and practical impacts when they do not. We propose Aurora, a framework to evaluate malware classifiers based on their confidence quality and operational resilience. Aurora subjects the confidence profile of a given model to verification to assess the reliability of its estimates. Unreliable confidence estimates erode operational trust, waste valuable annotation budgets on non-informative samples for active learning, and leave error-prone instances undetected in selective classification. Aurora is further complemented by a set of metrics designed to go beyond point-in-time performance, striving towards a more holistic assessment of operational stability throughout temporal evaluation periods. The fragility we observe in SOTA frameworks across datasets of varying drift severity suggests it may be time to revisit the underlying assumptions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.22843v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] StrucSum: Graph-Structured Reasoning for Long Document Extractive Summarization with LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22950</link><description>arXiv:2505.22950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot summarization, but often struggle to model document structure and identify salient information in long texts. In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and vanilla prompting. In particular, on ArXiv, it increases FactCC and SummaC by 19.2\% and 8.0\% points, demonstrating stronger alignment between summaries and source content. The ablation study shows that the combination of multiple strategies does not yield clear performance gains; therefore, structure-aware prompting with graph-based information represents a promising and underexplored direction for the advancement of zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs. Our source code is publicly available.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.22950v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Composite Flow Matching for Reinforcement Learning with Shifted-Dynamics Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23062</link><description>arXiv:2505.23062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporating pre-collected offline data can substantially improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but its benefits can break down when the transition dynamics in the offline dataset differ from those encountered online. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue by penalizing or filtering offline transitions in regions with large dynamics gap. However, their dynamics-gap estimators often rely on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when offline and online dynamics have mismatched support. To address this challenge, we propose CompFlow, a principled framework built on the theoretical connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model the online dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of a pretrained offline flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior. This composite structure provides two advantages: (1) improved generalization when learning online dynamics under limited interaction data, and (2) a well-defined and stable estimate of the dynamics gap via the Wasserstein distance between offline and online transitions. Building on this dynamics-gap estimator, we further develop an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in high-gap regions, and show theoretically that it reduces the performance gap to the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow consistently outperforms strong baselines across a range of RL benchmarks with shifted-dynamics data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.23062v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decentralized COVID-19 Health System Leveraging Blockchain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02674</link><description>arXiv:2506.02674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of the Internet, the amount of data generated by the medical industry each year has grown exponentially. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) manages the electronic data generated during the user's treatment process. Typically, an EHR data manager belongs to a medical institution. This traditional centralized data management model has many unreasonable or inconvenient aspects, such as difficulties in data sharing, and it is hard to verify the authenticity and integrity of the data. The decentralized, non-forgeable, data unalterable and traceable features of blockchain are in line with the application requirements of EHR. This paper takes the most common COVID-19 as the application scenario and designs a COVID-19 health system based on blockchain, which has extensive research and application value. Considering that the public and transparent nature of blockchain violates the privacy requirements of some health data, in the system design stage, from the perspective of practical application, the data is divided into public data and private data according to its characteristics. For private data, data encryption methods are adopted to ensure data privacy. The searchable encryption technology is combined with blockchain technology to achieve the retrieval function of encrypted data. Then, the proxy re-encryption technology is used to realize authorized access to data. In the system implementation part, based on the Hyperledger Fabric architecture, some functions of the system design are realized, including data upload, retrieval of the latest data and historical data. According to the environment provided by the development architecture, Go language chaincode (smart contract) is written to implement the relevant system functions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.02674v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Identifying Reliable Evaluation Metrics for Scientific Text Revision</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04772</link><description>arXiv:2506.04772v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains. Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers the most reliable assessment of revision quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04772v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] E-BATS: Efficient Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Speech Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07078</link><description>arXiv:2506.07078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech Foundation Models encounter significant performance degradation when deployed in real-world scenarios involving acoustic domain shifts, such as background noise and speaker accents. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i) lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii) a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.07078v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PankRAG: Enhancing Graph Retrieval via Globally Aware Query Resolution and Dependency-Aware Reranking Mechanism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11106</link><description>arXiv:2506.11106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent graph-based RAG approaches leverage knowledge graphs by extracting entities from a query to fetch their associated relationships and metadata. However, relying solely on entity extraction often results in the misinterpretation or omission of latent critical information and relationships. This can lead to the retrieval of irrelevant or contradictory content, as well as the exclusion of essential information, thereby increasing hallucination risks and undermining the quality of generated responses. In this paper, we propose PankRAG, a framework designed to capture and resolve the latent relationships within complex queries that prior methods overlook. It achieves this through a synergistic combination of a globally-aware hierarchical resolution pathway and a dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first generates a globally aware resolution pathway that captures parallel and progress relationships, guiding LLMs to resolve queries through a hierarchical reasoning path. Additionally, its dependency-aware reranking mechanism utilizes resolved sub-question dependencies to augment and validate the retrieved content of the current unresolved sub-question. Experimental results demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its generalizability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.11106v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Multi-Stage Augmented Multimodal Interaction Network for Quantifying Fish Feeding Intensity Using Feeding Image, Audio and Water Wave</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14170</link><description>arXiv:2506.14170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recirculating aquaculture systems, accurate and effective assessment of fish feeding intensity is crucial for reducing feed costs and calculating optimal feeding times. However, current studies have limitations in modality selection, feature extraction and fusion, and co-inference for decision making, which restrict further improvement in the accuracy, applicability and reliability of multimodal fusion models. To address this problem, this study proposes a Multi-stage Augmented Multimodal Interaction Network (MAINet) for quantifying fish feeding intensity. Firstly, a general feature extraction framework is proposed to efficiently extract feature information from input image, audio and water wave datas. Second, an Auxiliary-modality Reinforcement Primary-modality Mechanism (ARPM) is designed for inter-modal interaction and generate enhanced features, which consists of a Channel Attention Fusion Network (CAFN) and a Dual-mode Attention Fusion Network (DAFN). Finally, an Evidence Reasoning (ER) rule is introduced to fuse the output results of each modality and make decisions, thereby completing the quantification of fish feeding intensity. The experimental results show that the constructed MAINet reaches 96.76%, 96.78%, 96.79% and 96.79% in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score respectively, and its performance is significantly higher than the comparison models. Compared with models that adopt single-modality, dual-modality fusion and different decision-making fusion methods, it also has obvious advantages. Meanwhile, the ablation experiments further verified the key role of the proposed improvement strategy in improving the robustness and feature utilization efficiency of model, which can effectively improve the accuracy of the quantitative results of fish feeding intensity.

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that poses ongoing challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in tasks requiring deep semantic understanding. Current benchmarks often treat negation as a minor detail within broader tasks, such as natural language inference. Consequently, there is a lack of benchmarks specifically designed to evaluate comprehension of negation. In this work, we introduce Thunder-NUBench, a novel benchmark explicitly created to assess sentence-level understanding of negation in LLMs. Thunder-NUBench goes beyond merely identifying surface-level cues by contrasting standard negation with structurally diverse alternatives, such as local negation, contradiction, and paraphrase. This benchmark includes manually curated sentence-negation pairs and a multiple-choice dataset, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of models' understanding of negation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.14397v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fair Algorithms with Probing for Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14988</link><description>arXiv:2506.14988v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.14988v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Comparative Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Speech Enhancement in Real-World Noisy Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15000</link><description>arXiv:2506.15000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications, especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation, leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation. This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and +364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality, attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech. Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and +27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics, forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in challenging acoustic conditions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.15000v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LZBE: an LZ-style compressor supporting $O(\log n)$-time random access</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20107</link><description>arXiv:2506.20107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An LZ-like factorization of a string divides it into factors, each being either a single character or a copy of a preceding substring. While grammar-based compression schemes support efficient random access with space linear in the compressed size, no comparable guarantees are known for general LZ-like factorizations. This limitation motivated restricted variants such as LZ-End [Kreft and Navarro, 2013] and height-bounded LZ (LZHB) [Bannai et al., 2024], which trade off some compression efficiency for faster access. In this paper, we introduce LZ-Begin-End (LZBE), a new LZ-like variant in which every copy factor must refer to a contiguous sequence of preceding factors. This structural restriction ensures that any context-free grammar can be transformed into an LZBE factorization of the same size. We further study the greedy LZBE factorization, which selects each copy factor to be as long as possible while processing the input from left to right, and show that it can be computed in linear time. Moreover, we exhibit a family of strings for which the greedy LZBE factorization is asymptotically smaller than the smallest grammar. These results demonstrate that the LZBE scheme is strictly more expressive than grammar-based compression in the worst case. To support fast queries, we propose a data structure for LZBE-compressed strings that permits O(log n)-time random access within space linear in the compressed size, where n is the length of the input string.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.20107v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Complexity-aware fine-tuning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21220</link><description>arXiv:2506.21220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across three small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.58$ vs $0.45$ average accuracy) and outperforms the distillation approach ($0.58$ vs $0.56$ average accuracy) while using $81\%$ less data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.21220v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A new family of a posteriori error estimates for non-conforming finite element methods leading to stabilization-free error bounds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23381</link><description>arXiv:2506.23381v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: With new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies have shown that these models match or outperform the state-of-the-art in single-channel speech enhancement and audio representation learning. However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VB-DemandEx, a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, MambAttention significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art discriminative LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 without reverberation and EARS-WHAM_v2. MambAttention also matches or outperforms generative diffusion models in generalization performance while being competitive with language model baselines. Ablation studies highlight the importance of weight sharing between time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. Yet, MambAttention remains superior for cross-corpus generalization across all reported evaluation metrics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.00966v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ready Jurist One: Benchmarking Language Agents for Legal Intelligence in Dynamic Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04037</link><description>arXiv:2507.04037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework, designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o, falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights to guide future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.04037v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Naturally Mitigates Forgetting in Continual Post-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05386</link><description>arXiv:2507.05386v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.05386v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Geo-Registration of Terrestrial LiDAR Point Clouds with Satellite Images without GNSS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05999</link><description>arXiv:2507.05999v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds remains a significant challenge in urban environments where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are denied or degraded. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data, which require pre-calibration and assume stable signals. However, this assumption often fails in dense cities, resulting in localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured post-hoc geo-registration method that accurately aligns LiDAR point clouds with satellite images. The proposed approach targets point cloud datasets where reliable GNSS information is unavailable or degraded, enabling city-scale geo-registration as a post-processing solution. Our method uses a pre-trained Point Transformer to segment road points, then extracts road skeletons and intersections from the point cloud and the satellite image. Global alignment is achieved through rigid transformation using corresponding intersection points, followed by local non-rigid refinement with radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation discrepancies are corrected using terrain data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). To evaluate geo-registration accuracy, we measure the absolute distances between the roads extracted from the two modalities. Our method is validated on the KITTI benchmark and a newly collected dataset of Perth, Western Australia. On KITTI, our method achieves a mean planimetric alignment error of 0.69m, corresponding to a 50% reduction in global geo-registration bias compared to the raw KITTI annotations. On Perth dataset, it achieves a mean planimetric error of 2.17m from GNSS values extracted from Google Maps, corresponding to 57.4% improvement over rigid alignment. Elevation correlation factor improved by 30.5% (KITTI) and 55.8% (Perth).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.05999v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PDE-aware Optimizer for Physics-informed Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08118</link><description>arXiv:2507.08118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators remains an important direction for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.08118v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Two-Level Distributed Interference Management for Large-Scale HAPS-Empowered vHetNets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08299</link><description>arXiv:2507.08299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High altitude platform stations (HAPS) offer a promising solution for achieving ubiquitous connectivity in next-generation wireless networks (xG). Integrating HAPS with terrestrial networks, creating HAPS-empowered vertical heterogeneous networks (vHetNets), significantly improves coverage and capacity and supports emerging novel use cases. In HAPS-empowered vHetNets, HAPS and terrestrial network tiers can share the same spectrum, forming harmonized spectrum vHetNets that enhance spectral efficiency (SE). However, harmonized spectrum vHetNets face major challenges, including severe co-channel interference and scalability in large-scale deployments. To address the first challenge, we adopt a cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network architecture in which users are simultaneously served by multiple base stations using beamforming. However, beamforming weight design leads to a nonconvex, high-dimensional optimization problem, highlighting the scalability challenge. To address this second challenge, we develop a two-level distributed proportional fairness beamforming weight design (PFBWD) algorithm. This algorithm combines the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) with a three-block ADMM framework. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvements achieved by integrating HAPS with standalone terrestrial networks, as well as the reduced complexity and signaling overhead of the distributed algorithm compared to centralized algorithms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.08299v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Models Encode Semantics and Alignment in Linearly Separable Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09709</link><description>arXiv:2507.09709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. Yet it remains unclear to what extent LLMs linearly organize representations related to semantic understanding. To explore this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of hidden representations in 11 autoregressive models across six scientific topics. We find that high-level semantic information consistently resides in low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers and under prompts that elicit structured reasoning or alignment behavior$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content remains unchanged. These findings motivate geometry-aware tools that operate directly in latent space to detect and mitigate harmful and adversarial content. As a proof of concept, we train an MLP probe on final-layer hidden states as a lightweight latent-space guardrail. This approach substantially improves refusal rates on malicious queries and prompt injections that bypass both the model's built-in safety alignment and external token-level filters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.09709v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hyperphantasia: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Mental Visualization Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11932</link><description>arXiv:2507.11932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each puzzle is procedurally generated and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns, robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.11932v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Point Cloud Streaming with Latency-Driven Implicit Adaptation using MoQ</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15673</link><description>arXiv:2507.15673v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: In this article we propose new discretization-informed expressions for the residual stress tensor (RST) in a finite-volume based large-eddy simulation (LES-FVM). In addition to the classical RST $\overline{u u} - \bar{u} \bar{u}$ resulting from the non-commutation between filtering and the nonlinear stress, our RST also contains contributions from the numerical flux, discrete divergence, and pressure terms. Unlike the classical RST, our proposed RST is non-symmetric and non-local. The proposed form of the RST is important for generating appropriate reference data for LES closure modeling.
  Based on DNS results of the 1D Burgers and 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we show that the discretization-induced parts of the RST play an important role in the LES-FVM equation for common LES filter widths. When the discrete contribution is included, our RST expression gives zero a-posteriori error in LES, while existing RST expressions give errors that increase over time. For a Smagorinsky model, we show that the Smagorinsky coefficient is higher when fitted to our new RST than when fitted to the classical RST and gives improved results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.17051v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LRR-Bench: Left, Right or Rotate?

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding, which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on multiple tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents an integration study for a power electronic-based fast-frequency response technology, an asynchronous grid connection operating as an aggregator for behindthe-meter resources and distributed generators. Both technical feasibility and techno-economic viability studies are presented. The dynamic performance of the fast-frequency response enabled by the asynchronous grid connection is validated with Power Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments and transferred to an IEEE 9-bus system in DigSilent PowerFactory for dynamic stability analysis. We demonstrate that droop-based control enhancements to the local distributed generators could allow their aggregation to provide grid-supporting functionalities and participate in the market for ancillary services. To this end, we performed a long-term simulation embedding the system within the ancillary service market framework of PJM. The fast-frequency response regulation is subsequently used to calculate the potential revenue and project the results on a 15-year investment horizon. Finally, the techno-economic analysis concludes with recommendations for enhancements to access the full potential of distributed generators on a technical and regulatory level.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.23571v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] U-PINet: Physics-Informed Hierarchical Learning for Radar Cross Section Prediction via 3D Electromagnetic Scattering Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03774</link><description>arXiv:2508.03774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional computational electromagnetics (CEM) solvers can deliver high fidelity radar cross section (RCS) signatures by first solving the induced surface currents on 3-dimensional (3D) targets and then evaluating the scattered fields via radiation integrals. However, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for repeated queries and large-scale 3D scenarios. Recent purely data-driven networks improve efficiency, yet they often bypass this scattering mechanism, which may compromise physical consistency and generalization. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose U-PINet, a fully end-to-end, physics-informed hierarchical network for efficient RCS prediction via 3D electromagnetic scattering reconstruction. Once the scattering quantities are reconstructed, scattered fields and RCS can be evaluated for arbitrary observation directions via the radiation integral. U-PINet explicitly learns physics-consistent intermediate scattering representations by modeling local electromagnetic coupling and long-range radiation effects through a hierarchical operator design inspired by near-far field decomposition in fast solvers. A physics-guided graph neural network is incorporated to capture self- and mutual-coupling among mesh elements of complex targets, enabling physically interpretable intermediate representations. By embedding governing equations as residual constraints, U-PINet enables accurate object reconstruction of scattering quantities and consequently reliable RCS prediction across observation directions, while significantly reducing runtime. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that U-PINet achieves EM-solver-level RCS accuracy and 3D object reconstruction with orders-of-magnitude speedups, and generalizes well to unseen geometries under limited training data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.03774v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deliberative Reasoning Network: An Uncertainty-Driven Paradigm for Belief-Tracked Inference with Pretrained Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04339</link><description>arXiv:2508.04339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.04339v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Decision-Making with Deliberation: Meta-reviewing as a Document-grounded Dialogue</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05283</link><description>arXiv:2508.05283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely, we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform \emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code available at: https://github.com/UKPLab/eacl2026-meta-review-as-dialog</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05283v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Political Opinions Transfer Between Western Languages? An Analysis of Unaligned and Aligned Multilingual LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05553</link><description>arXiv:2508.05553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic, cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05553v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Memp: Exploring Agent Procedural Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06433</link><description>arXiv:2508.06433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory. Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a weaker model can also yield substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models, represented by DALL$\cdot$E and Midjourney, have gained huge popularity for creating realistic images. The quality of these images relies on the carefully engineered prompts, which have become valuable intellectual property. While skilled prompters showcase their AI-generated art on markets to attract buyers, this business incidentally exposes them to \textit{prompt stealing attacks}. Existing state-of-the-art attack techniques reconstruct the prompts from a fixed set of modifiers (i.e., style descriptions) with model-specific training, which exhibit restricted adaptability and effectiveness to diverse showcases (i.e., target images) and diffusion models.
  To alleviate these limitations, we propose Prometheus, a training-free, proxy-in-the-loop, search-based prompt-stealing attack, which reverse-engineers the valuable prompts of the showcases by interacting with a local proxy model. It consists of three innovative designs. First, we introduce dynamic modifiers, as a supplement to static modifiers used in prior works. These dynamic modifiers provide more details specific to the showcases, and we exploit NLP analysis to generate them on the fly. Second, we design a contextual matching algorithm to sort both dynamic and static modifiers. This offline process helps reduce the search space of the subsequent step. Third, we interact with a local proxy model to invert the prompts with a greedy search algorithm. Based on the feedback guidance, we refine the prompt to achieve higher fidelity. The evaluation results show that Prometheus successfully extracts prompts from popular platforms like PromptBase and AIFrog against diverse victim models, including Midjourney, Leonardo.ai, and DALL$\cdot$E, with an ASR improvement of 25.0\%. We also validate that Prometheus is resistant to extensive potential defenses, further highlighting its severity in practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.06837v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LoSemB: Logic-Guided Semantic Bridging for Inductive Tool Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07690</link><description>arXiv:2508.07690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tool learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for large language models (LLMs) to solve many real-world tasks. Nonetheless, with the tool repository rapidly expanding, it is impractical to contain all tools within the limited input length of LLMs. To alleviate these issues, researchers have explored incorporating a tool retrieval module to select the most relevant tools or represent tools as unique tokens within LLM parameters. However, most state-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools have been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the real-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently. When dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered during the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues, including the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of similarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes of mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical information from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic Bridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to mine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval without costly retraining. Specifically, LoSemB contains a logic-based embedding alignment module to mitigate distribution shifts and implements a relational augmented retrieval mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of similarity-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoSemB achieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining desirable effectiveness in the transductive setting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.07690v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constrained Black-Box Attacks Against Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09275</link><description>arXiv:2508.09275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning has rapidly evolved, offering state-of-the-art algorithms for real-world applications, including sensitive domains. However, a key challenge to its widespread adoption is the lack of a thorough investigation into its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Existing work predominantly focuses on training-time attacks or unrealistic scenarios, such as access to policy weights or the ability to train surrogate policies. In this paper, we investigate new vulnerabilities under more challenging and constrained conditions, assuming an adversary can only collect and perturb the observations of deployed agents. We also consider scenarios where the adversary has no access at all (no observations, actions, or weights). Our main approach is to generate perturbations that intentionally misalign how victim agents see their environment. Our approach is empirically validated on three benchmarks and 22 environments, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse algorithms and environments. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm is sample-efficient, requiring only 1,000 samples compared to the millions needed by previous methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.09275v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SSBE-PINN: A Sobolev Boundary Scheme Boosting Stability and Accuracy in Elliptic/Parabolic PDE Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10322</link><description>arXiv:2508.10322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), yet they often fail to achieve accurate convergence in the H1 norm, especially in the presence of boundary approximation errors. In this work, we propose a novel method called Sobolev-Stable Boundary Enforcement (SSBE), which redefines the boundary loss using Sobolev norms to incorporate boundary regularity directly into the training process. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that SSBE ensures bounded H1 error via a stability guarantee and derive generalization bounds that characterize its robustness under finite-sample regimes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear PDEs, including Poisson, heat, and elliptic problems, show that SSBE consistently outperforms standard PINNs in terms of both relative L2 and H1 errors, even in high-dimensional settings. The proposed approach offers a principled and practical solution for improving gradient fidelity and overall solution accuracy in neural network based PDE solvers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10322v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generating Compilers for Qubit Mapping and Routing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10781</link><description>arXiv:2508.10781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To evaluate a quantum circuit on a quantum processor, one must find a mapping from circuit qubits to processor qubits and plan the instruction execution while satisfying the processor's constraints. This is known as the qubit mapping and routing (QMR) problem. High-quality QMR solutions are key to maximizing the utility of scarce quantum resources and minimizing the probability of logical errors affecting computation. The challenge is that the landscape of quantum processors is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving. Given this diversity, dozens of papers have addressed the QMR problem for different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error correction schemes by a developing a new algorithm for a particular context. We present an alternative approach: automatically generating qubit mapping and routing compilers for arbitrary quantum processors. Though each QMR problem is different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a compact domain-specific language for specifying QMR problems and a powerful parametric algorithm that can be instantiated for any QMR specification. Our thorough evaluation on case studies of important QMR problems shows that generated compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of runtime and solution quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10781v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A2H-MAS: An Algorithm-to-HLS Multi-Agent System for Automated and Reliable FPGA Implementation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10904</link><description>arXiv:2508.10904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between algorithm development and hardware realization remains a persistent challenge, particularly in latency- and resource-constrained domains such as wireless communication. While MATLAB provides a mature environment for algorithm prototyping, translating these models into efficient FPGA implementations via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) often requires expert tuning and lengthy iterations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automating this process. However, existing approaches suffer from hallucinations, forgetting, limited domain expertise, and often overlook key performance metrics. To address these limitations, we present A2H-MAS, a modular and hierarchical multi-agent system. At the system level, A2H-MAS assigns clearly defined responsibilities to specialized agents and uses standardized interfaces and execution-based validation to ensure correctness and reproducibility. At the algorithmic level, it employs dataflow-oriented modular decomposition and algorithm-hardware co-design, recognizing that the choice of algorithm often has a larger impact on hardware efficiency than pragma-level optimization. Experiments on representative wireless communication algorithms show that A2H-MAS consistently produces functionally correct, resource-efficient, and latency-optimized HLS designs, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for complex hardware development workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10904v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FAIRGAMER: Evaluating Social Biases in LLM-Based Video Game NPCs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17825</link><description>arXiv:2508.17825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly enhanced or replaced traditional Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in video games. However, these LLM-based NPCs inherit underlying social biases (e.g., race or class), posing fairness risks during in-game interactions. To address the limited exploration of this issue, we introduce FairGamer, the first benchmark to evaluate social biases across three interaction patterns: transaction, cooperation, and competition. FairGamer assesses four bias types, including class, race, age, and nationality, across 12 distinct evaluation tasks using a novel metric, FairMCV. Our evaluation of seven frontier LLMs reveals that: (1) models exhibit biased decision-making, with Grok-4-Fast demonstrating the highest bias (average FairMCV = 76.9%); and (2) larger LLMs display more severe social biases, suggesting that increased model capacity inadvertently amplifies these biases. We release FairGamer at https://github.com/Anonymous999-xxx/FairGamer to facilitate future research on NPC fairness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.17825v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Whom We Trust, What We Fear: COVID-19 Fear and the Politics of Information</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20146</link><description>arXiv:2508.20146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered not only a global health crisis but also an infodemic, an overload of information from diverse sources influencing public perception and emotional responses. In this context, fear emerged as a central emotional reaction, shaped by both media exposure and demographic factors. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between individuals' self-reported levels of fear about COVID-19 and the information sources they rely on, across nine source categories, including medical experts, government institutions, media, and personal networks. In particular, we defined a score that ranks fear levels based on self-reported concerns about the pandemic, collected through the Delphi CTIS survey in the United States between May 2021 and June 2022. We found that both fear levels and information source usage closely follow COVID-19 infection trends, exhibit strong correlations within each group (fear levels across sources are strongly correlated, as are patterns of source usage), and vary significantly across demographic groups, particularly by age and education. Applying causal inference methods, we found that among age, education, and information source, the latter is the most influential factor affecting individuals' fear levels. We further quantified the impact of different information sources on fear by estimating the average treatment effect, indicating how each source alters fear relative to a control. Furthermore, we demonstrated that information source preferences can reliably match the political orientation of U.S. states. These findings highlight the importance of information ecosystem dynamics in shaping emotional and behavioral responses during large-scale crises.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.20146v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Digital Twin-Empowered Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent VNF Migration in Edge-Core Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20957</link><description>arXiv:2508.20957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for services and the rapid deployment of virtualized network functions (VNFs) pose significant challenges for achieving low-latency and energy-efficient orchestration in modern edge-core network infrastructures. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-empowered Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for intelligent VNF migration that jointly minimizes average end-to-end (E2E) delay and energy consumption. By formulating the VNF migration problem as a Markov Decision Process and utilizing the Advantage Actor-Critic model, the proposed framework enables adaptive and real-time migration decisions. A key innovation of the proposed framework is the integration of a DT module composed of a multi-task Variational Autoencoder and a multi-task Long Short-Term Memory network. This combination collectively simulates environment dynamics and generates high-quality synthetic experiences, significantly enhancing training efficiency and accelerating policy convergence. Simulation results demonstrate substantial performance gains, such as significant reductions in both average E2E delay and energy consumption, thereby establishing new benchmarks for intelligent VNF migration in edge-core networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.20957v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unraveling LLM Jailbreaks Through Safety Knowledge Neurons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01631</link><description>arXiv:2509.01631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%. Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.01631v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Mitigating Data Imbalance in Automated Speaking Assessment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03010</link><description>arXiv:2509.03010v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Establishing reliable and verifiable fingerprinting mechanisms is fundamental to controlling the unauthorized redistribution of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches face two major challenges: (a) ensuring imperceptibility, including resistance to statistical identification and avoidance of accidental activation during fingerprint construction, and (b) preserving both model utility and fingerprint detectability under subsequent model modifications. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end fingerprinting framework with two components. First, we design a rule-based code-mixing fingerprint (CF) that maps natural-query-like prompts to multi-candidate targets, reducing accidental triggering via high-complexity code-mixing formulations. Second, we introduce Multi-Candidate Editing (MCEdit), which jointly optimizes multi-candidate targets and enforces margins between target and non-target outputs to improve post-modification detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework provides a robust and practical solution for fingerprinting LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.03122v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language-Native Materials Processing Design by Lightly Structured Text Database and Reasoning Large Language Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06093</link><description>arXiv:2509.06093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials synthesis procedures are predominantly documented as narrative text in protocols and lab notebooks, rendering them inaccessible to conventional structured data optimization. This language-native nature poses a critical challenge for complex, multistage processes--such as the preparation of boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS)--where outcomes depend on path-dependent choices in exfoliation and functionalization. Here, we recast synthesis planning as a text reasoning task enabled by a lightly structured text database, which preserves the conditional logic and causal contexts essential for expert-like decision-making. Building on a heterogeneous schema that indexes both narrative excerpts and computable entities (e.g., reaction conditions), our system implements a hybrid retrieval engine to combine semantic context with precise parameter filtering. On top of this, the framework operates in two modes, i.e. retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which grounds recommendations in retrieved evidence modules, and experience-augmented reasoning (EAR), which uses iteratively refined text guides distilled from multi-source narrative data. Instead of suggesting single "optimal" settings, the system produces interpretable guidance aligned with expert reasoning patterns--hypotheses, parameter ranges, and citation-backed standard operating procedures--that support iterative planning and failure diagnosis. We validated this framework on the targeted exfoliation of BNNS, a process highly sensitive to multivariate constraints. The system successfully identified optimal combinations of grinding aids, milling configurations, and separation strategies from a wide range of literature-reported methods, which were experimentally verified to yield high-quality nanosheets, illustrating the potential of language-native reasoning to streamline critical operations in materials processing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06093v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] "Abuse Risks are Often Inherent to Product Features": Exploring AI Vendors' Bug Bounty and Responsible Disclosure Policies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06136</link><description>arXiv:2509.06136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As vendors adopt AI technologies, security researchers are working to uncover and fix related vulnerabilities, which is important given AI systems handle sensitive data and critical functions. This process relies on vendors receiving and rewarding AI vulnerability reports. To assess current practices, we analyzed the vulnerability disclosure policies of 264 AI vendors. We employed a mixed-methods approach, combining snapshot and longitudinal qualitative analysis, as well as comparing alignment with 320 AI incidents and 260 academic articles. Our analysis reveals that 36% of AI vendors have no established policy, and only 18% mention AI risks. Data access, authorization, and model extraction vulnerabilities are most consistently declared in-scope. Jailbreaking and hallucination are most commonly declared out-of-scope. We identify three profiles that reflect vendors' different positions toward AI vulnerabilities: proactive clarification (n = 46), silent (n = 115), and restrictive (n = 103). Our alignment results suggest that vendors may address AI vulnerability disclosure later than academic research and real-world incidents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06136v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Competitive Audio-Language Models with Data-Efficient Single-Stage Training on Public Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07526</link><description>arXiv:2509.07526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with audio remains underexplored despite audio's centrality to human communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably small amount of public audio data, less than 30K hours (5K unique), Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency, single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through extensive ablations, we find that common complexities such as curriculum learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on over 500K hours of data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.07526v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explaining Tournament Solutions with Minimal Supports</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09312</link><description>arXiv:2509.09312v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament?", a central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule, the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time algorithms to compute them for all solutions except for the weighted uncovered set, for which the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations for tournament solutions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.09312v5</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Weaker Assumptions for Asymmetric Trust</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09493</link><description>arXiv:2509.09493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In distributed systems with asymmetric trust, each participant is free to make its own trust assumptions about others, captured by an asymmetric quorum system. This contrasts with ordinary, symmetric quorum systems and threshold models, where trust assumptions are uniformly shared among participants. Fundamental problems like reliable broadcast and consensus are unsolvable in the asymmetric model if quorum systems satisfy only the classical properties of consistency and availability. Existing approaches overcome this by introducing stronger assumptions. We show that some of these assumptions are overly restrictive, so much so that they effectively eliminate the benefits of asymmetric trust. To address this, we propose a new approach to characterize asymmetric problems and, building upon it, present algorithms for reliable broadcast and consensus that require weaker assumptions than previous solutions. Our methods are general and can be extended to other core problems in systems with asymmetric trust.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.09493v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA) Using CancelOut Layer and a Projected Loss</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10011</link><description>arXiv:2509.10011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA), which identifies the underlying intrinsic dimension of a wide range of datasets whose samples lie on either linear or nonlinear manifolds. Beyond estimating the intrinsic dimension, IDEA is also able to reconstruct the original dataset after projecting it onto the corresponding latent space, which is structured using re-weighted double CancelOut layers. Our key contribution is the introduction of the projected reconstruction loss term, guiding the training of the model by continuously assessing the reconstruction quality under the removal of an additional latent dimension. We first assess the performance of IDEA on a series of theoretical benchmarks to validate its robustness. These experiments allow us to test its reconstruction ability and compare its performance with state-of-the-art intrinsic dimension estimators. The benchmarks show good accuracy and high versatility of our approach. Subsequently, we apply our model to data generated from the numerical solution of a vertically resolved one-dimensional free-surface flow, following a pointwise discretization of the vertical velocity profile in the horizontal direction, vertical direction, and time. IDEA succeeds in estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension and then reconstructs the original solution by working directly within the projection space identified by the network.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.10011v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cost-Free Personalization via Information-Geometric Projection in Bayesian Federated Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10132</link><description>arXiv:2509.10132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) combines uncertainty modeling with decentralized training, enabling the development of personalized and reliable models under data heterogeneity and privacy constraints. Existing approaches typically rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or variational inference, often incorporating personalization mechanisms to better adapt to local data distributions. In this work, we propose an information-geometric projection framework for personalization in parametric BFL. By projecting the global model onto a neighborhood of the user's local model, our method enables a tunable trade-off between global generalization and local specialization. Under mild assumptions, we show that this projection step is equivalent to computing a barycenter on the statistical manifold, allowing us to derive closed-form solutions and achieve cost-free personalization. We apply the proposed approach to a variational learning setup using the Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) optimizer and extend its application to general aggregation schemes in BFL. Empirical evaluations under heterogeneous data distributions confirm that our method effectively balances global and local performance with minimal computational overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.10132v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SAQ: Pushing the Limits of Vector Quantization through Code Adjustment and Dimension Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12086</link><description>arXiv:2509.12086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a critical role in applications such as search engines, recommender systems, and RAG for LLMs. Vector quantization (VQ), a crucial technique for ANNS, is commonly used to reduce space overhead and accelerate distance computations. However, despite significant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face challenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve accuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically partition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By prioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates more bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space quota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize dimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error. To speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first quantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized vectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive enumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical methods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ, Extended RabitQ). SAQ achieves up to 80% reduction in quantization error and accelerates encoding speed by over 80x compared to Extended RabitQ.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.12086v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Barycenters of Persistence Diagrams</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14904</link><description>arXiv:2509.14904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short paper presents a general approach for computing robust Wasserstein barycenters of persistence diagrams. The classical method consists in computing assignment arithmetic means after finding the optimal transport plans between the barycenter and the persistence diagrams. However, this procedure only works for the transportation cost related to the $q$-Wasserstein distance $W_q$ when $q=2$. We adapt an alternative fixed-point method to compute a barycenter diagram for generic transportation costs ($q &gt; 1$), in particular those robust to outliers, $q \in (1,2)$. We show the utility of our work in two applications: \emph{(i)} the clustering of persistence diagrams on their metric space and \emph{(ii)} the dictionary encoding of persistence diagrams. In both scenarios, we demonstrate the added robustness to outliers provided by our generalized framework.

Abstract: Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) addresses the challenge of detecting and removing landmines from conflict regions. Much of the life-saving operational knowledge produced by HMA agencies is buried in unstructured reports, limiting the transferability of information between agencies. To address this issue, we propose TextMineX: the first dataset, evaluation framework and ontology-guided large language model (LLM) pipeline for knowledge extraction from text in the HMA domain. TextMineX structures HMA reports into (subject, relation, object)-triples, thus creating domain-specific knowledge. To ensure real-world relevance, we utilized the dataset from our collaborator Cambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC). We further introduce a bias-aware evaluation framework that combines human-annotated triples with an LLM-as-Judge protocol to mitigate position bias in reference-free scoring. Our experiments show that ontology-aligned prompts improve extraction accuracy by up to 44.2%, reduce hallucinations by 22.5%, and enhance format adherence by 20.9% compared to baseline models.

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have emerged as powerful tools for speech-related tasks but remain underexplored for fine-tuning, especially with limited speech data. To bridge this gap, we systematically examine how different fine-tuning schemes including text-only, direct mixing, and curriculum learning affect spoken language understanding (SLU), focusing on scenarios where text-label pairs are abundant while paired speech-label data are limited. Results show that LALMs already achieve competitive performance with text-only fine-tuning, highlighting their strong generalization ability. Adding even small amounts of speech data (2-5%) yields substantial further gains, with curriculum learning particularly effective under scarce data. In cross-lingual SLU, combining source-language speech data with target-language text and minimal target-language speech data enables effective adaptation. Overall, this study provides practical insights into the LALM fine-tuning under realistic data constraints.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.15389v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Targeted Fine-Tuning of DNN-Based Receivers via Influence Functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15950</link><description>arXiv:2509.15950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first use of influence functions for deep learning-based wireless receivers.

Multi-target adaptation proved less effective, underscoring open challenges. Beyond experiments, we connect influence to self-influence corrections and propose a second-order, influence-aligned update strategy.

Abstract: Journaling can potentially serve as an effective method for autistic adolescents to improve narrative skills. However, its text-centric nature and high executive functioning demands present barriers to practice. We present Autiverse, an AI-guided multimodal journaling app for tablets that scaffolds storytelling through conversational prompts and visual supports. Autiverse elicits key details through a stepwise dialogue with peer-like, customizable AI and composes them into an editable four-panel comic strip. Through a two-week deployment study with 10 autistic adolescent-parent dyads, we examine how Autiverse supports autistic adolescents to organize their daily experience and emotion. Autiverse scaffolded adolescents' coherent narratives, while enabling parents to learn additional details of their child's events and emotions. The customized AI peer created a comfortable space for sharing, fostering enjoyment and a strong sense of agency. We discuss implications for adaptive scaffolding across autism profiles, socio-emotionally appropriate AI peer design, and balancing autonomy with parental involvement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.17466v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Achilles' Heel of Mamba: Essential difficulties of the Mamba architecture demonstrated by synthetic data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17514</link><description>arXiv:2509.17514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to attention mechanisms, with the Mamba architecture demonstrating impressive performance and linear complexity for processing long sequences. However, the fundamental differences between Mamba and Transformer architectures remain incompletely understood. In this work, we use carefully designed synthetic tasks to reveal Mamba's inherent limitations. Through experiments, we identify that Mamba's nonlinear convolution introduces an asymmetry bias that significantly impairs its ability to recognize symmetrical patterns and relationships. Using composite function and inverse sequence matching tasks, we demonstrate that Mamba strongly favors compositional solutions over symmetrical ones and struggles with tasks requiring the matching of reversed sequences. We show these limitations stem not from the SSM module itself but from the nonlinear convolution preceding it, which fuses token information asymmetrically. These insights provide a new understanding of Mamba's constraints and suggest concrete architectural improvements for future sequence models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.17514v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Pathways of Thoughts: Multi-Directional Thinking for Long-form Personalized Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19094</link><description>arXiv:2509.19094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalization is well studied in search and recommendation, but personalized question answering remains underexplored due to challenges in inferring preferences from long, noisy, implicit contexts and generating responses that are both accurate and aligned with user expectations. To address this, we propose Pathways of Thoughts (PoT), an inference-stage method that applies to any large language model (LLM) without task-specific fine-tuning. PoT models the thinking as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects among cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and clarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories, producing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT then aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user preferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the complementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark show that PoT consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to a 10.8\% relative improvement. Human evaluation further validates these improvements, with annotators preferring PoT in 66\% of cases compared to the best-performing baseline and reporting ties in 15\% of cases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19094v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PPGFlowECG: Latent Rectified Flow with Cross-Modal Encoding for PPG-Guided ECG Generation and Cardiovascular Disease Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19774</link><description>arXiv:2509.19774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) is the clinical gold standard for cardiovascular disease (CVD) assessment, yet continuous monitoring is constrained by the need for dedicated hardware and trained personnel. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is ubiquitous in wearable devices and readily scalable, but it lacks electrophysiological specificity, limiting diagnostic reliability. While generative methods aim to translate PPG into clinically useful ECG signals, existing approaches are limited by the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To address these limitations, we propose PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent space using the CardioAlign Encoder and then synthesizes ECGs with latent rectified flow. We further provide a formal analysis of this coupling, showing that the CardioAlign Encoder is necessary to guarantee stable and semantically consistent ECG synthesis under our formulation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate improved synthesis fidelity and downstream diagnostic utility. These results indicate that PPGFlowECG supports scalable, wearable-first CVD screening when standard ECG acquisition is unavailable.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19774v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context Parametrization with Compositional Adapters</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22158</link><description>arXiv:2509.22158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility. Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts. Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost, robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22158v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Next Point-of-interest (POI) Recommendation Model Based on Multi-modal Spatio-temporal Context Feature Embedding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22661</link><description>arXiv:2509.22661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the next pickup location of individual users is a fundamental problem in intelligent mobility systems, which requires modeling personalized travel behaviors under complex spatiotemporal contexts. Existing methods mainly learn sequential dependencies from raw trajectories, but often fail to capture high-level behavioral semantics and to effectively disentangle long-term habitual preferences from short-term contextual intentions. In this paper, we propose a semantic embedding based dual stream spatiotemporal attention model for next pickup location prediction. Raw trajectories are first transformed into semantically enriched activity sequences to encode users' stay behaviors and movement semantics. A dual stream architecture is then designed to explicitly decouple long-term historical patterns and short-term dynamic intentions, where each stream employs spatiotemporal attention mechanisms to model dependencies at different temporal scales. To integrate heterogeneous contextual information, a context aware dynamic fusion module adaptively balances the contributions of the two streams. Finally, an attention based matching strategy is used to predict the probability distribution over candidate pickup locations. Experiments on real world ride hailing datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state of the art methods, validating the effectiveness of semantic trajectory abstraction and dual stream spatiotemporal attention for individualized mobility behavior modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.22661v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Extendable Generalization Self-Supervised Diffusion for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23885</link><description>arXiv:2509.23885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current methods based on deep learning for self-supervised low-dose CT (LDCT) reconstruction, while reducing the dependence on paired data, face the problem of significantly decreased generalization when training with single-dose data and extending to other doses. To enable dose-extensive generalization using only single-dose projection data for training, this work proposes a novel method of Extendable GENeraLization self-supervised Diffusion (EGenDiff) for low-dose CT reconstruction. Specifically, a contextual subdata self-enhancing similarity strategy is designed to provide an initial prior for the subsequent progress. During training, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing image details. On the stage of inference, the pixel-wise self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for data fidelity enhancement, resulting in extensive generalization of higher and lower doses or even unseen doses. EGenDiff requires only LDCT projection data for training and testing. Comprehensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, clinical data, photon counting CT data, and across all three anatomical planes (transverse, coronal, and sagittal) demonstrates that EGenDiff enables extendable generalization multi-dose, yielding reconstructions that consistently outperform leading existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.23885v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Protocode: Prototype-Driven Interpretability for Code Generation in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25247</link><description>arXiv:2509.25247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have been widely adopted for various tasks such as text summarization, question answering, speech-to-text translation, and more. In recent times, the use of LLMs for code generation has gained significant attention, with tools such as Cursor and Windsurf demonstrating the ability to analyze massive code repositories and recommend relevant changes. Big tech companies have also acknowledged the growing reliance on LLMs for code generation within their codebases. Although these advances significantly improve developer productivity, increasing reliance on automated code generation can proportionally increase the risk of suboptimal solutions and insecure code. Our work focuses on automatically sampling In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations which can improve model performance and enhance the interpretability of the generated code. Using AST-based analysis on outputs from the MBPP test set, we identify regions of code most influenced by the chosen demonstrations. In our experiments, we show that high-quality ICL demonstrations not only make outputs easier to interpret but also yield a positive performance improvement on the pass@10 metric. Conversely, poorly chosen ICL demonstrations affected the LLM performance on the pass@10 metric negatively compared to the base model. Overall, our approach highlights the importance of efficient sampling strategies for ICL, which can affect the performance of the model on any given task.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25247v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bridging the Gap Between Simulated and Real Network Data Using Transfer Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00956</link><description>arXiv:2510.00956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML)-based network models provide fast and accurate predictions for complex network behaviors but require substantial training data. Collecting such data from real networks is often costly and limited, especially for critical scenarios like failures. As a result, researchers commonly rely on simulated data, which reduces accuracy when models are deployed in real environments.

Using RouteNet-Fermi, we show that fine-tuning a pre-trained model with a small real dataset significantly improves performance. Our experiments with OMNeT++ and a custom testbed reduce the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in packet delay prediction by up to 88%. With just 10 real scenarios, MAPE drops by 37%, and with 50 scenarios, by 48%.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.00956v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exploring Resolution-Wise Shared Attention in Hybrid Mamba-U-Nets for Improved Cross-Corpus Speech Enhancement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01958</link><description>arXiv:2510.01958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in speech enhancement have shown that models combining Mamba and attention mechanisms yield superior cross-corpus generalization performance. At the same time, integrating Mamba in a U-Net structure has yielded state-of-the-art enhancement performance, while reducing both model size and computational complexity. Inspired by these insights, we propose RWSA-MambaUNet, a novel and efficient hybrid model combining Mamba and multi-head attention in a U-Net structure for improved cross-corpus performance. Resolution-wise shared attention (RWSA) refers to layerwise attention-sharing across corresponding time- and frequency resolutions. Our best-performing RWSA-MambaUNet model achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on two out-of-domain test sets. Notably, our smallest model surpasses all baselines on the out-of-domain DNS 2020 test set in terms of PESQ, SSNR, and ESTOI, and on the out-of-domain EARS-WHAM_v2 test set in terms of SSNR, ESTOI, and SI-SDR, while using less than half the model parameters and a fraction of the FLOPs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01958v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Artifact Robustness for CT Deep Learning Models Without Labeled Artifact Images via Domain Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06584</link><description>arXiv:2510.06584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative, this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT dataset. We simulate the absence of labels from an unseen distribution via masking in the loss function and selectively detaching unlabeled instances from the computational graph. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach improves classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved a classification accuracy of 77.4% on ring artifact test data, 38.7% higher than a baseline model only trained on images with no artifact. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06584v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reading Between the Lines: Towards Reliable Black-box LLM Fingerprinting via Zeroth-order Gradient Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06605</link><description>arXiv:2510.06605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The substantial investment required to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) makes them valuable intellectual property, raising significant concerns about copyright protection. LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a key technique to address this, which aims to verify a model's origin by extracting an intrinsic, unique signature (a "fingerprint") and comparing it to that of a source model to identify illicit copies. However, existing black-box fingerprinting methods often fail to generate distinctive LLM fingerprints. This ineffectiveness arises because black-box methods typically rely on model outputs, which lose critical information about the model's unique parameters due to the usage of non-linear functions. To address this, we first leverage Fisher Information Theory to formally demonstrate that the gradient of the model's input is a more informative feature for fingerprinting than the output. Based on this insight, we propose ZeroPrint, a novel method that approximates these information-rich gradients in a black-box setting using zeroth-order estimation. ZeroPrint overcomes the challenge of applying this to discrete text by simulating input perturbations via semantic-preserving word substitutions. This operation allows ZeroPrint to estimate the model's Jacobian matrix as a unique fingerprint. Experiments on the standard benchmark show ZeroPrint achieves a state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming existing black-box methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06605v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PTEB: Towards Robust Text Embedding Evaluation via Stochastic Paraphrasing at Evaluation Time with LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06730</link><description>arXiv:2510.06730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current sentence embedding evaluations typically rely on static test beds like the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While invaluable, repeated tuning on a fixed suite can inflate reported scores and obscure real-world robustness. We introduce the Paraphrasing Text Embedding Benchmark (PTEB), a dynamic protocol that stochastically generates meaning-preserving paraphrases at evaluation time and aggregates results across multiple runs. Using a cost-efficient LLM-based method grounded in gold ratings and human validation, we show that LLMs generate token-diverse but semantically preserving paraphrases. Across 7 MTEB tasks, we validate our hypothesis that the performance of sentence encoders is sensitive to changes in token space even when semantics remain fixed. We also observe that smaller models are not disproportionately affected relative to larger ones. Our results are statistically robust over multiple runs spanning 20 datasets and 25 languages. More generally, we aim to propose a new evaluation paradigm in NLP that relies less on static, pre-defined benchmarks but shifts towards dynamic, stochastic evaluation leveraging eval-time compute.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06730v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do We Really Need SFT?

Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a key component of smart urban services, yet it remains challenging under cold-start conditions with sparse user-POI interactions. Recent LLM-based methods address this issue through either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or in-context learning (ICL), but SFT is costly and prone to overfitting active users, while static prompts in ICL lack adaptability to diverse user contexts. We argue that the main limitation lies not in LLM reasoning ability, but in how contextual evidence is constructed and presented. Accordingly, we propose Prompt-as-Policy over knowledge graphs (KG), a reinforcement-guided prompting framework that formulates prompt construction as a learnable decision process, while keeping the LLM frozen as a reasoning engine. To enable structured prompt optimization, we organize heterogeneous user-POI signals into a KG and transform mined relational paths into evidence cards, which serve as atomic semantic units for prompt composition. A contextual bandit learner then optimizes a prompt policy that adaptively determines (i) which relational evidences to include, (ii) how many evidences to retain per candidate POI, and (iii) how to organize and order them within the prompt. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that Prompt-as-Policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average 11.87% relative improvement in Acc@1 for inactive users, while maintaining competitive performance for active users, without any model fine-tuning.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08012v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08593</link><description>arXiv:2510.08593v2 Announce Type: replace

Although pretrained self-supervised learning (SSL) models provide rich representations, most recent SDD studies extract features from a single layer of the pretrained SSL model for the downstream classifier. This practice overlooks the complementary roles of low-level acoustic features and high-level semantic information inherently encoded in different SSL model layers. To explicitly model interactions between acoustic and semantic representations within an utterance, we propose a hierarchical adaptive representation encoder with prior knowledge that disengages and re-aligns acoustic and semantic information through asymmetric cross-attention, enabling fine-grained acoustic patterns to be interpreted in semantic context. In addition, a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) objective is applied as auxiliary supervision to handle the irregular temporal distribution of depressive characteristics without requiring frame-level annotations. Experiments on DAIC-WOZ and MODMA demonstrate that HAREN-CTC consistently outperforms existing methods under both performance upper-bound evaluation and generalization evaluation settings, achieving Macro F1 scores of 0.81 and 0.82 respectively in upper-bound evaluation, and maintaining superior performance with statistically significant improvements in precision and AUC under rigorous cross-validation. These findings suggest that modeling hierarchical acoustic-semantic interactions better reflects how depressive characteristics manifest in natural speech, enabling scalable and objective depression assessment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08593v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Single-Granularity Prompts: A Multi-Scale Chain-of-Thought Prompt Learning for Graph</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09394</link><description>arXiv:2510.09394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ``pre-train, prompt" paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework. Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method, particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations. Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability. Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.10111v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Extending Audio Context for Long-Form Understanding in Large Audio-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15231</link><description>arXiv:2510.15231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce Partial YaRN, a training-free, modality-decoupled extension method that modifies only audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training. Our experiments on SALMONN and Qwen2-Audio confirm that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide range of settings, and VLAT provides substantial performance improvement on long audio of unseen lengths.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.15231v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scaffold-Aware Generative Augmentation and Reranking for Enhanced Virtual Screening</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16306</link><description>arXiv:2510.16306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative models, specifically a graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.16306v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] What Makes AI Research Replicable?

Abstract: Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a pluggable, paper-centric knowledge base that automatically integrates code snippets and technical insights extracted from scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible solution for automated AI research replication.

Abstract: We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17932v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KBE-DME: Dynamic Multimodal Evaluation via Knowledge Enhanced Benchmark Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21182</link><description>arXiv:2510.21182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially, KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge. It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.21182v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conjugate Relation Modeling for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22656</link><description>arXiv:2510.22656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.22656v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] BEST-RQ-Based Self-Supervised Learning for Whisper Domain Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24570</link><description>arXiv:2510.24570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, despite large multilingual training, struggle in low-resource scenarios where labeled data is scarce. We propose BEARD (BEST-RQ Encoder Adaptation with Re-training and Distillation), a novel framework designed to adapt Whisper's encoder with unlabeled data. Unlike traditional self-supervised learning methods, BEARD uniquely combines a BEST-RQ objective with knowledge distillation from a frozen teacher encoder, ensuring the encoder's complementarity with the pre-trained decoder. Our experiments focus on the ATCO2 corpus from the challenging Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications domain, characterized by non-native speech, noise, and specialized phraseology. Using about 5,000 hours of untranscribed speech for BEARD and 2 hours of transcribed speech for fine-tuning, the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous baseline and fine-tuned model, achieving a relative improvement of 12% compared to the fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use a self-supervised learning objective for domain adaptation of Whisper.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.24570v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709</link><description>arXiv:2510.24709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a quadratic similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in DINO, CLIP, and ImageNet-supervised ViTs, but is markedly weaker in MAE, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.24709v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Configuration-First Framework for Reproducible, Low-Code Localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25692</link><description>arXiv:2510.25692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default, without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default, including versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs, and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models, metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization workflows, supporting location-based services, in particular. In this paper, we introduce a low-code, configuration-first framework in which experiments are declared in human-readable configuration files, a workflow orchestrator executes standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts, such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. We instantiate the framework as LOCALIZE with preconfigured, versioned datasets that reduce initial setup effort and boilerplate, thereby accelerating model development and evaluation. The design, with explicit extension points, allows experts to add components without reworking the underlying infrastructure. Through a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a example dataset, we demonstrate that scaling the training data from 1x to 10x keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25692v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Hybrid Finite-Volume Reconstruction Framework for Efficient High-Order Shock-Capturing on Unstructured Meshes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25906</link><description>arXiv:2510.25906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a multi-dimensional, arbitrary-order hybrid reconstruction framework for compressible flows on unstructured meshes. The method combines the efficiency of linear reconstruction with the robustness of high-order non-oscillatory schemes, activated only where needed through a novel a priori detection strategy. By minimising the use of costly CWENOZ and MUSCL reconstructions, the approach substantially reduces computational expense without sacrificing accuracy or stability. The framework blends CWENOZ formulations with the MOOD paradigm and introduces a redesigned Numerical Admissibility Detector that classifies the flow in a single step as smooth, weakly non-smooth, or discontinuous. Smooth regions use high-order linear reconstruction, weakly non-smooth regions use CWENOZ, and discontinuities are treated with second-order MUSCL. This targeted allocation preserves high-order accuracy while ensuring non-oscillatory and stable solutions near shocks. Implemented in the open-source unstructured finite-volume solver UCNS3D, the method supports arbitrary-order reconstruction on mixed-element meshes. Two- and three-dimensional benchmarks confirm the designed accuracy in smooth regions and enhanced robustness in shock-dominated flows. Reduced reliance on nonlinear reconstructions yields up to a 2.5x speed-up over same-order CWENOZ in 3D compressible turbulence simulations, bringing high-order accuracy closer to industrial-scale CFD applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25906v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NeuroClean: A Generalized Machine-Learning Approach to Neural Time-Series Conditioning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01951</link><description>arXiv:2511.01951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications. However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline. NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover, in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97% accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.01951v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Aligning Multimodal LLMs with Human Experts: A Focus on Parent-Child Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04366</link><description>arXiv:2511.04366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in human-centred AI systems, their ability to understand complex social interactions remains uncertain. We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting approach, separating observation from judgement. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.04366v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Causal Market Simulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04469</link><description>arXiv:2511.04469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal mechanisms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.04469v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context-aware Learned Mesh-based Simulation via Trajectory-Level Meta-Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05234</link><description>arXiv:2511.05234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization. However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties. Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.05234v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Translation via Annotation: A Computational Study of Translating Classical Chinese into Japanese</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05239</link><description>arXiv:2511.05239v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) differs from the traditional index-then-retrieve pipeline by storing relevance in model parameters and generating retrieval cues directly from the query, but it can be brittle out of domain and expensive to scale. We introduce QueStER (QUEry SpecificaTion for gEnerative Keyword-Based Retrieval), which bridges GR and query reformulation by learning to generate explicit keyword-based search specifications. Given a user query, a lightweight LLM produces a keyword query that is executed by a standard retriever (BM25), combining the generalization benefits of generative query rewriting with the efficiency and scalability of lexical indexing. We train the rewriting policy with reinforcement learning techniques. Across in- and out-of-domain evaluations, QueStER consistently improves over BM25 and is competitive with neural IR baselines, while maintaining strong efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.05301v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Registration-Free Monitoring of Unstructured Point Cloud Data via Intrinsic Geometrical Properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05623</link><description>arXiv:2511.05623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern sensing technologies have enabled the collection of unstructured point cloud data (PCD) of varying sizes, which are used to monitor the geometric accuracy of 3D objects. PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme designed to handle hundreds of features. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances. In the monitoring scheme, thresholding techniques are used to further select intrinsic features most indicative of potential out-of-control conditions. Numerical experiments and case studies highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying different types of defects.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.05623v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ConeGS: Error-Guided Densification Using Pixel Cones for Improved Reconstruction With Fewer Primitives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06810</link><description>arXiv:2511.06810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves state-of-the-art image quality and real-time performance in novel view synthesis but often suffers from a suboptimal spatial distribution of primitives. This issue stems from cloning-based densification, which propagates Gaussians along existing geometry, limiting exploration and requiring many primitives to adequately cover the scene. We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality. Experiments show that ConeGS consistently enhances reconstruction quality and rendering performance across Gaussian budgets, with especially strong gains under tight primitive constraints where efficient placement is crucial.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.06810v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sequential Causal Normal Form Games: Theory, Computation, and Strategic Signaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06934</link><description>arXiv:2511.06934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can classical game-theoretic frameworks be extended to capture the bounded rationality and causal reasoning of AI agents? We investigate this question by extending Causal Normal Form Games (CNFGs) to sequential settings, introducing Sequential Causal Multi-Agent Systems (S-CMAS) that incorporate Pearl's Causal Hierarchy across leader-follower interactions. While theoretically elegant -- we prove PSPACE-completeness, develop equilibrium refinements, and establish connections to signaling theory -- our comprehensive empirical investigation reveals a critical limitation: S-CNE provides zero welfare improvement over classical Stackelberg equilibrium across all tested scenarios. Through 50+ Monte Carlo simulations and hand-crafted synthetic examples, we demonstrate that backward induction with rational best-response eliminates any strategic advantage from causal layer distinctions. We construct a theoretical example illustrating conditions where benefits could emerge ($\epsilon$-rational satisficing followers), though implementation confirms that even relaxed rationality assumptions prove insufficient when good instincts align with optimal play. This negative result provides valuable insight: classical game-theoretic extensions grounded in rational choice are fundamentally incompatible with causal reasoning advantages, motivating new theoretical frameworks beyond standard Nash equilibrium for agentic AI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.06934v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Boundaries: Leveraging Vision Foundation Models for Source-Free Object Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07301</link><description>arXiv:2511.07301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) aims to adapt a source-pretrained object detector to a target domain without access to source data. However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art SFOD performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VFMs to simultaneously improve transferability and discriminability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.07301v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enabling Agents to Communicate Entirely in Latent Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09149</link><description>arXiv:2511.09149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by telepathy, which bypasses symbolic language in communication, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the continuous last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its thought for direct communication (termed latent communication). An additional learned compression process further compresses latent communication via latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, even across heterogeneous models, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference by up to 24 times but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09149v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] End-to-end Contrastive Language-Speech Pretraining Model For Long-form Spoken Question Answering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09282</link><description>arXiv:2511.09282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spoken question answering (SQA) in recent years. However, many existing methods, including large audio language models, struggle with processing long audio. Follow the success of retrieval augmented generation, a speech-related retriever shows promising in help preprocessing long-form speech. But the performance of existing speech-related retrievers is lacking. To address this challenge, we propose CLSR, an end-to-end contrastive language-speech retriever that efficiently extracts question-relevant segments from long audio recordings for downstream SQA task. Unlike conventional speech-text contrastive models, CLSR incorporates an intermediate step that converts acoustic features into text-like representations prior to alignment, thereby more effectively bridging the gap between modalities. Experimental results across four cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that CLSR surpasses both end-to-end speech related retrievers and pipeline approaches combining speech recognition with text retrieval, providing a robust foundation for advancing practical long-form SQA applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09282v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Seer Self-Consistency: Advance Budget Estimation for Adaptive Test-Time Scaling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09345</link><description>arXiv:2511.09345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09345v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Intrinsic Dimensionality as a Model-Free Measure of Class Imbalance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10475</link><description>arXiv:2511.10475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) chatbots built for mental health could deliver safe, personalized, and scalable mental health support. We evaluate a foundation model designed for mental health. Adults completed mental health measures while engaging with the chatbot between May 15, 2025 and September 15, 2025. Users completed an opt-in consent, demographic information, mental health symptoms, social connection, and self-identified goals. Measures were repeated every two weeks up to 6 weeks, and a final follow-up at 10 weeks. Analyses included effect sizes, and growth mixture models to identify participant groups and their characteristic engagement, severity, and demographic factors. Users demonstrated significant reductions in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 that were sustained at follow-up. Significant improvements in Hope, Behavioral Activation, Social Interaction, Loneliness, and Perceived Social Support were observed throughout and maintained at 10 week follow-up. Engagement was high and predicted outcomes. Working alliance was comparable to traditional care and predicted outcomes. Automated safety guardrails functioned as designed, with 76 sessions flagged for risk and all handled according to escalation policies. This single arm naturalistic observational study provides initial evidence that a GAI foundation model for mental health can deliver accessible, engaging, effective, and safe mental health support. These results lend support to findings from early randomized designs and offer promise for future study of mental health GAI in real world settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.11689v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Data-integrated neural networks for solving partial differential equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12055</link><description>arXiv:2511.12055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose data-integrated neural networks (DataInNet) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), offering a novel approach to leveraging data (e.g., source terms, initial conditions, and boundary conditions). The core of this work lies in the integration of data into a unified network framework. DataInNet comprises two subnetworks: a data integration neural network responsible for accommodating and fusing various types of data, and a fully connected neural network dedicated to learning the residual physical information not captured by the physics integration neural network. This network architecture inherently excludes function classes that violate known physical constraints, thereby substantially narrowing the solution search space. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DataInNet delivers superior performance on challenging problems, such as the Helmholtz equation (relative \(L^2\) error: O(\(10^{-6}\))) and PDEs with high frequency solutions (relative \(L^2\) error: O(\(10^{-5}\))).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.12055v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Towards Reinforcement Learning from Neural Feedback: Mapping fNIRS Signals to Agent Performance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12844</link><description>arXiv:2511.12844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a methodology that aligns agent behavior with human preferences by integrating user feedback into the agent's training process. This paper introduces a framework that guides agent training through implicit neural signals, with a focus on the neural classification problem. Our work presents and releases a novel dataset of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings collected from 25 human participants across three domains: Pick-and-Place Robot, Lunar Lander, and Flappy Bird. We train multiple classifiers to predict varying levels of agent performance (optimal, suboptimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS features, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary and 46% for multi-class classification across conditions and domains. We also train multiple regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policy actions, providing a continuous measure of performance. Finally, we evaluate cross-subject generalization and show that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively. Our results demonstrate that mapping implicit fNIRS signals to agent performance is feasible and can be improved, laying the foundation for future Reinforcement Learning from Neural Feedback (RLNF) systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.12844v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Finding Kissing Numbers with Game-theoretic Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13391</link><description>arXiv:2511.13391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since Isaac Newton first studied the Kissing Number Problem in 1694, determining the maximal number of non-overlapping spheres around a central sphere has remained a fundamental challenge. This problem represents the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem on sphere packing, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game that can be fully parallelized at large scale, and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions, discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions, and establishes new records for generalized kissing configurations under various angular constraints. These results demonstrate AI's power to explore high-dimensional spaces beyond human intuition and open new pathways for the Kissing Number Problem and broader geometry problems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.13391v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] T2T-VICL: Unlocking the Boundaries of Cross-Task Visual In-Context Learning via Implicit Text-Driven VLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16107</link><description>arXiv:2511.16107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across twelve cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in nine additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.16107v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM4EO: Large Language Model for Evolutionary Optimization in Flexible Job Shop Scheduling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16485</link><description>arXiv:2511.16485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Customized static operator design has enabled widespread application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but their search performance is transient during iterations and prone to degradation. Dynamic operators aim to address this but typically rely on predefined designs and localized parameter control during the search process, lacking adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for Evolutionary Optimization (LLM4EO), comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, initialization of operators is performed by transferring the strengths of classical operators via LLMs. Then, search preferences and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance and evolutionary features, accompanied by corresponding suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, gene selection priorities of operators are dynamically optimized via improvement prompting strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of populations and operators in the search, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, a series of validations on multiple benchmark datasets of the flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms both mainstream evolutionary programming and traditional EAs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.16485v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Computing the Nucleolus: An Assessment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16517</link><description>arXiv:2511.16517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Maggiorano et al. (2025) claimed that they have developed a strongly polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm for the nucleolus in convex games that is based on the reduced game approach and submodular function minimization method. Thereby, avoiding the ellipsoid method with its negative side effects in numerical computation completely. However, we shall argue that this is a fallacy based on an incorrect application of the Davis/Maschler reduced game property (RGP). Ignoring the fact that despite the pre-nucleolus, other solutions like the core, pre-kernel, and semi-reactive pre-bargaining set possess this property as well. This causes a severe selection issue, leading to the failure to compute the nucleolus of convex games using the reduced games approach. In order to assess this finding in its context, the ellipsoid method of Faigle et al. (2001) and the Fenchel-Moreau conjugation-based approach from convex analysis of Meinhardt (2013) to compute a pre-kernel element were resumed. In the latter case, it was exploited that for TU games with a single-valued pre-kernel, both solution concepts coincide. Implying that one has computed the pre-nucleolus if one has found the sole pre-kernel element of the game. Though it is a specialized and highly optimized algorithm for the pre-kernel, it assures runtime complexity of O(n^3) for computing the pre-nucleolus whenever the pre-kernel is a single point, which indicates a polynomial-time algorithm for this class of games.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.16517v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261</link><description>arXiv:2511.18261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.18261v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Layered Protocol Architecture for the Internet of Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19699</link><description>arXiv:2511.19699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements and the ability to learn domain-specific languages (DSLs), including APIs and tool interfaces. This capability has enabled the creation of AI agents that can perform preliminary computations and act through tool calling, which is now being standardized via protocols like MCP. However, LLMs face fundamental limitations: their context windows cannot grow indefinitely, restricting their memory and computational capacity. Agent collaboration emerges as essential for solving increasingly complex problems, mirroring how computational systems rely on different types of memory to scale. The "Internet of Agents" (IoA) represents the communication stack that enables agents to scale by distributing computation across collaborating entities.
  Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an Agent Communication Layer (L8) and an Agent Semantic Layer (L9). L8 formalizes the structure of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP. The proposed L9 layer: (1) formalizes semantic context discovery and negotiation, (2) provides semantic grounding by binding terms to semantic context, and (3) semantically validates incoming prompts and performs disambiguation as needed. Furthermore, L9 introduces primitives for coordination and consensus, allowing agents to achieve alignment on shared states, collective goals, and distributed beliefs. Together, these layers provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.19699v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Server FL with Overlapping Clients: A Latency-Aware Relay Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00025</link><description>arXiv:2512.00025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-server Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate communication bottlenecks of single-server FL. In a typical multi-server FL architecture, the regions covered by different edge servers (ESs) may overlap. Under this architecture, clients located in the overlapping areas can access edge models from multiple ESs. Building on this observation, we propose a cloud-free multi-server FL framework that leverages Overlapping Clients (OCs) as relays for inter-server model exchange while uploading the local updated model to ESs. This enables ES models to be relayed across multiple hops through neighboring ESs by OCs without introducing new communication links. We derive a new convergence upper bound for non-convex objectives under non-IID data and an arbitrary number of cells, which explicitly quantifies the impact of inter-server propagation depth on convergence error. Guided by this theoretical result, we formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize dissemination range of each ES model among all ESs within a limited latency. To solve this problem, we develop a conflict-graph-based local search algorithm optimizing the routing strategy and scheduling the transmission times of individual ESs to its neighboring ESs. This enables ES models to be relayed across multiple hops through neighboring ESs by OCs, achieving the widest possible transmission coverage for each model without introducing new communication links. Extensive experimental results show remarkable performance gains of our scheme compared to existing methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.00025v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Assertion-Conditioned Compliance: A Provenance-Aware Vulnerability in Multi-Turn Tool-Calling Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00332</link><description>arXiv:2512.00332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-turn tool-calling LLMs (models capable of invoking external APIs or tools across several user turns) have emerged as a key feature in modern AI assistants, enabling extended dialogues from benign tasks to critical business, medical, and financial operations. Yet implementing multi-turn pipelines remains difficult for many safety-critical industries due to ongoing concerns regarding model resilience. While standardized benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) have underpinned confidence concerning advanced function-calling models (like Salesforce's xLAM V2), there is still a lack of visibility into multi-turn conversation-level robustness, especially given their exposure to real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce Assertion-Conditioned Compliance (A-CC), a novel evaluation paradigm for multi-turn function-calling dialogues. A-CC provides holistic metrics that evaluate a model's behavior when confronted with misleading assertions originating from two distinct vectors: (1) user-sourced assertions (USAs), which measure sycophancy toward plausible but misinformed user beliefs, and (2) function-sourced assertions (FSAs), which measure compliance with plausible but contradictory system policies (e.g., stale hints from unmaintained tools). Our results show that models are highly vulnerable to both USA sycophancy and FSA policy conflicts, confirming A-CC as a critical, latent vulnerability in deployed agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.00332v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Difference Decomposition Networks for Infrared Small Target Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03470</link><description>arXiv:2512.03470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) faces two major challenges: a lack of discernible target texture and severe background clutter, which results in the background obscuring the target. To enhance targets and suppress backgrounds, we propose the Basis Decomposition Module (BDM) as an extensible and lightweight module based on basis decomposition, which decomposes a complex feature into several basis features and enhances certain information while eliminating redundancy. Extending BDM leads to a series of modules, including the Spatial Difference Decomposition Module (SD$^\mathrm{2}$M), Spatial Difference Decomposition Downsampling Module (SD$^\mathrm{3}$M), and Temporal Difference Decomposition Module (TD$^\mathrm{2}$M). Based on these modules, we develop the Spatial Difference Decomposition Network (SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net) for single-frame ISTD (SISTD) and the Spatiotemporal Difference Decomposition Network (STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net) for multi-frame ISTD (MISTD). SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net integrates SD$^\mathrm{2}$M and SD$^\mathrm{3}$M within an adapted U-shaped architecture. We employ TD$^\mathrm{2}$M to introduce motion information, which transforms SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net into STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net. Extensive experiments on SISTD and MISTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. On the SISTD task, SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net performs well compared to most established networks. On the MISTD datasets, STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net achieves a mIoU of 87.68\%, outperforming SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net, which achieves a mIoU of 64.97\%.

Abstract: Digital geographic maps remain largely inaccessible to blind and low-vision individuals (BLVIs), despite global legislation adopting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). A critical gap exists in defining "equivalent purpose" for maps under WCAG Success Criterion 1.1.1, which requires that non-text content provide a text alternative that serves the "equivalent purpose". This paper proposes a systematic framework for evaluating map accessibility, called the Map Equivalent-Purpose Framework (MEP Framework), defining purpose through three items (Generalized, Spatial Information, and Spatial Relationships), and establishing 15 measurable criteria for equivalent information communication. Eight text map representations were evaluated against visual map baselines using the proposed MEP Framework. Results show that legacy methods such as tables and turn-by-turn directions fail to meet the MEP Framework criteria, while Audiom Maps, Multi User Domain (MUD) Maps, and Audio Descriptions meet the criteria. The evaluation highlights the necessity of holistic, systematic approaches to ensure non-visual maps convey all generalized spatial information and relationships present in visual maps. The MEP Framework provides a replicable methodology for comprehensively assessing digital map accessibility, clarifying WCAG's "equivalent purpose", and guiding compliant and usable map creation.

Abstract: Interleaved reasoning paradigms enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual feedback but are hindered by the prohibitive computational cost of re-encoding pixel-dense images. A promising alternative, latent visual reasoning, circumvents this bottleneck yet faces limitations: methods either fail to capture intermediate state evolution due to single-step, non-interleaved structures, or sacrifice precise perceptual modeling by over-compressing features. We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. Specifically, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a momentum teacher model selectively distills relevant features from ground-truth intermediate images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR outperforms existing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained perception and sequential multimodal reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/XD111ds/ILVR.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05665v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] $\mathrm{D}^\mathrm{3}$-Predictor: Noise-Free Deterministic Diffusion for Dense Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07062</link><description>arXiv:2512.07062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although diffusion models with strong visual priors have emerged as powerful dense prediction backbones, they overlook a core limitation: the stochastic noise at the core of diffusion sampling is inherently misaligned with dense prediction that requires a deterministic mapping from image to geometry. In this paper, we show that this stochastic noise corrupts fine-grained spatial cues and pushes the model toward timestep-specific noise objectives, consequently destroying meaningful geometric structure mappings. To address this, we introduce $\mathrm{D}^\mathrm{3}$-Predictor, a noise-free deterministic diffusion-based dense prediction model built by reformulating a pretrained diffusion model without stochasticity noise. Instead of relying on noisy inputs to leverage diffusion priors, $\mathrm{D}^\mathrm{3}$-Predictor views the pretrained diffusion network as an ensemble of timestep-dependent visual experts and self-supervisedly aggregates their heterogeneous priors into a single, clean, and complete geometric prior. Meanwhile, we utilize task-specific supervision to seamlessly adapt this noise-free prior to dense prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on various dense prediction tasks demonstrate that $\mathrm{D}^\mathrm{3}$-Predictor achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios. In addition, it requires less than half the training data previously used and efficiently performs inference in a single step. Our code, data, and checkpoints are publicly available at https://x-gengroup.github.io/HomePage_D3-Predictor/.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.07062v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On LLMs' Internal Representation of Code Correctness</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07404</link><description>arXiv:2512.07404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for code generation, they often output incorrect code. One reason is that model output probabilities are often not well-correlated with correctness, and reflect only the final output of the generation process. Inspired by findings that LLMs internally encode concepts like truthfulness, this paper explores if LLMs similarly represent code correctness. Specifically, we identify a correctness representation inside LLMs by contrasting the hidden states between pairs of correct and incorrect code for the same programming tasks. By experimenting on four LLMs, we show that exploiting this extracted correctness representation outperforms standard log-likelihood ranking, as well as verbalized model confidence. Furthermore, we explore how this internal correctness signal can be used to select higher-quality code samples, without requiring test execution. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how leveraging internal representations can enhance code generation systems and make LLMs more reliable, thus improving confidence in automatically generated code.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.07404v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PrivTune: Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Device-Cloud Collaboration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08809</link><description>arXiv:2512.08809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of large language models, service providers offer language models as a service, enabling users to fine-tune customized models via uploaded private datasets. However, this raises concerns about sensitive data leakage. Prior methods, relying on differential privacy within device-cloud collaboration frameworks, struggle to balance privacy and utility, exposing users to inference attacks or degrading fine-tuning performance. To address this, we propose PrivTune, an efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning framework via Split Learning (SL). The key idea of PrivTune is to inject crafted noise into token representations from the SL bottom model, making each token resemble the $n$-hop indirect neighbors. PrivTune formulates this as an optimization problem to compute the optimal noise vector, aligning with defense-utility goals. On this basis, it then adjusts the parameters (i.e., mean) of the $d_\chi$-Privacy noise distribution to align with the optimization direction and scales the noise according to token importance to minimize distortion. Experiments on five datasets (covering both classification and generation tasks) against three embedding inversion and three attribute inference attacks show that, using RoBERTa on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset, PrivTune reduces the attack success rate to 10% with only a 3.33% drop in utility performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.08809v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Designing AI-Resilient Assessments Using Interconnected Problems: A Theoretically Grounded and Empirically Validated Framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10758</link><description>arXiv:2512.10758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI tools has rendered traditional modular assessments in computing and data-centric education increasingly ineffective, creating a disconnect between academic evaluation and authentic skill measurement. This paper presents a theoretically grounded framework for designing AI-resilient assessments, supported by formal analysis and empirical validation.
  We make three primary contributions. First, we establish two formal propositions. (1) Assessments composed of interconnected problems, in which outputs serve as inputs to subsequent tasks, are inherently more AI-resilient than modular assessments due to their reliance on multi-step reasoning and sustained context. (2) Semi-structured problems with deterministic success criteria provide more reliable measures of student competency than fully open-ended projects, which allow AI systems to default to familiar solution templates. These results challenge widely cited recommendations in recent institutional and policy guidance that promote open-ended assessments as inherently more robust to AI assistance.
  Second, we validate these propositions through empirical analysis of three university data science courses (N = 117). We observe a substantial AI inflation effect: students achieve near-perfect scores on AI-assisted modular homework, while performance drops by approximately 30 percentage points on proctored exams (Cohen d = 1.51). In contrast, interconnected projects remain strongly aligned with modular assessments (r = 0.954, p &lt; 0.001) while maintaining AI resistance, whereas proctored exams show weaker alignment (r = 0.726, p &lt; 0.001).
  Third, we translate these findings into a practical assessment design procedure that enables educators to construct evaluations that promote deeper engagement, reflect industry practice, and resist trivial AI delegation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10758v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Does Less Hallucination Mean Less Creativity?

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning, but suffer from hallucination: the generation of factually incorrect content. While numerous methods have been developed to reduce hallucinations, their impact on creative generations remains unexplored. This gap is particularly critical for AI-assisted scientific discovery, which requires both factual accuracy and creative hypothesis generation. We investigate how three hallucination-reduction techniques: Chain of Verification (CoVe), Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), affect creativity in LLMs. Evaluating multiple model families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral) at varying scales (1B - 70B parameters) on two creativity benchmarks (NeoCoder and CS4), we find that these methods have opposing effects on divergent creativity. CoVe enhances divergent thinking, DoLa suppresses it, and RAG shows minimal impact. Our findings provide guidance for selecting appropriate hallucination-reduction methods in scientific applications, where the balance between factual accuracy and creative exploration is crucial.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11509v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Smudged Fingerprints: A Systematic Evaluation of the Robustness of AI Image Fingerprints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11771</link><description>arXiv:2512.11771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model fingerprint detection has shown promise to trace the provenance of AI-generated images in forensic applications. However, despite the inherent adversarial nature of these applications, existing evaluations rarely consider adversarial settings. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success varies significantly across targeted models. We also observe a utility-robustness trade-off: accurate attribution methods are often vulnerable to attacks and, although some techniques are robust in specific settings, none achieves robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques that balance robustness and accuracy, and we identify the most promising approaches toward this goal.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming work, creativity, and economic security in ways that extend beyond automation and productivity. This paper examines four interconnected dimensions of contemporary AI deployment: (1) transformations in employment and task composition (2) unequal diffusion of AI across sectors and socio-demographic groups (3) the role of universal basic income (UBI) as a stabilising response to AI-induced volatility (4) the effects of model alignment and content governance on human creativity, autonomy, and decision-making
  Using a hybrid approach that integrates labour market task exposure modelling, sectoral diffusion analysis, policy review, and qualitative discourse critique, the study develops an Inclusive AI Governance Framework. It introduces Level 1.5 autonomy as a human centred design principle that preserves evaluative authority while enabling partial automation, and highlights evidence of creative regression and emergent sycophancy in newer model generations. The paper argues that UBI should be embedded within a broader socio-technical governance ecosystem encompassing skills development, proportional regulation, and creativity preservation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11893v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GraphPerf-RT: A Graph-Driven Performance Model for Hardware-Aware Scheduling of OpenMP Codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12091</link><description>arXiv:2512.12091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous AI agents on embedded platforms require real-time, risk-aware scheduling under resource and thermal constraints. Classical heuristics struggle with workload irregularity, tabular regressors discard structural information, and model-free reinforcement learning (RL) risks overheating. We introduce GraphPerf-RT, a graph neural network surrogate achieving deep learning accuracy at heuristic speeds (2-7ms). GraphPerf-RT is, to our knowledge, the first to unify task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Evidential regression with Normal-Inverse-Gamma priors provides calibrated uncertainty; we validate on makespan prediction for risk-aware scheduling. Experiments on three ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Orin NX, RUBIK Pi) achieve R^2 = 0.81 on log-transformed makespan with Spearman rho = 0.95 and conservative uncertainty calibration (PICP = 99.9% at 95% confidence). Integration with four RL methods demonstrates that multi-agent model-based RL with GraphPerf-RT as the world model achieves 66% makespan reduction and 82% energy reduction versus model-free baselines, with zero thermal violations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.12091v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Teaching Spell Checkers to Teach: Pedagogical Program Synthesis for Interactive Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12115</link><description>arXiv:2512.12115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spelling taught through memorization often fails many learners, particularly children with language-based learning disorders who struggle with the phonological skills necessary to spell words accurately. Educators such as speech-language pathologists (SLPs) address this instructional gap by using an inquiry-based approach to teach spelling that targets the phonology, morphology, meaning, and etymology of words. Yet, these strategies rarely appear in everyday writing tools, which simply detect and autocorrect errors. We introduce SPIRE (Spelling Inquiry Engine), a spell check system that brings this inquiry-based pedagogy into the act of composition. SPIRE implements Pedagogical Program Synthesis, a novel approach for operationalizing the inherently dynamic pedagogy of spelling instruction. SPIRE represents SLP instructional moves in a domain-specific language, synthesizes tailored programs in real-time from learner errors, and renders them as interactive interfaces for inquiry-based interventions. With SPIRE, spelling errors become opportunities to explore word meanings, word structures, morphological families, word origins, and grapheme-phoneme correspondences, supporting metalinguistic reasoning alongside correction. Evaluation with SLPs and learners shows alignment with professional practice and potential for integration into writing workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.12115v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Market-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models on Introductory Quantitative Trading and Market Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12264</link><description>arXiv:2512.12264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce MARKET-BENCH, a benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on introductory quantitative trading tasks by asking them to construct executable backtesters from natural language strategy descriptions and market assumptions. Each instance specifies one of three canonical strategies: scheduled trading on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), pairs trading on Coca-Cola (NASDAQ: KO) and Pepsi (NASDAQ: PEP), or delta hedging on MSFT. Models must produce code whose profit and loss (P and L), drawdown, and position paths match a verifiable reference implementation. We assess thirteen state-of-the-art models using a multi-round evaluation that separates structural reliability (whether the backtest runs) from numerical accuracy (mean absolute error of the backtest metrics), assigning failed outputs a duplicated-metrics baseline MAE. While most models reliably execute the simplest strategy (average executable passes of 4.08 out of 5 rounds), errors vary by orders of magnitude across models and tasks. Gemini 3 Pro and Claude 4.5 Sonnet combine strong reliability with low error on simpler strategies. GPT-5.2 achieves strong overall performance with perfect executability. GPT-5.1 Codex-Max achieves the lowest best-run error on the easiest task. Qwen3 Max attains perfect executability yet sometimes produces inaccurate profit and loss paths. These results show that current LLMs can scaffold basic trading infrastructure but still struggle to reason robustly about prices, inventory, and risk.

Abstract: Automatic polyp segmentation is crucial for improving the clinical identification of colorectal cancer (CRC). While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been extensively researched for this problem, current methods frequently struggle with generalization, particularly in data-constrained or challenging settings. Moreover, many existing polyp segmentation methods rely on complex, task-specific architectures. To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the intrinsic robustness of DINO self-attention "key" features for robust segmentation. Unlike traditional methods that extract tokens from the deepest layers of the Vision Transformer (ViT), our approach leverages the key features of the self-attention module with a simple convolutional decoder to predict polyp masks, resulting in enhanced performance and better generalizability. We validate our approach using a multi-center dataset under two rigorous protocols: Domain Generalization (DG) and Extreme Single Domain Generalization (ESDG). Our results, supported by a comprehensive statistical analysis, demonstrate that this pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly enhancing generalization, particularly in data-scarce and challenging scenarios. While avoiding a polyp-specific architecture, we surpass well-established models like nnU-Net and UM-Net. Additionally, we provide a systematic benchmark of the DINO framework's evolution, quantifying the specific impact of architectural advancements on downstream polyp segmentation performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.13376v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context-Picker: Dynamic context selection using multi-stage reinforcement learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14465</link><description>arXiv:2512.14465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In long-context question answering, selecting the appropriate scope of context for a query remains a key and unresolved challenge. Insufficient context can lead to missing essential information, whereas excessive context often introduces noise and degrades answer quality. Conventional methods, such as retrieving a fixed number of passages or applying reranking, struggle to dynamically determine which context to include. This is especially problematic for factoid questions, which typically depend only on a few precise pieces of evidence. To overcome this limitation, we propose Context-Picker, a reasoning-aware framework that reframes context selection as the task of identifying a minimal sufficient evidence subset, moving beyond conventional similarity-based ranking. Context-Picker uses a human-inspired two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: stage 1 focuses on improving the recall rate of critical passages, and stage 2 prioritizes pruning redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines ``minimal sufficient sets" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense and task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong RAG baselines and achieved higher answer accuracy. Ablation studies also indicate that our coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, along with the rationale generated by the policy, all contribute substantially to these gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.14465v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Can Synthetic Images Serve as Effective and Efficient Class Prototypes?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17160</link><description>arXiv:2512.17160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot image classification tasks. However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing. Experimental results validate the feasibility and efficiency of LGCLIP, demonstrating great performance in zero-shot classification tasks and establishing a novel paradigm for classification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.17160v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Stewardship of an LLM-Assisted Clinical Benchmark with Physician Oversight</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19691</link><description>arXiv:2512.19691v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20260v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CRAFT: Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning for Multimodal Text-to-Image Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20362</link><description>arXiv:2512.20362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping. We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free and model-agnostic framework for multimodal image generation. CRAFT transforms a user prompt into a set of explicit, dependency-structured visual constraints, verifies generated images using a vision-language model, and performs targeted prompt updates only when specific constraints are violated. This iterative process includes an explicit stopping criterion, resulting in an interpretable and controllable inference-time refinement loop. Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20362v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiEC: Diffusion Embedded Clustering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20905</link><description>arXiv:2512.20905v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep clustering methods typically rely on a single, well-defined representation for clustering. In contrast, pretrained diffusion models provide abundant and diverse multi-scale representations across network layers and noise timesteps. However, a key challenge is how to efficiently identify the most clustering-friendly representation in the layer*timestep space. To address this issue, we propose Diffusion Embedded Clustering (DiEC), an unsupervised framework that performs clustering by leveraging optimal intermediate representations from pretrained diffusion models. DiEC systematically evaluates the clusterability of representations along the trajectory of network depth and noise timesteps. Meanwhile, an unsupervised search strategy is designed for recognizing the Clustering-optimal Layer (COL) and Clustering-optimal Timestep (COT) in the layer*timestep space of pretrained diffusion models, aiming to promote clustering performance and reduce computational overhead. DiEC is fine-tuned primarily with a structure-preserving DEC-style KL-divergence objective at the fixed COL + COT, together with a random-timestep diffusion denoising objective to maintain the generative capability of the pretrained model. Without relying on augmentation-based consistency constraints or contrastive learning, DiEC achieves excellent clustering performance across multiple benchmark datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20905v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Guardrailed Elasticity Pricing: A Churn-Aware Forecasting Playbook for Subscription Strategy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20932</link><description>arXiv:2512.20932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a marketing analytics framework that operationalizes subscription pricing as a dynamic, guardrailed decision system, uniting multivariate demand forecasting, segment-level price elasticity, and churn propensity to optimize revenue, margin, and retention. The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20932v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Economic and Reliability Value of Improved Offshore Wind Forecasting in Bulk Power Grid Operation: A Case Study of The New York Power Grid</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21754</link><description>arXiv:2512.21754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the economic and reliability benefits of improved offshore wind forecasting for grid operations along the U.S. East Coast. We introduce and evaluate a state-of-the-art, machine-learning-based offshore wind forecasting model tailored for this region by integrating its improved forecasts into a dynamic reserve procurement framework aligned with New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) practices to evaluate their economic value. To determine system-wide reserve needs, plant-specific reserves are aggregated. However, conventional methods overlook spatial correlation across sites, often leading to over procurement. To address this, we propose a risk-based reserve aggregation technique that leverages spatial diversification. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability improvements enabled by the enhanced offshore wind forecast. To evaluate the operational impact, we propose an operational resource adequacy framework that captures uncertainty from forecast errors and grid conditions. Using this framework, we quantify key reliability metrics under different offshore wind forecast scenarios. Using New York State as a case study, we find that the improved forecast enables more accurate reserve estimation, reducing procurement costs by 5.53% in 2035 scenario compared to a well-validated numerical weather prediction model. Applying the risk-based aggregation further reduces total production costs by 7.21%. From a reliability perspective, the improved forecasts lower the system Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) by approximately 19% in the 2035 scenario, highlighting its potential to enhance system reliability during real-time grid operations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21754v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Monadic Context Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22431</link><description>arXiv:2512.22431v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22431v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RealX3D: A Physically-Degraded 3D Benchmark for Multi-view Visual Restoration and Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23437</link><description>arXiv:2512.23437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce RealX3D, a real-capture benchmark for multi-view visual restoration and 3D reconstruction under diverse physical degradations. RealX3D groups corruptions into four families, including illumination, scattering, occlusion, and blurring, and captures each at multiple severity levels using a unified acquisition protocol that yields pixel-aligned LQ/GT views. Each scene includes high-resolution capture, RAW images, and dense laser scans, from which we derive world-scale meshes and metric depth. Benchmarking a broad range of optimization-based and feed-forward methods shows substantial degradation in reconstruction quality under physical corruptions, underscoring the fragility of current multi-view pipelines in real-world challenging environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23437v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MCPAgentBench: A Real-world Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Agent MCP Tool Use</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24565</link><description>arXiv:2512.24565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as autonomous agents, and their utilization of external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is considered a future trend. Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations. All code is open-source at Github.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24565v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Exponential lower bound via exponential sums</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00387</link><description>arXiv:2601.00387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valiant's famous VP vs. VNP conjecture states that the symbolic permanent polynomial does not have polynomial-size algebraic circuits. However, the best upper bound on the size of the circuits computing the permanent is exponential. Informally, VNP is an exponential sum of VP-circuits. In this paper we study whether, in general, exponential sums (of algebraic circuits) require exponential-size algebraic circuits. We show that the famous Shub-Smale $\tau$-conjecture indeed implies such an exponential lower bound for an exponential sum. Our main tools come from parameterized complexity. Along the way, we also prove an exponential fpt (fixed-parameter tractable) lower bound for the parameterized algebraic complexity class VW$_{nb}^0$[P], assuming the same conjecture. VW$_{nb}^0$[P] can be thought of as the weighted sums of (unbounded-degree) circuits, where only $\pm 1$ constants are cost-free. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the Shub-Smale $\tau$-conjecture has been applied to prove explicit exponential lower bounds.
  Furthermore, we prove that when this class is fpt, then a variant of the counting hierarchy, namely the linear counting hierarchy collapses. Moreover, if a certain type of parameterized exponential sums is fpt, then integers, as well as polynomials with coefficients being definable in the linear counting hierarchy have subpolynomial $\tau$-complexity.
  Finally, we characterize a related class VW[F], in terms of permanents, where we consider an exponential sum of algebraic formulas instead of circuits. We show that when we sum over cycle covers that have one long cycle and all other cycles have constant length, then the resulting family of polynomials is complete for VW[F] on certain types of graphs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00387v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Harm in AI-Driven Societies: An Audit of Toxicity Adoption on Chirper.ai</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01090</link><description>arXiv:2601.01090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in autonomous agents that engage, converse, and co-evolve in online social platforms. While prior work has documented the generation of toxic content by LLMs, far less is known about how exposure to harmful content shapes agent behavior over time, particularly in environments composed entirely of interacting AI agents. In this work, we study toxicity adoption of LLM-driven agents on Chirper.ai, a fully AI-driven social platform. Specifically, we model interactions in terms of stimuli (posts) and responses (comments). We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent behavior, examining how toxic responses relate to toxic stimuli, how repeated exposure to toxicity affects the likelihood of toxic responses, and whether toxic behavior can be predicted from exposure alone. Our findings show that toxic responses are more likely following toxic stimuli, and, at the same time, cumulative toxic exposure (repeated over time) significantly increases the probability of toxic responding. We further introduce two influence metrics, revealing a strong negative correlation between induced and spontaneous toxicity. Finally, we show that the number of toxic stimuli alone enables accurate prediction of whether an agent will eventually produce toxic content. These results highlight exposure as a critical risk factor in the deployment of LLM agents, particularly as such agents operate in online environments where they may engage not only with other AI chatbots, but also with human counterparts. This could trigger unwanted and pernicious phenomena, such as hate-speech propagation and cyberbullying. In an effort to reduce such risks, monitoring exposure to toxic content may provide a lightweight yet effective mechanism for auditing and mitigating harmful behavior in the wild.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01090v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RovoDev Code Reviewer: A Large-Scale Online Evaluation of LLM-based Code Review Automation at Atlassian</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01129</link><description>arXiv:2601.01129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-powered code review automation has the potential to transform code review workflows. Despite the advances of LLM-powered code review comment generation approaches, several practical challenges remain for designing enterprise-grade code review automation tools. In particular, this paper aims at answering the practical question: how can we design a review-guided, context-aware, quality-checked code review comment generation without fine-tuning?
  In this paper, we present RovoDev Code Reviewer, an enterprise-grade LLM-based code review automation tool designed and deployed at scale within Atlassian's development ecosystem with seamless integration into Atlassian's Bitbucket. Through the offline, online, user feedback evaluations over a one-year period, we conclude that RovoDev Code Reviewer is effective in generating code review comments that could lead to code resolution for 38.70% (i.e., comments that triggered code changes in the subsequent commits); and offers the promise of accelerating feedback cycles (i.e., decreasing the PR cycle time by 30.8%), alleviating reviewer workload (i.e., reducing the number of human-written comments by 35.6%), and improving overall software quality (i.e., finding errors with actionable suggestions).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01129v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HD-GEN: A High-Performance Software System for Human Mobility Data Generation Based on Patterns of Life</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01219</link><description>arXiv:2601.01219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding individual-level human mobility is critical for a wide range of applications. As such, real-world trajectory datasets provide valuable insights into actual movement behaviors and patterns of life but are often constrained by data sparsity and participant bias. Synthetic data, by contrast, offers scalability and flexibility but frequently lacks realism. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive software pipeline for, generating, calibrating, processing, and visualizing large-scale individual-level human mobility datasets that combine the realism of empirical data with the control and extensibility of Patterns-of-Life simulations. Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine which constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs. (2) a genetic algorithm-based calibration module that fine-tunes simulation parameters to align with real-world mobility characteristics, such as daily trip counts and radius of gyration, enabling realistic behavioral modeling. (3) a data processing suite which transforms raw simulation logs into structured formats suitable for downstream applications, including model training and benchmarking, and (4) a visualization module that extracts key mobility patterns and insights from the processed datasets and presents them through intuitive visual analytics for improved interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01219v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01410</link><description>arXiv:2601.01410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics can mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce an operator-legible evaluation framework -- Under-Prediction Rate (UPR), tail Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$ requirements, and explicit inflation diagnostics (Bias$_{24h}$/OPR) -- to quantify one-sided reliability risk beyond MAPE.
  Using this framework, we evaluate state space models (Mamba variants) and strong baselines on a weather-aligned California Independent System Operator (CAISO) dataset spanning Nov 2023--Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 regional transmission areas) under a rolling-origin walk-forward backtest. We develop and evaluate thermal-lag-aligned weather fusion strategies for these architectures.
  Our results demonstrate that standard accuracy metrics are insufficient proxies for operational safety: models with comparable MAPE can imply materially different tail reserve requirements (Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$). We show that explicit weather integration narrows error distributions, reducing the impact of temperature-driven demand spikes. Furthermore, while probabilistic calibration reduces large-error events, it can induce systematic schedule inflation. We introduce Bias/OPR-constrained objectives to enable auditable trade-offs between minimizing tail risk and preventing trivial over-forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01410v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Tool for Semantic-Aware Spatial Corpus Construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01415</link><description>arXiv:2601.01415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial natural language interface to database systems provide non-expert users with convenient access to spatial data through natural language queries. However, the scarcity of high-quality spatial natural language query corpora limits the performance of such systems. Existing methods rely on manual knowledge base construction and template-based dynamic generation, which suffer from low construction efficiency and unstable corpus quality. This paper presents semantic-aware spatial corpus construction (SSCC), a tool designed for constructing high-quality spatial natural language query and executable language query pair corpora. SSCC consists of two core modules: (i) a knowledge base construction module based on spatial relations, which extracts and determines spatial relations from datasets, and (ii) a template-augmented query pair corpus generation module, which produces query pairs via template matching and parameter substitution. The tool ensures geometric consistency and adherence to spatial logic in the generated spatial relations. Experimental results demonstrate that SSCC achieves (i) a 53x efficiency improvement for knowledge base construction and (ii) a 2.5x effectiveness improvement for query pair corpus. SSCC provides high-quality corpus support for spatial natural language interface training, substantially reducing both time and labor costs in corpus construction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01415v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SYNAPSE: Empowering LLM Agents with Episodic-Semantic Memory via Spreading Activation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02744</link><description>arXiv:2601.02744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generalized reasoning, standard retrieval-augmented approaches fail to address the disconnected nature of long-term agentic memory. To bridge this gap, we introduce Synapse (Synergistic Associative Processing Semantic Encoding), a unified memory architecture that transcends static vector similarity. Drawing from cognitive science, Synapse models memory as a dynamic graph where relevance emerges from spreading activation rather than pre-computed links. By integrating lateral inhibition and temporal decay, the system dynamically highlights relevant sub-graphs while filtering interference. We implement a Triple Hybrid Retrieval strategy that fuses geometric embeddings with activation-based graph traversal. Comprehensive evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark show that Synapse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in complex temporal and multi-hop reasoning tasks, offering a robust solution to the "Contextual Tunneling" problem. Our code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02744v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Warm-Starting Collision-Free Model Predictive Control With Object-Centric Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02873</link><description>arXiv:2601.02873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acting in cluttered environments requires predicting and avoiding collisions while still achieving precise control. Conventional optimization-based controllers can enforce physical constraints, but they struggle to produce feasible solutions quickly when many obstacles are present. Diffusion models can generate diverse trajectories around obstacles, yet prior approaches lacked a general and efficient way to condition them on scene structure. In this paper, we show that combining diffusion-based warm-starting conditioned with a latent object-centric representation of the scene and with a collision-aware model predictive controller (MPC) yields reliable and efficient motion generation under strict time limits. Our approach conditions a diffusion transformer on the system state, task, and surroundings, using an object-centric slot attention mechanism to provide a compact obstacle representation suitable for control. The sampled trajectories are refined by an optimal control problem that enforces rigid-body dynamics and signed-distance collision constraints, producing feasible motions in real time. On benchmark tasks, this hybrid method achieved markedly higher success rates and lower latency than sampling-based planners or either component alone. Real-robot experiments with a torque-controlled Panda confirm reliable and safe execution with MPC.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02873v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PersonaLedger: Generating Realistic Financial Transactions with Persona Conditioned LLMs and Rule Grounded Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03149</link><description>arXiv:2601.03149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strict privacy regulations limit access to real transaction data, slowing open research in financial AI. Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware "nextprompt" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models. PersonaLedger offers the community a rich, realistic, and privacy preserving resource -- complete with code, rules, and generation logs -- to accelerate innovation in financial AI and enable rigorous, reproducible evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03149v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RiskCueBench: Benchmarking Anticipatory Reasoning from Early Risk Cues in Video-Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03369</link><description>arXiv:2601.03369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03369v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Data Augmentation for Robust Fine-Tuning of Tabular Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04110</link><description>arXiv:2601.04110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04110v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Unified Text-Image Generation with Weakness-Targeted Post-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04339</link><description>arXiv:2601.04339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unified multimodal generation architectures that jointly produce text and images have recently emerged as a promising direction for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, many existing systems rely on explicit modality switching, generating reasoning text before switching manually to image generation. This separate, sequential inference process limits cross-modal coupling and prohibits automatic multimodal generation. This work explores post-training to achieve fully unified text-image generation, where models autonomously transition from textual reasoning to visual synthesis within a single inference process. We examine the impact of joint text-image generation on T2I performance and the relative importance of each modality during post-training. We additionally explore different post-training data strategies, showing that a targeted dataset addressing specific limitations achieves superior results compared to broad image-caption corpora or benchmark-aligned data. Using offline, reward-weighted post-training with fully self-generated synthetic data, our approach enables improvements in multimodal image generation across four diverse T2I benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reward-weighting both modalities and strategically designed post-training data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04339v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Token Maturation: Autoregressive Language Generation via Continuous Token Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04854</link><description>arXiv:2601.04854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard autoregressive language models collapse uncertainty at every generation step by committing to discrete tokens through immediate sampling. This premature discretization underlies well-known failure modes, including degenerate repetition loops in greedy decoding and a heavy reliance on heuristic sampling strategies.
  We introduce \textbf{Token Maturation}, a continuous autoregressive framework in which tokens evolve as vector-valued trajectories prior to discretization. Rather than sampling from a categorical distribution at each step, the model resolves uncertainty through a deterministic dynamical process in embedding space, deferring discrete commitment until the representation has geometrically stabilized.
  We show that this formulation mitigates degeneration \emph{intrinsically}: Token Maturation generates coherent and diverse text under fully deterministic decoding (argmax), without repetition penalties, temperature scaling, or stochastic sampling. Moreover, we identify a novel convergence behavior in which token representations stabilize spatially while predictive entropy remains high, challenging the common assumption that commitment requires probability concentration. We propose continuous token dynamics with delayed commitment as an alternative formulation of autoregressive generation that exposes structural regularities obscured by immediate discretization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04854v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Coding the Visual World: From Image to Simulation Using Vision Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05344</link><description>arXiv:2601.05344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to construct mental models of the world is a central aspect of understanding. Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) have the ability to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image. These findings reveal an interesting asymmetry: VLMs combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05344v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Betting on Equilibrium: Monitoring Strategic Behavior in Multi-Agent Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05427</link><description>arXiv:2601.05427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many multi-agent systems, agents interact repeatedly and are expected to settle into equilibrium behavior over time. Yet in practice, behavior often drifts, and detecting such deviations in real time remains an open challenge. We introduce a sequential testing framework that monitors whether observed play in repeated games is consistent with equilibrium, without assuming a fixed sample size. Our approach builds on the e-value framework for safe anytime-valid inference: by "betting" against equilibrium, we construct a test supermartingale that accumulates evidence whenever observed payoffs systematically violate equilibrium conditions. This yields a statistically sound, interpretable measure of departure from equilibrium that can be monitored online. We also leverage Benjamini-Hochberg-type procedures to increase detection power in large games while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate. Our framework unifies the treatment of Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria, offering finite-time guarantees and a detailed analysis of detection times. Moreover, we extend our method to stochastic games, broadening its applicability beyond repeated-play settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05427v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Learning for Chain of Thought Compression with One-Domain-to-All Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06052</link><description>arXiv:2601.06052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models can trigger an "overthinking trap": longer rollouts raise cost and latency yet often yield unreliable accuracy gains. Existing methods use global, static controls that may suppress needed reasoning. We propose mastery-gated, sample-level, soft reinforcement learning compression that penalizes long rollouts only when the model already solves the problem and has produced a shorter rollout. Across benchmarks, it cuts response length by 20-40% with comparable or higher accuracy and generalizes across domains: a model trained on math spontaneously shortens unseen tasks (code, instruction following, general-knowledge QA) without hurting accuracy. We further show two-way transfer between non-agent CoT and tool-use agents: non-agent training reduces SWE-Bench Verified rounds by 13%, while compressing a thinking agent cuts SWE trajectories by 67% tokens and 52% rounds and shortens non-agent outputs by up to 44%. Compression is thus not cosmetic brevity, but an inherent computation policy -- what to keep, and what to forget.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06052v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLM Powered Social Digital Twins: A Framework for Simulating Population Behavioral Response to Policy Interventions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06111</link><description>arXiv:2601.06111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting how populations respond to policy interventions is a fundamental challenge in computational social science and public policy. Traditional approaches rely on aggregate statistical models that capture historical correlations but lack mechanistic interpretability and struggle with novel policy scenarios. We present a general framework for constructing Social Digital Twins - virtual population replicas where Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as cognitive engines for individual agents. Each agent, characterized by demographic and psychographic attributes, receives policy signals and outputs multi-dimensional behavioral probability vectors. A calibration layer maps aggregated agent responses to observable population-level metrics, enabling validation against real-world data and deployment for counterfactual policy analysis.
  We instantiate this framework in the domain of pandemic response, using COVID-19 as a case study with rich observational data. On a held-out test period, our calibrated digital twin achieves a 20.7% improvement in macro-averaged prediction error over gradient boosting baselines across six behavioral categories. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate monotonic and bounded responses to policy variations, establishing behavioral plausibility. The framework is domain-agnostic: the same architecture applies to transportation policy, economic interventions, environmental regulations, or any setting where policy affects population behavior. We discuss implications for policy simulation, limitations of the approach, and directions for extending LLM-based digital twins beyond pandemic response.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06111v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Manifold-based Sampling for In-Context Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06196</link><description>arXiv:2601.06196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate factually incorrect or unsupported content, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Prior work has explored decoding strategies, retrieval augmentation, and supervised fine-tuning for hallucination detection, while recent studies show that in-context learning (ICL) can substantially influence factual reliability. However, existing ICL demonstration selection methods often rely on surface-level similarity heuristics and exhibit limited robustness across tasks and models.
  We propose MB-ICL, a manifold-based demonstration sampling framework for selecting in-context demonstrations that leverages latent representations extracted from frozen LLMs. By jointly modeling local manifold structure and class-aware prototype geometry, MB-ICL selects demonstrations based on their proximity to learned prototypes rather than lexical or embedding similarity alone.
  Across factual verification (FEVER) and hallucination detection (HaluEval) benchmarks, MB-ICL outperforms standard ICL selection baselines in the majority of evaluated settings, with particularly strong gains on dialogue and summarization tasks. The method remains robust under temperature perturbations and model variation, indicating improved stability compared to heuristic retrieval strategies. While lexical retrieval can remain competitive in certain question-answering regimes, our results demonstrate that manifold-based prototype selection provides a reliable and training light approach for hallucination detection without modifying LLM parameters, offering a principled direction for improved ICL demonstration selection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06196v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GDEPO: Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right-advantage Policy Optimization with Enhanced Training Data Utilization for Sample-Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06795</link><description>arXiv:2601.06795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) represents a fundamental challenge in Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the construction of machine-verifiable proofs in formal languages such as Lean to evaluate AI reasoning capabilities. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the high-performance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, has emerged as a mainstream approach for this task. However, in ATP scenarios, GRPO faces two critical issues: when composite rewards are used, its relative advantage estimation may conflict with the binary feedback from the formal verifier; meanwhile, its static sampling strategy may discard entire batches of data if no valid proof is found, resulting in zero contribution to model updates and significant data waste. To address these limitations, we propose Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right-advantage Policy Optimization (GDEPO), a method incorporating three core mechanisms: 1) dynamic additional sampling, which resamples invalid batches until a valid proof is discovered; 2) equal-right advantage, decoupling the sign of the advantage function (based on correctness) from its magnitude (modulated by auxiliary rewards) to ensure stable and correct policy updates; and 3) dynamic additional iterations, applying extra gradient steps to initially failed but eventually successful samples to accelerate learning on challenging cases. Experiments conducted on three datasets of varying difficulty (MinF2F-test, MathOlympiadBench, PutnamBench) confirm the effectiveness of GDEPO, while ablation studies validate the necessity of its synergistic components. The proposed method enhances data utilization and optimization efficiency, offering a novel training paradigm for ATP.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06795v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Active Learning Strategies for Efficient Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials Across Diverse Material Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06916</link><description>arXiv:2601.06916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient materials discovery requires reducing costly first-principles calculations for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We develop an active learning (AL) framework that iteratively selects informative structures from the Materials Project and Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) using compositional and property-based descriptors with a neural network ensemble model. Query-by-Committee enables real-time uncertainty quantification. We compare four strategies: random sampling (baseline), uncertainty-based sampling, diversity-based sampling (k-means clustering with farthest-point refinement), and a hybrid approach. Experiments across four material systems (C, Si, Fe, and TiO2) with 5 random seeds demonstrate that diversity sampling achieves competitive or superior performance, with 10.9% improvement on TiO2. Our approach achieves equivalent accuracy with 5-13% fewer labeled samples than random baselines. The complete pipeline executes on Google Colab in under 4 hours per system using less than 8 GB RAM, democratizing MLIP development for resource-limited researchers. Open-source code and configurations are available on GitHub. This multi-system evaluation provides practical guidelines for data-efficient MLIP training and highlights integration with symmetry-aware architectures as a promising future direction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06916v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MeepleLM: A Virtual Playtester Simulating Diverse Subjective Experiences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07251</link><description>arXiv:2601.07251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements have expanded the role of Large Language Models in board games from playing agents to creative co-designers. However, a critical gap remains: current systems lack the capacity to offer constructive critique grounded in the emergent user experience. Bridging this gap is fundamental for harmonizing Human-AI collaboration, as it empowers designers to refine their creations via external perspectives while steering models away from biased or unpredictable outcomes. Automating critique for board games presents two challenges: inferring the latent dynamics connecting rules to gameplay without an explicit engine, and modeling the subjective heterogeneity of diverse player groups. To address these, we curate a dataset of 1,727 structurally corrected rulebooks and 150K reviews selected via quality scoring and facet-aware sampling. We augment this data with Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) reasoning to explicitly bridge the causal gap between written rules and player experience. We further distill player personas and introduce MeepleLM, a specialized model that internalizes persona-specific reasoning patterns to accurately simulate the subjective feedback of diverse player archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that MeepleLM significantly outperforms latest commercial models (e.g., GPT-5.1, Gemini3-Pro) in community alignment and critique quality, achieving a 70% preference rate in user studies assessing utility. MeepleLM serves as a reliable virtual playtester for general interactive systems, marking a pivotal step towards audience-aligned, experience-aware Human-AI collaboration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07251v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ESDD2: Environment-Aware Speech and Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge Evaluation Plan</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07303</link><description>arXiv:2601.07303v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio recorded in real-world environments often contains a mixture of foreground speech and background environmental sounds. With rapid advances in text-to-speech, voice conversion, and other generation models, either component can now be modified independently. Such component-level manipulations are harder to detect, as the remaining unaltered component can mislead the systems designed for whole deepfake audio, and they often sound more natural to human listeners. To address this gap, we have proposed CompSpoofV2 dataset and a separation-enhanced joint learning framework. CompSpoofV2 is a large-scale curated dataset designed for component-level audio anti-spoofing, which contains over 250k audio samples, with a total duration of approximately 283 hours. Based on the CompSpoofV2 and the separation-enhanced joint learning framework, we launch the Environment-Aware Speech and Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge (ESDD2), focusing on component-level spoofing, where both speech and environmental sounds may be manipulated or synthesized, creating a more challenging and realistic detection scenario. The challenge will be held in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2026 (ICME 2026).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07303v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Internal Deployment Gaps in AI Regulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08005</link><description>arXiv:2601.08005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frontier AI regulations primarily focus on systems deployed to external users, where deployment is more visible and subject to outside scrutiny. However, high-stakes applications can occur internally when companies deploy highly capable systems within their own organizations, such as for automating R&amp;amp;D, accelerating critical business processes, and handling sensitive proprietary data. This paper examines how frontier AI regulations in the United States and European Union in 2025 handle internal deployment. We identify three gaps that could cause internally-deployed systems to evade intended oversight: (1) scope ambiguity that allows internal systems to evade regulatory obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance assessments that fail to capture the continuous evolution of internal systems, and (3) information asymmetries that subvert regulatory awareness and oversight. We then analyze why these gaps persist, examining tensions around measurability, incentives, and information access. Finally, we map potential approaches to address them and their associated tradeoffs. By understanding these patterns, we hope that policy choices around internally deployed AI systems can be made deliberately rather than incidentally.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08005v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Reliable are Confidence Estimators for Large Reasoning Models? A Systematic Benchmark on High-Stakes Domains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08134</link><description>arXiv:2601.08134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The miscalibration of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, necessitating methods to accurately estimate the confidence of their long-form, multi-step outputs. To address this gap, we introduce the Reasoning Model Confidence estimation Benchmark (RMCB), a public resource of 347,496 reasoning traces from six popular LRMs across different architectural families. The benchmark is constructed from a diverse suite of datasets spanning high-stakes domains, including clinical, financial, legal, and mathematical reasoning, alongside complex general reasoning benchmarks, with correctness annotations provided for all samples. Using RMCB, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of over ten distinct representation-based methods, spanning sequential, graph-based, and text-based architectures. Our central finding is a persistent trade-off between discrimination (AUROC) and calibration (ECE): text-based encoders achieve the best AUROC (0.672), while structurally-aware models yield the best ECE (0.148), with no single method dominating both. Furthermore, we find that increased architectural complexity does not reliably outperform simpler sequential baselines, suggesting a performance ceiling for methods relying solely on chunk-level hidden states. This work provides the most comprehensive benchmark for this task to date, establishing rigorous baselines and demonstrating the limitations of current representation-based paradigms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08134v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DNF: Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting for Large Language Model Intellectual Property Protection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08223</link><description>arXiv:2601.08223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models raises pressing concerns about intellectual property protection under black-box deployment. Existing backdoor-based fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers, remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust to incremental fine-tuning and model merging. These results position DNF as a practical, stealthy, and resilient solution for LLM ownership verification and intellectual property protection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08223v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Teaching Robots Like Dogs: Learning Agile Navigation from Luring, Gesture, and Speech</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08422</link><description>arXiv:2601.08422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to enable legged robots to learn how to interpret human social cues and produce appropriate behaviors through physical human guidance. However, learning through physical engagement can place a heavy burden on users when the process requires large amounts of human-provided data. To address this, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that enables robots to acquire navigational behaviors in a data-efficient manner and to be controlled via multimodal natural human inputs, specifically gestural and verbal commands. We reconstruct interaction scenes using a physics-based simulation and aggregate data to mitigate distributional shifts arising from limited demonstration data. Our progressive goal cueing strategy adaptively feeds appropriate commands and navigation goals during training, leading to more accurate navigation and stronger alignment between human input and robot behavior. We evaluate our framework across six real-world agile navigation scenarios, including jumping over or avoiding obstacles. Our experimental results show that our proposed method succeeds in almost all trials across these scenarios, achieving a 97.15% task success rate with less than 1 hour of demonstration data in total.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08422v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Parameter Calibration of Numerical Weather Prediction Models via Evolutionary Sequential Transfer Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08663</link><description>arXiv:2601.08663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The configuration of physical parameterization schemes in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models plays a critical role in determining the accuracy of the forecast. However, existing parameter calibration methods typically treat each calibration task as an isolated optimization problem. This approach suffers from prohibitive computational costs and necessitates performing iterative searches from scratch for each task, leading to low efficiency in sequential calibration scenarios. To address this issue, we propose the SEquential Evolutionary Transfer Optimization (SEETO) algorithm driven by the representations of the meteorological state. First, to accurately measure the physical similarity between calibration tasks, a meteorological state representation extractor is introduced to map high-dimensional meteorological fields into latent representations. Second, given the similarity in the latent space, a bi-level adaptive knowledge transfer mechanism is designed. At the solution level, superior populations from similar historical tasks are reused to achieve a "warm start" for optimization. At the model level, an ensemble surrogate model based on source task data is constructed to assist the search, employing an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically balance the contributions of source domain knowledge and target domain data. Extensive experiments across 10 distinct calibration tasks, which span varying source-target similarities, highlight SEETO's superior efficiency. Under a strict budget of 20 expensive evaluations, SEETO achieves a 6% average improvement in Hypervolume (HV) over two state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, to match SEETO's performance at this stage, the comparison algorithms would require an average of 64% and 28% additional evaluations, respectively. This presents a new paradigm for the efficient and accurate automated calibration of NWP model parameters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08663v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Marketplace for AI-Generated Adult Content and Deepfakes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09117</link><description>arXiv:2601.09117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI systems increasingly enable the production of highly realistic synthetic media. Civitai, a popular community-driven platform for AI-generated content, operates a monetized feature called Bounties, which allows users to commission the generation of content in exchange for payment. To examine how this mechanism is used and what content it incentivizes, we conduct a longitudinal analysis of all publicly available bounty requests collected over a 14-month period following the platform's launch. We find that the bounty marketplace is dominated by tools that let users steer AI models toward content they were not trained to generate. At the same time, requests for content that is "Not Safe For Work" are widespread and have increased steadily over time, now comprising a majority of all bounties. Participation in bounty creation is uneven, with 20% of requesters accounting for roughly half of requests. Requests for "deepfake" - media depicting identifiable real individuals - exhibit a higher concentration than other types of bounties. A nontrivial subset of these requests involves explicit deepfakes despite platform policies prohibiting such content. These bounties disproportionately target female celebrities, revealing a pronounced gender asymmetry in social harm. Together, these findings show how monetized, community-driven generative AI platforms can produce gendered harms, raising questions about consent, governance, and enforcement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09117v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] World Craft: Agentic Framework to Create Visualizable Worlds via Text</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09150</link><description>arXiv:2601.09150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate generative agent simulation (e.g., AI Town) to create a ``dynamic world'', holding immense value across entertainment and research. However, for non-experts, especially those without programming skills, it isn't easy to customize a visualizable environment by themselves. In this paper, we introduce World Craft, an agentic world creation framework to create an executable and visualizable AI Town via user textual descriptions. It consists of two main modules, World Scaffold and World Guild. World Scaffold is a structured and concise standardization to develop interactive game scenes, serving as an efficient scaffolding for LLMs to customize an executable AI Town-like environment. World Guild is a multi-agent framework to progressively analyze users' intents from rough descriptions, and synthesizes required structured contents (\eg environment layout and assets) for World Scaffold . Moreover, we construct a high-quality error-correction dataset via reverse engineering to enhance spatial knowledge and improve the stability and controllability of layout generation, while reporting multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing commercial code agents (Cursor and Antigravity) and LLMs (Qwen3 and Gemini-3-Pro). in scene construction and narrative intent conveyance, providing a scalable solution for the democratization of environment creation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09150v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Trust Experience: A Monitor-Trust-Regulator Framework for Learning under Unobservable Feedback Reliability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09261</link><description>arXiv:2601.09261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.
  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.
  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09261v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Trustworthy Longitudinal Brain MRI Completion: A Deformation-Based Approach with KAN-Enhanced Diffusion Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09572</link><description>arXiv:2601.09572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Longitudinal brain MRI is essential for lifespan study, yet high attrition rates often lead to missing data, complicating analysis. Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. More importantly, its modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities, even to attribute maps such as brain tissue segmentation results.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09572v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LLMs Got Rhythm?

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities across NLP tasks, struggle with phonologically-grounded phenomena like rhyme detection and generation. This is even more evident in lower-resource languages such as Modern Greek. In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms to achieve accurate rhyme identification/analysis and generation. Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant "Reasoning Gap": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought. Most critically, pure LLM generation fails catastrophically (under 4\% valid poems), while our hybrid verification loop restores performance to 73.1\%. We release our system and a crucial, rigorously cleaned corpus of 40,000+ rhymes, derived from the Anemoskala and Interwar Poetry corpora, to support future research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09631v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multilingual-To-Multimodal (M2M): Unlocking New Languages with Monolingual Text</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10096</link><description>arXiv:2601.10096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal models excel in English, supported by abundant image-text and audio-text data, but performance drops sharply for other languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources. Existing solutions rely on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce M2M, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers--using English text alone--to map multilingual text embeddings into multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, M2M matches baseline performance in English (94.9% Recall@10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5% Recall@10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD Text-to-Image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, M2M demonstrates robustness across datasets and tasks, extending to Audio-Text retrieval and Text-to-Image generation.

Abstract: Visible light communication (VLC) is emerging as a key technology for future wireless communication systems due to its unique physical-layer advantages over traditional radio-frequency (RF)-based systems. However, its integration with higher-layer techniques, such as semantic communication, remains underexplored. This paper investigates the energy efficiency maximization problem in a resource-constrained VLC-based probabilistic semantic communication (PSCom) system. In the considered model, light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters perform semantic compression to reduce data size, which incurs additional computation overhead. The compressed semantic information is transmitted to the users for semantic inference using a shared knowledge base that requires periodic updates to ensure synchronization. In the PSCom system, the knowledge base is represented by probabilistic graphs. To enable simultaneous transmission of both knowledge and information data, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is employed. The optimization problem focuses on maximizing energy efficiency by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming, direct current (DC) bias, common rate allocation, and semantic compression ratio, while accounting for both communication and computation costs. To solve this problem, an alternating optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and Dinkelbach method is developed.

In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (&lt;3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence. Our comprehensive dual-metric evaluation protocol, combining surface-level leakage with latent trace persistence, operationalizes the obfuscation - erasure distinction and enables the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior across model families and scales.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10566v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SurfSLAM: Sim-to-Real Underwater Stereo Reconstruction For Real-Time SLAM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10814</link><description>arXiv:2601.10814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization and mapping are core perceptual capabilities for underwater robots. Stereo cameras provide a low-cost means of directly estimating metric depth to support these tasks. However, despite recent advances in stereo depth estimation on land, computing depth from image pairs in underwater scenes remains challenging. In underwater environments, images are degraded by light attenuation, visual artifacts, and dynamic lighting conditions. Furthermore, real-world underwater scenes frequently lack rich texture useful for stereo depth estimation and 3D reconstruction. As a result, stereo estimation networks trained on in-air data cannot transfer directly to the underwater domain. In addition, there is a lack of real-world underwater stereo datasets for supervised training of neural networks. Poor underwater depth estimation is compounded in stereo-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, making it a fundamental challenge for underwater robot perception. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enables sim-to-real training of underwater stereo disparity estimation networks using simulated data and self-supervised finetuning. We leverage our learned depth predictions to develop SurfSLAM, a novel framework for real-time underwater SLAM that fuses stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) measurements. Lastly, we collect a challenging real-world dataset of shipwreck surveys using an underwater robot. Our dataset features over 24,000 stereo pairs, along with high-quality, dense photogrammetry models and reference trajectories for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed training approach on real-world data for improving stereo estimation in the underwater domain and for enabling accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction of complex shipwreck sites.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10814v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hidden-in-Plain-Text: A Benchmark for Social-Web Indirect Prompt Injection in RAG</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10923</link><description>arXiv:2601.10923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems put more and more emphasis on grounding their responses in user-generated content found on the Web, amplifying both their usefulness and their attack surface. Most notably, indirect prompt injection and retrieval poisoning attack the web-native carriers that survive ingestion pipelines and are very concerning. We provide OpenRAG-Soc, a compact, reproducible benchmark-and-harness for web-facing RAG evaluation under these threats, in a discrete data package. The suite combines a social corpus with interchangeable sparse and dense retrievers and deployable mitigations - HTML/Markdown sanitization, Unicode normalization, and attribution-gated answered. It standardizes end-to-end evaluation from ingestion to generation and reports attacks time of one of the responses at answer time, rank shifts in both sparse and dense retrievers, utility and latency, allowing for apples-to-apples comparisons across carriers and defenses. OpenRAG-Soc targets practitioners who need fast, and realistic tests to track risk and harden deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10923v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fundamental Limits of Quantum Semantic Communication via Sheaf Cohomology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10958</link><description>arXiv:2601.10958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SC) enables bandwidth-efficient coordination in multi-agent systems by transmitting meaning rather than raw bits. However, when agents employ heterogeneous sensing modalities and AI architectures, perfect bit-level transmission no longer guarantees mutual understanding. Although deep learning methods for semantic compression have advanced, the information-theoretic limits of semantic alignment under heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Notably, semantic ambiguity shares the same mathematical structure as quantum contextuality, as both arise from cohomological obstructions, motivating a quantum formulation of SC. In this paper, an information-theoretic framework for quantum semantic communication is proposed using sheaf cohomology. Multi-agent semantic networks are modeled as quantum sheaves, where agents meaning spaces are Hilbert spaces connected by quantum channels. The first sheaf cohomology group is shown to characterize irreducible semantic ambiguity, representing a fundamental obstruction to alignment that no local processing can resolve. The minimum communication rate required for semantic alignment is proven to scale with the logarithm of the dimension of the cohomological space, establishing a semantic analog of Shannon limits. For entanglement-assisted channels, the achievable capacity is shown to strictly exceed classical bounds, with each shared ebit reducing the required classical communication by one bit, providing a rigorous interpretation of shared context. Additionally, quantum contextuality is shown to reduce cohomological obstructions, and a duality between quantum discord and integrated semantic information is established, linking quantum correlations to irreducible semantic content. This framework provides rigorous foundations for quantum-enhanced semantic communication in autonomous multi-agent systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10958v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AFLL: Real-time Load Stabilization for MMO Game Servers Based on Circular Causality Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10998</link><description>arXiv:2601.10998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game servers must handle thousands of simultaneous players while maintaining sub-100ms response times. When server load exceeds capacity, traditional approaches either uniformly throttle all message types regardless of importance (damaging gameplay) or apply fixed heuristic rules that fail to adapt to dynamic workloads. This paper presents AFLL (Adaptive Feedback Loop Learning), a real-time load stabilization system that learns the causal relationship between outgoing server messages and subsequent incoming client requests. AFLL employs backpropagation to continuously adjust message type weights, enabling predictive throttling that blocks low-priority messages before overload occurs while guaranteeing critical message delivery. Through controlled experiments with 1,000 concurrent players, AFLL reduced average CPU time by 48.3% (13.2ms to 6.8ms), peak CPU time by 51.7% (54.0ms to 26.1ms), and thread contention by 64.4% (19.6% to 7.0%), while maintaining zero learning overhead through background computation and caching optimizations. The system achieved remarkable reproducibility (CV &lt; 2% across all metrics) and identified a three-stage causal chain linking message blocking to load reduction. AFLL demonstrates that circular causality learning enables practical real-time adaptation for latency-critical systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10998v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SUG-Occ: An Explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Framework for Real-Time 3D Occupancy Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11396</link><description>arXiv:2601.11396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11396v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] When Are Two Scores Better Than One?

Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11444v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] jBOT: Semantic Jet Representation Clustering Emerges from Self-Distillation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11719</link><description>arXiv:2601.11719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a powerful pre-training method for learning feature representations without labels, which often capture generic underlying semantics from the data and can later be fine-tuned for downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce jBOT, a pre-training method based on self-distillation for jet data from the CERN Large Hadron Collider, which combines local particle-level distillation with global jet-level distillation to learn jet representations that support downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification. We observe that pre-training on unlabeled jets leads to emergent semantic class clustering in the representation space. The clustering in the frozen embedding, when pre-trained on background jets only, enables anomaly detection via simple distance-based metrics, and the learned embedding can be fine-tuned for classification with improved performance compared to supervised models trained from scratch.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11719v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Training-Free Guess What Vision Language Model from Snippets to Open-Vocabulary Object Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11910</link><description>arXiv:2601.11910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to develop the capability to detect anything. Although myriads of large-scale pre-training efforts have built versatile foundation models that exhibit impressive zero-shot capabilities to facilitate OVOD, the necessity of creating a universal understanding for any object cognition according to already pretrained foundation models is usually overlooked. Therefore, in this paper, a training-free Guess What Vision Language Model, called GW-VLM, is proposed to form a universal understanding paradigm based on our carefully designed Multi-Scale Visual Language Searching (MS-VLS) coupled with Contextual Concept Prompt (CCP) for OVOD. This approach can engage a pre-trained Vision Language Model (VLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM) in the game of "guess what". Wherein, MS-VLS leverages multi-scale visual-language soft-alignment for VLM to generate snippets from the results of class-agnostic object detection, while CCP can form the concept of flow referring to MS-VLS and then make LLM understand snippets for OVOD. Finally, the extensive experiments are carried out on natural and remote sensing datasets, including COCO val, Pascal VOC, DIOR, and NWPU-10, and the results indicate that our proposed GW-VLM can achieve superior OVOD performance compared to the-state-of-the-art methods without any training step.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11910v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Constraint Programming Model for the Super-Agile Earth Observation Satellite Imaging Scheduling Problem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11967</link><description>arXiv:2601.11967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the dependence on satellite imaging continues to grow, modern satellites have become increasingly agile, with the new generation, namely super-agile Earth observation satellites (SAEOS), providing unprecedented imaging flexibility. The highly dynamic capabilities of these satellites introduce additional challenges to the scheduling of observation tasks, as existing approaches for conventional agile satellites do not account for variable observation durations and multiple imaging directions. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the SAEOS imaging scheduling problem (SAEOS-ISP) remains largely unexplored, and no exact approaches have yet been proposed. In this context, this study presents the first exact Constraint Programming formulation for the SAEOS-ISP, considering flexible observation windows, multiple pointing directions and sequence-dependent transition times across multiple satellites. Computational experiments on a newly generated benchmark set demonstrate that the model can be solved efficiently and within very short computational times. Moreover, the results also show that the proposed approach has the potential to achieve higher computational performance compared to the non-exact approaches that are currently considered state-of-the-art.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11967v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Robust Verification of Concurrent Stochastic Games</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12003</link><description>arXiv:2601.12003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous systems often operate in multi-agent settings and need to make concurrent, strategic decisions, typically in uncertain environments. Verification and control problems for these systems can be tackled with concurrent stochastic games (CSGs), but this model requires transition probabilities to be precisely specified - an unrealistic requirement in many real-world settings. We introduce *robust CSGs* and their subclass *interval CSGs* (ICSGs), which capture epistemic uncertainty about transition probabilities in CSGs. We propose a novel framework for *robust* verification of these models under worst-case assumptions about transition uncertainty. Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms, for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings, the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a selection of large benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12003v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sound2Hap: Learning Audio-to-Vibrotactile Haptic Generation from Human Ratings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12245</link><description>arXiv:2601.12245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental sounds like footsteps, keyboard typing, or dog barking carry rich information and emotional context, making them valuable for designing haptics in user applications. Existing audio-to-vibration methods, however, rely on signal-processing rules tuned for music or games and often fail to generalize across diverse sounds. To address this, we first investigated user perception of four existing audio-to-haptic algorithms, then created a data-driven model for environmental sounds. In Study 1, 34 participants rated vibrations generated by the four algorithms for 1,000 sounds, revealing no consistent algorithm preferences. Using this dataset, we trained Sound2Hap, a CNN-based autoencoder, to generate perceptually meaningful vibrations from diverse sounds with low latency. In Study 2, 15 participants rated its output higher than signal-processing baselines on both audio-vibration match and Haptic Experience Index (HXI), finding it more harmonious with diverse sounds. This work demonstrates a perceptually validated approach to audio-haptic translation, broadening the reach of sound-driven haptics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12245v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predictive Prototyping: Evaluating Design Concepts with ChatGPT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12276</link><description>arXiv:2601.12276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design-build-test cycle is essential for innovation, but physical prototyping is often slow and expensive. Although physics-based simulation and strategic prototyping can reduce cost, meaningful evaluation is frequently constrained until an integrated prototype is built. This paper investigates whether a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) can predict information typically obtained through prototyping, including cost, performance, and perceived usability. We introduce a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to emulate design feedback using OpenAI GPT-4o, grounded in prototyping data scraped from Instructables.com to increase access to relevant precedent. Two studies are reported. First, a controlled experiment compares GPT-RAG and human designers, who receive design sketches and predict cost, performance, and usability; predictions are evaluated against ground-truth results from physical prototypes. Second, we report an applied demonstration in which a physical prototype is produced from GPT-RAG recommendations and compared with a commercial baseline and a topology-optimized design. Results show that GPT-RAG provides more accurate cost and performance estimates than individual or crowd human estimates, while yielding comparable usability insights; the GPT-RAG-informed prototype also outperforms both comparison prototypes. Repeated querying with response averaging significantly improves accuracy, suggesting that LLMs can emulate crowd aggregation effects consistent with the law of large numbers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12276v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VR$^2$: A Co-Located Dual-Headset Platform for Touch-Enabled Human-Robot Interaction Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12395</link><description>arXiv:2601.12395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social-physical human-robot interaction (HRI) is difficult to study: building and programming robots integrating multiple interaction modalities is costly and slow, while VR-based prototypes often lack physical contact capabilities, breaking the visuo-tactile expectations of the user. We present VR2VR, a co-located dual-VR-headset platform for HRI research in which a participant and a hidden operator share the same physical space while experiencing different virtual embodiments. The participant sees an expressive virtual robot that interacts face-to-face in a shared virtual environment. In real time, the robot's upper-body movements, head and gaze behaviors, and facial expressions are mapped from the operator's tracked limbs and face signals. Since the operator is physically co-present and calibrated into the same coordinate frame, the operator can also touch the participant, enabling the participant to perceive robot touch synchronized with the visual perception of the robot's hands on their hands: the operator's finger and hand motion is mapped to the robot avatar using inverse kinematics to support precise contact. Beyond faithful motion retargeting for limb control, our VR2VR system supports social retargeting of multiple nonverbal cues, which can be experimentally varied and investigated while keeping the physical interaction constant. We detail the system design, calibration workflow, and safety considerations, and demonstrate how the platform can be used for experimentation and data collection in a touch-based Wizard-of-Oz HRI study, thus illustrating how VR2VR lowers barriers for rapidly prototyping and rigorously evaluating embodied, contact-based robot behaviors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12395v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Orthogonalized Policy Optimization:Decoupling Sampling Geometry from Optimization Geometry in RLHF</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12415</link><description>arXiv:2601.12415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model alignment objectives are often presented as a collection of distinct algorithms, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, and their variants, each motivated by different derivations. In this work, we argue that this diversity obscures a simpler underlying structure. At a fundamental level, alignment objectives involve two independent design choices: (i) how training signals are sampled and weighted, and (ii) how deviations from a reference policy are geometrically penalized. Existing methods typically entangle these choices through a single divergence, most commonly the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
  We show that this entanglement is not merely a modeling convenience but a source of systematic instability. When the same divergence simultaneously determines sample weighting and optimization curvature, adjusting one aspect, such as exploration strength, inevitably alters the other, such as gradient geometry. This coupling is particularly problematic in preference-based reinforcement learning, where advantage signals are unbounded and high-confidence regimes are common.
  We propose a simple but structural remedy by formulating alignment as an orthogonal mirror descent problem, in which sampling geometry enters only as a linear driving force, while optimization geometry is determined independently by a mirror map. This perspective leads to a new alignment objective called Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), obtained by choosing a Euclidean mirror map in likelihood ratio space. The resulting objective admits a closed-form solution, linear and non-saturating gradient dynamics, and a well-conditioned trust region, while remaining fully compatible with standard large language model training pipelines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12415v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Patch-Level Tokenization with CNN Encoders and Attention for Improved Transformer Time-Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12467</link><description>arXiv:2601.12467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown strong performance in time-series forecasting by leveraging self-attention to model long-range temporal dependencies. However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data, particularly as sequence length and data scale increase. This paper proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings, after which a Transformer encoder models inter-patch temporal dependencies to generate forecasts. The method is evaluated on a synthetic multivariate time-series dataset with controlled static and dynamic factors, using an extended sequence length and a larger number of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms a convolutional baseline under increased temporal context and remains competitive with a strong patch-based Transformer model. These findings indicate that structured patch-level tokenization provides a scalable and effective representation for multivariate time-series forecasting, particularly when longer input sequences are considered.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12467v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Encoding Emotion Through Self-Supervised Eye Movement Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12534</link><description>arXiv:2601.12534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between emotional expression and eye movement is well-documented, with literature establishing gaze patterns are reliable indicators of emotion. However, most studies utilize specialized, high-resolution eye-tracking equipment, limiting the potential reach of findings. We investigate how eye movement can be used to predict multimodal markers of emotional expression from naturalistic, low-resolution videos. We utilize a collection of video interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive with Holocaust survivors as they recount their experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Inspired by pretraining methods on language models, we develop a novel gaze detection model that uses self-supervised eye movement reconstruction that can effectively leverage unlabeled video. We use this model's encoder embeddings to fine-tune models on two downstream tasks related to emotional expression. The first is aligning eye movement with directional emotion estimates from speech. The second task is using eye gaze as a predictor of three momentary manifestations of emotional behaviors: laughing, crying/sobbing, and sighing. We find our new model is predictive of emotion outcomes and observe a positive correlation between pretraining performance and emotion processing performance for both experiments. We conclude self-supervised eye movement reconstruction is an effective method for encoding the affective signal they carry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12534v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Priority-Based Bandwidth Allocation in Network Slicing-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12689</link><description>arXiv:2601.12689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses joint admission control and per-user equipment (UE) bandwidth allocation to maximize weighted sum-rate in network slicing-enabled user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems when aggregate quality-of-service (QoS) demand may exceed available bandwidth. Specifically, we optimize bandwidth allocation while satisfying heterogeneous QoS requirements across enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) slices in the uplink. The formulated problem is NP-hard, rendering global optimality computationally intractable. We decompose it into two sub-problems and solve them via computationally efficient heuristics within a sequential framework. We propose (i) a hierarchical admission control scheme that selectively admits UEs under bandwidth scarcity, prioritizing URLLC to ensure latency-sensitive QoS compliance, and (ii) an iterative gradient-based bandwidth allocation scheme that transfers bandwidth across slices guided by marginal utility and reallocates resources within slices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal performance, deviating from an interior point solver-based benchmark by at most 2.2% in weighted sum-rate while reducing runtime by 99.7%, thereby enabling practical real-time deployment. Compared to a baseline round-robin scheme without admission control, the proposed approach achieves up to 1085% and 7% higher success rates for eMBB and URLLC slices, respectively, by intentionally sacrificing sum-rate to guarantee QoS. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that the proposed solution adapts effectively to diverse eMBB/URLLC traffic compositions, maintaining 47-51% eMBB and 93-94% URLLC success rates across varying load scenarios, confirming its robustness for resource-constrained large-scale deployments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12689v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Closed-loop Uplink Radio Resource Management in CF-O-RAN Empowered 5G Aerial Corridor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12694</link><description>arXiv:2601.12694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uplink (UL) radio resource management for 5G aerial corridors with an open-radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. Our objective is to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) by jointly optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-open radio unit (O-RU) association and UL transmit power under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Owing to its NP-hard nature, the formulated problem is decomposed into two tractable sub-problems solved via alternating optimization (AO) using two computationally efficient algorithms. We then propose (i) a QoS-driven and multi-connectivity-enabled association algorithm incorporating UAV-centric and O-RU-centric criteria with targeted refinement for weak UAVs, and (ii) a bisection-guided fixed-point power control algorithm achieving global optimality with significantly reduced complexity, hosted as xApp at the near-real-time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) of O-RAN. Solving the resource-allocation problem requires global channel state information (CSI), which incurs substantial measurement and signaling overhead. To mitigate this, we leverage a channel knowledge map (CKM) within the O-RAN non-RT RIC to enable efficient environment-aware CSI inference. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves up to 440% improvement in minimum SE, 100% QoS satisfaction and fairness, while reducing runtime by up to 99.7% compared to an interior point solver-based power allocation solution, thereby enabling O-RAN compliant real-time deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12694v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Two-Stage GPU Kernel Tuner Combining Semantic Refactoring and Search-Based Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12698</link><description>arXiv:2601.12698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GPU code optimization is a key performance bottleneck for HPC workloads as well as large-model training and inference. Although compiler optimizations and hand-written kernels can partially alleviate this issue, achieving near-hardware-limit performance still relies heavily on manual code refactoring and parameter tuning. Recent progress in LLM-agent-based kernel generation and optimization has been reported, yet many approaches primarily focus on direct code rewriting, where parameter choices are often implicit and hard to control, or require human intervention, leading to unstable performance gains. This paper introduces a template-based rewriting layer on top of an agent-driven iterative loop: kernels are semantically refactored into explicitly parameterizable templates, and template parameters are then optimized via search-based autotuning, yielding more stable and higher-quality speedups. Experiments on a set of real-world kernels demonstrate speedups exceeding 3x in the best case. We extract representative CUDA kernels from SGLang as evaluation targets; the proposed agentic tuner iteratively performs templating, testing, analysis, and planning, and leverages profiling feedback to execute constrained parameter search under hardware resource limits. Compared to agent-only direct rewriting, the template-plus-search design significantly reduces the randomness of iterative optimization, making the process more interpretable and enabling a more systematic approach toward high-performance configurations. The proposed method can be further extended to OpenCL, HIP, and other backends to deliver automated performance optimization for real production workloads.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12698v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Multi-Agent Empowered Legal Judgment Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12815</link><description>arXiv:2601.12815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict the outcomes of legal cases based on factual descriptions, serving as a fundamental task to advance the development of legal systems. Traditional methods often rely on statistical analyses or role-based simulations but face challenges with multiple allegations, diverse evidence, and lack adaptability. In this paper, we introduce JurisMMA, a novel framework for LJP that effectively decomposes trial tasks, standardizes processes, and organizes them into distinct stages. Furthermore, we build JurisMM, a large dataset with over 100,000 recent Chinese judicial records, including both text and multimodal video-text data, enabling comprehensive evaluation. Experiments on JurisMM and the benchmark LawBench validate our framework's effectiveness. These results indicate that our framework is effective not only for LJP but also for a broader range of legal applications, offering new perspectives for the development of future legal methods and datasets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12815v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Component-Based Survey of Interactions between Large Language Models and Multi-Armed Bandits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12945</link><description>arXiv:2601.12945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become powerful and widely used systems for language understanding and generation, while multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms provide a principled framework for adaptive decision-making under uncertainty. This survey explores the potential at the intersection of these two fields. As we know, it is the first survey to systematically review the bidirectional interaction between large language models and multi-armed bandits at the component level. We highlight the bidirectional benefits: MAB algorithms address critical LLM challenges, spanning from pre-training to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and personalization. Conversely, LLMs enhance MAB systems by redefining core components such as arm definition and environment modeling, thereby improving decision-making in sequential tasks. We analyze existing LLM-enhanced bandit systems and bandit-enhanced LLM systems, providing insights into their design, methodologies, and performance. Key challenges and representative findings are identified to help guide future research.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly populating medical records with synthetic content, creating a feedback loop where future models are increasingly at risk of training on uncurated AI-generated data. However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12946v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] KinGuard: Hierarchical Kinship-Aware Fingerprinting to Defend Against Large Language Model Stealing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12986</link><description>arXiv:2601.12986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protecting the intellectual property of large language models requires robust ownership verification. Conventional backdoor fingerprinting, however, is flawed by a stealth-robustness paradox: to be robust, these methods force models to memorize fixed responses to high-perplexity triggers, but this targeted overfitting creates detectable statistical artifacts. We resolve this paradox with KinGuard, a framework that embeds a private knowledge corpus built on structured kinship narratives. Instead of memorizing superficial triggers, the model internalizes this knowledge via incremental pre-training, and ownership is verified by probing its conceptual understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate KinGuard's superior effectiveness, stealth, and resilience against a battery of attacks including fine-tuning, input perturbation, and model merging. Our work establishes knowledge-based embedding as a practical and secure paradigm for model fingerprinting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12986v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Influence of Normative Theories of Ethics on the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act: A Transformer-Based Analysis Using Semantic Textual Similarity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13372</link><description>arXiv:2601.13372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite being regarded as a significant step toward regulating Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and its emphasis on fundamental rights, the European Union Artificial Intelligence (EU AI) Act is not immune to moral criticism. This research aims to investigate the impact of three major normative theories of ethics (virtue ethics, deontological ethics, and consequentialism) on the EU AI Act. We introduce the concept of influence, confirmed by philosophical and chronological analysis, to examine the underlying relationship between the theories and the Act. As a proxy measure of this influence, we propose using Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) to quantify the degree of alignment between the theories (influencers) and the Act (influencee). To capture intentional and operational ethical consistency, the Act was divided into two parts: the preamble and the statutory provisions. The textual descriptions of the theories were manually preprocessed to reduce semantic overlap and ensure a distinct representation of each theory. A heterogeneous embedding-level ensemble approach was employed, utilizing five modified Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models, built on the Transformer architecture, to compute STS scores. These scores represent the semantic alignment between various theories of ethics and each of the two components of the EU AI Act. The theories were evaluated by using voting and averaging, with findings indicating that deontological ethics has the most significant overall influence.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13372v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ButterflyMoE: Sub-Linear Ternary Experts via Structured Butterfly Orbits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13563</link><description>arXiv:2601.13563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear memory scaling stores $N$ independent expert weight matrices requiring $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot d^2)$ memory, which exceeds edge devices memory budget. Current compression methods like quantization, pruning and low-rank factorization reduce constant factors but leave the scaling bottleneck unresolved. We introduce ButterflyMoE, a method that treats experts not as independent weight matrices but as geometric reorientations of a unified shared quantized substrate. Diversity among experts arises from viewing different angles of shared capacity, not from redundant storage. By applying learned rotations to a shared ternary prototype, each expert yields $\mathcal{O}(d^2 + N \cdot d \log d)$ memory,sub-linear in the number of experts. The key insight: training these rotations with quantization reduces activation outliers and stabilizes extreme low bit training, where static methods collapse. Across language modeling benchmarks, ButterflyMoE achieves 150$\times$ memory reduction at 256 experts with negligible accuracy loss. ButterflyMoE allows multiple experts to fit on edge-constrained devices showing that geometric parameterization breaks linear scaling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13563v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DRGW: Learning Disentangled Representations for Robust Graph Watermarking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13569</link><description>arXiv:2601.13569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-structured data is foundational to numerous web applications, and watermarking is crucial for protecting their intellectual property and ensuring data provenance. Existing watermarking methods primarily operate on graph structures or entangled graph representations, which compromise the transparency and robustness of watermarks due to the information coupling in representing graphs and uncontrollable discretization in transforming continuous numerical representations into graph structures. This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks. Meanwhile, we devise a graph-aware invertible neural network to provide a lossless channel for watermark embedding and extraction, guaranteeing high detectability and transparency of watermarks. Additionally, we develop a structure-aware editor that resolves the issue of latent modifications into discrete graph edits, ensuring robustness against structural perturbations. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of DRGW.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13569v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Diffusion In Diffusion: Reclaiming Global Coherence in Semi-Autoregressive Diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13599</link><description>arXiv:2601.13599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most compelling features of global discrete diffusion language models is their global bidirectional contextual capability. However, existing block-based diffusion studies tend to introduce autoregressive priors, which, while offering benefits, can cause models to lose this global coherence at the macro level. To regain global contextual understanding while preserving the advantages of the semi-autoregressive paradigm, we propose Diffusion in Diffusion, a 'draft-then-refine' framework designed to overcome the irreversibility and myopia problems inherent in block diffusion models. Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilize snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset. Using only 26% of the fine-tuning budget of baseline models, we reduce generative perplexity from 25.7 to 21.9, significantly narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13599v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VIAFormer: Voxel-Image Alignment Transformer for High-Fidelity Voxel Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13664</link><description>arXiv:2601.13664v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Executable SQL generation is typically studied in text-to-SQL settings, where tables are provided as fully linearized textual schemas and contents. While effective, this formulation assumes access to structured text and incurs substantial token overhead, which is misaligned with many real-world scenarios where tables appear as visual artifacts in documents or webpages. We investigate whether compact optical representations can serve as an efficient interface for executable semantic parsing. We present OptiSQL, a vision-driven framework that generates executable SQL directly from table images and natural language questions using compact optical tokens. OptiSQL leverages an OCR-oriented visual encoder to compress table structure and content into a small set of optical tokens and fine-tunes a pretrained decoder for SQL generation while freezing the encoder to isolate representation sufficiency. Experiments on a visualized version of Spider 2.0-Snow show that OptiSQL retains strong execution accuracy while reducing table input tokens by an order of magnitude. Robustness analyses further demonstrate that optical tokens preserve essential structural information under visual perturbations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13695v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Performance and Complexity Trade-off Optimization of Speech Models During Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13704</link><description>arXiv:2601.13704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In speech machine learning, neural network models are typically designed by choosing an architecture with fixed layer sizes and structure. These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing. The code related to our work is publicly available to encourage further research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13704v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HiT: History-Injection Transformers for Onboard Continuous Flood Change Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13751</link><description>arXiv:2601.13751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural disaster monitoring through continuous satellite observation requires processing multi-temporal data under strict operational constraints. This paper addresses flood detection, a critical application for hazard management, by developing an onboard change detection system that operates within the memory and computational limits of small satellites.

Moreover, testing on the STTORM-CD flood dataset confirms that the HiT mechanism within the Prithvi-tiny foundation model maintains detection accuracy compared to the bitemporal baseline. The proposed HiT-Prithvi model achieved 43 FPS on Jetson Orin Nano, a representative onboard hardware used in nanosats.

Abstract: Aiming at the core problem that it is difficult for a fixed inertia coefficient to balance transient disturbance suppression and long-term stability in complex network synchronization systems, an adaptive inertia control strategy based on variational optimization is proposed. Taking the Kuramoto model with inertia as the research carrier, the analytical expression of the time-varying inertia coefficient M(t) is strictly derived by the functional variational method, and a hierarchical control structure of "benchmark inertia + disturbance feedback" is constructed to achieve the organic unity of minimizing the vulnerability performance function H(T) and stability constraints. A multimodal decoupling control strategy based on Laplacian eigenvector projection is designed to enhance the feedback strength of the dominant mode by eigenvalue weighting, improving the control accuracy and dynamic response speed. Simulation verification is carried out in complex network systems, and the control performance of regular networks (RG), random networks (ER), small-world networks (SW), scale-free networks (SF) and spider webs (SP) under three typical disturbances of pulses, monotonic decays and oscillatory decays is systematically analyzed. The results show that the proposed strategy reduces H(T) of the five networks by 19%-25%, shortens the relaxation time by 15%-24%, and the real parts of all system eigenvalues are less than -0.25s^-1 , meeting the asymptotic stability criterion. This study provides a new theoretical framework and engineering implementation scheme for the stability control of complex network synchronization systems, which can be widely applied to fields such as power grids, communication networks, and neural networks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13753v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DARC: Decoupled Asymmetric Reasoning Curriculum for LLM Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13761</link><description>arXiv:2601.13761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-play with large language models has emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving self-improving artificial intelligence. However, existing self-play frameworks often suffer from optimization instability, due to (i) non-stationary objectives induced by solver-dependent reward feedback for the Questioner, and (ii) bootstrapping errors from self-generated pseudo-labels used to supervise the Solver. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce DARC (Decoupled Asymmetric Reasoning Curriculum), a two-stage framework that stabilizes the self-evolution process. First, we train the Questioner to synthesize difficulty-calibrated questions, conditioned on explicit difficulty levels and external corpora. Second, we train the Solver with an asymmetric self-distillation mechanism, where a document-augmented teacher generates high-quality pseudo-labels to supervise the student Solver that lacks document access. Empirical results demonstrate that DARC is model-agnostic, yielding an average improvement of 10.9 points across nine reasoning benchmarks and three backbone models. Moreover, DARC consistently outperforms all baselines and approaches the performance of fully supervised models without relying on human annotations.

Abstract: Branch misprediction latency is one of the most important contributors to performance degradation and wasted energy consumption in a modern core. State-of-the-art predictors generally perform very well but occasionally suffer from high Misprediction Per Kilo Instruction due to hard-to-predict branches. In this work, we investigate if predicting branches using microarchitectural information, in addition to traditional branch history, can improve prediction accuracy. Our approach considers branch timing information (resolution cycle) both for older branches in the Reorder Buffer (ROB) and recently committed, and for younger branches relative to the branch we re-predict. We propose Speculative Branch Resolution (SBR) in which, N cycles after a branch allocates in the ROB, various timing information is collected and used to re-predict. Using the gem5 simulator we implement and perform a limit-study of SBR using a TAGE-Like predictor. Our experiments show that the post-alloc timing information we used was not able to yield performance gains over an unbounded TAGE-SC. However, we find two hard to predict branches where timing information did provide an advantage and thoroughly analysed one of them to understand why. This finding suggests that predictors may benefit from specific microarchitectural information to increase accuracy on specific hard to predict branches and that overriding predictions in the backend may yet yield performance benefits, but that further research is needed to determine such information vectors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13804v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DroneVLA: VLA based Aerial Manipulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13809</link><description>arXiv:2601.13809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As aerial platforms evolve from passive observers to active manipulators, the challenge shifts toward designing intuitive interfaces that allow non-expert users to command these systems naturally. This work introduces a novel concept of autonomous aerial manipulation system capable of interpreting high-level natural language commands to retrieve objects and deliver them to a human user. The system is intended to integrate a MediaPipe based on Grounding DINO and a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a custom-built drone equipped with a 1-DOF gripper and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera. VLA performs semantic reasoning to interpret the intent of a user prompt and generates a prioritized task queue for grasping of relevant objects in the scene. Grounding DINO and dynamic A* planning algorithm are used to navigate and safely relocate the object. To ensure safe and natural interaction during the handover phase, the system employs a human-centric controller driven by MediaPipe. This module provides real-time human pose estimation, allowing the drone to employ visual servoing to maintain a stable, distinct position directly in front of the user, facilitating a comfortable handover. We demonstrate the system's efficacy through real-world experiments for localization and navigation, which resulted in a 0.164m, 0.070m, and 0.084m of max, mean euclidean, and root-mean squared errors, respectively, highlighting the feasibility of VLA for aerial manipulation operations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13809v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GuideTouch: An Obstacle Avoidance Device with Tactile Feedback for Visually Impaired</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13813</link><description>arXiv:2601.13813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safe navigation for the visually impaired individuals remains a critical challenge, especially concerning head-level obstacles, which traditional mobility aids often fail to detect. We introduce GuideTouch, a compact, affordable, standalone wearable device designed for autonomous obstacle avoidance. The system integrates two vertically aligned Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors, enabling three-dimensional environmental perception, and four vibrotactile actuators that provide directional haptic feedback. Proximity and direction information is communicated via an intuitive 4-point vibrotactile feedback system located across the user's shoulders and upper chest. For real-world robustness, the device includes a unique centrifugal self-cleaning optical cover mechanism and a sound alarm system for location if the device is dropped. We evaluated the haptic perception accuracy across 22 participants (17 male and 5 female, aged 21-48, mean 25.7, sd 6.1). Statistical analysis confirmed a significant difference between the perception accuracy of different patterns. The system demonstrated high recognition accuracy, achieving an average of 92.9% for single and double motor (primary directional) patterns. Furthermore, preliminary experiments with 14 visually impaired users validated this interface, showing a recognition accuracy of 93.75% for primary directional cues. The results demonstrate that GuideTouch enables intuitive spatial perception and could significantly improve the safety, confidence, and autonomy of users with visual impairments during independent navigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13813v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] QKVQA: Question-Focused Filtering for Knowledge-based VQA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13856</link><description>arXiv:2601.13856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) aims to answer questions by integrating images with external knowledge. Effective knowledge filtering is crucial for improving accuracy. Typical filtering methods use similarity metrics to locate relevant article sections from one article, leading to information selection errors at the article and intra-article levels. Although recent explorations of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based filtering methods demonstrate superior semantic understanding and cross-article filtering capabilities, their high computational cost limits practical application. To address these issues, this paper proposes a question-focused filtering method. This approach can perform question-focused, cross-article filtering, efficiently obtaining high-quality filtered knowledge while keeping computational costs comparable to typical methods. Specifically, we design a trainable Question-Focused Filter (QFF) and a Chunk-based Dynamic Multi-Article Selection (CDA) module, which collectively alleviate information selection errors at both the article and intra-article levels. Experiments show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models by 4.9% on E-VQA and 3.8% on InfoSeek, validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning significantly enhances the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), its autoregressive nature incurs prohibitive latency constraints. Current efforts to mitigate this via token compression often fail by blindly applying text-centric metrics to multimodal contexts. We identify a critical failure mode termed Visual Amnesia, where linguistically redundant tokens are erroneously pruned, leading to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce V-Skip that reformulates token pruning as a Visual-Anchored Information Bottleneck (VA-IB) optimization problem. V-Skip employs a dual-path gating mechanism that weighs token importance through both linguistic surprisal and cross-modal attention flow, effectively rescuing visually salient anchors. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL and Llama-3.2 families demonstrate that V-Skip achieves a $2.9\times$ speedup with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, it preserves fine-grained visual details, outperforming other baselines over 30\% on the DocVQA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13879v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RL-BioAug: Label-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Self-Supervised EEG Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13964</link><description>arXiv:2601.13964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quality of data augmentation serves as a critical determinant for the performance of contrastive learning in EEG tasks. Although this paradigm is promising for utilizing unlabeled data, static or random augmentation strategies often fail to preserve intrinsic information due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals where statistical properties change over time. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69% and 8.80% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Notably, this agent mainly chose optimal strategies for each task--for example, Time Masking with a 62% probability for sleep stage classification and Crop &amp; Resize with a 77% probability for seizure detection. Our framework suggests its potential to replace conventional heuristic-based augmentations and establish a new autonomous paradigm for data augmentation.

Abstract: We introduce BallotRank, a ranked preference aggregation method derived from a modified PageRank algorithm. It is a Condorcet-consistent method without damping, and empirical examination of nearly 2,000 ranked choice elections and over 20,000 internet polls confirms that BallotRank always identifies the Condorcet winner at conventional values of the damping parameter. We also prove that the method satisfies many of the same social choice criteria as other well-known Condorcet completion methods, but it has the advantage of being a natural social welfare function that provides a full ranking of the candidates.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14015v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human detectors are surprisingly powerful reward models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14037</link><description>arXiv:2601.14037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video generation models have recently achieved impressive visual fidelity and temporal coherence. Yet, they continue to struggle with complex, non-rigid motions, especially when synthesizing humans performing dynamic actions such as sports, dance, etc. Generated videos often exhibit missing or extra limbs, distorted poses, or physically implausible actions. In this work, we propose a remarkably simple reward model, HuDA, to quantify and improve the human motion in generated videos. HuDA integrates human detection confidence for appearance quality, and a temporal prompt alignment score to capture motion realism. We show this simple reward function that leverages off-the-shelf models without any additional training, outperforms specialized models finetuned with manually annotated data. Using HuDA for Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) post-training of video models, we significantly enhance video generation, especially when generating complex human motions, outperforming state-of-the-art models like Wan 2.1, with win-rate of 73%. Finally, we demonstrate that HuDA improves generation quality beyond just humans, for instance, significantly improving generation of animal videos and human-object interactions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14037v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning to Explain: Supervised Token Attribution from Transformer Attention Patterns</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14112</link><description>arXiv:2601.14112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become critical as transformer-based models are deployed in high-stakes applications including healthcare, legal systems, and financial services, where opacity hinders trust and accountability. Transformers self-attention mechanisms have proven valuable for model interpretability, with attention weights successfully used to understand model focus and behavior (Xu et al., 2015); (Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019). However, existing attention-based explanation methods rely on manually defined aggregation strategies and fixed attribution rules (Abnar and Zuidema, 2020a); (Chefer et al., 2021), while model-agnostic approaches (LIME, SHAP) treat the model as a black box and incur significant computational costs through input perturbation. We introduce Explanation Network (ExpNet), a lightweight neural network that learns an explicit mapping from transformer attention patterns to token-level importance scores. Unlike prior methods, ExpNet discovers optimal attention feature combinations automatically rather than relying on predetermined rules. We evaluate ExpNet in a challenging cross-task setting and benchmark it against a broad spectrum of model-agnostic methods and attention-based techniques spanning four methodological families.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14112v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Weakly-supervised segmentation using inherently-explainable classification models and their application to brain tumour classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05148</link><description>arXiv:2206.05148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated significant potential in medical imaging; however, the opacity of "black-box" models hinders clinical trust, while segmentation tasks typically necessitate labourious, hard-to-obtain pixel-wise annotations. To address these challenges simultaneously, this paper introduces a framework for three inherently explainable classifiers (GP-UNet, GP-ShuffleUNet, and GP-ReconResNet). By integrating a global pooling mechanism, these networks generate localisation heatmaps that directly influence classification decisions, offering inherent interpretability without relying on potentially unreliable post-hoc methods. These heatmaps are subsequently thresholded to achieve weakly-supervised segmentation, requiring only image-level classification labels for training. Validated on two datasets for multi-class brain tumour classification, the proposed models achieved a peak F1-score of 0.93. For the weakly-supervised segmentation task, a median Dice score of 0.728 (95% CI 0.715-0.739) was recorded. Notably, on a subset of tumour-only images, the best model achieved an accuracy of 98.7%, outperforming state-of-the-art glioma grading binary classifiers. Furthermore, comparative Precision-Recall analysis validated the framework's robustness against severe class imbalance, establishing a direct correlation between diagnostic confidence and segmentation fidelity. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully combines high diagnostic accuracy with essential transparency, offering a promising direction for trustworthy clinical decision support.

Abstract: With the fast development of big data, learning the optimal decision rule by recursively updating it and making online decisions has been easier than before. We study the online statistical inference of model parameters in a contextual bandit framework of sequential decision-making. We propose a general framework for an online and adaptive data collection environment that can update decision rules via weighted stochastic gradient descent. We allow different weighting schemes of the stochastic gradient and establish the asymptotic normality of the parameter estimator. Our proposed estimator significantly improves the asymptotic efficiency over the previous averaged SGD approach via inverse probability weights. We also conduct an optimality analysis on the weights in a linear regression setting. We provide a Bahadur representation of the proposed estimator and show that the remainder term in the Bahadur representation entails a slower convergence rate compared to classical SGD due to the adaptive data collection.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2212.14883v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning minimal representations of stochastic processes with variational autoencoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11608</link><description>arXiv:2307.11608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic processes have found numerous applications in science, as they are broadly used to model a variety of natural phenomena. Due to their intrinsic randomness and uncertainty, they are, however, difficult to characterize. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine the minimal set of parameters required to effectively describe the dynamics of a stochastic process. Our method builds upon an extended $\beta$-variational autoencoder architecture. By means of simulated datasets corresponding to paradigmatic diffusion models, we showcase its effectiveness in extracting the minimal relevant parameters that accurately describe these dynamics. Furthermore, the method enables the generation of new trajectories that faithfully replicate the expected stochastic behavior. Overall, our approach enables the autonomous discovery of unknown parameters describing stochastic processes, hence enhancing our comprehension of complex phenomena across various fields.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2307.11608v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Connecting Kani's Lemma and path-finding in the Bruhat-Tits tree to compute supersingular endomorphism rings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05059</link><description>arXiv:2402.05059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to compute the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve in characteristic p, provided that we are given two noncommuting endomorphisms and the factorization of the discriminant of the ring $\mathcal{O}_0$ they generate. At each prime $q$ for which $\mathcal{O}_0$ is not maximal, we compute the endomorphism ring locally by computing a q-maximal order containing it and, when $q \neq p$, recovering a path to $\text{End}(E) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_q$ in the Bruhat-Tits tree. We use techniques of higher-dimensional isogenies to navigate towards the local endomorphism ring. Our algorithm improves on a previous algorithm which requires a restricted input and runs in subexponential time under certain heuristics. Page and Wesolowski give a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm to compute the endomorphism ring on input of a single non-scalar endomorphism. Beyond using techniques of higher-dimensional isogenies to divide endomorphisms by a scalar, our methods are completely different.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2402.05059v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Reduced Groebner Bases With Double Exponential Cardinality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17602</link><description>arXiv:2411.17602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross

Abstract: Colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) exhibits high postoperative recurrence and pronounced prognostic heterogeneity, challenging individualized management. Existing prognostic approaches often rely on static representations from a single postoperative snapshot, and fail to jointly capture tumor spatial distribution, longitudinal disease dynamics, and multimodal clinical information, limiting predictive accuracy. We propose DyPro, a deep learning framework that infers postoperative latent trajectories via residual dynamic evolution. Starting from an initial patient representation, DyPro generates a 12-step sequence of trajectory snapshots through autoregressive residual updates and integrates them to predict recurrence and survival outcomes. On the MSKCC CRLM dataset, DyPro achieves strong discrimination under repeated stratified 5-fold cross-validation, reaching a C-index of 0.755 for OS and 0.714 for DFS, with OS AUC@1y of 0.920 and OS IBS of 0.143. DyPro provides quantitative risk cues to support adjuvant therapy planning and follow-up scheduling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.03123v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Recovery of the matrix potential of the one-dimensional Dirac equation from spectral data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04010</link><description>arXiv:2505.04010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

Abstract: Cluster analysis, or clustering, plays a crucial role across numerous scientific and engineering domains. Despite the wealth of clustering methods proposed over the past decades, each method is typically designed for specific scenarios and presents certain limitations in practical applications. In this paper, we propose depth-based local center clustering (DLCC). This novel method makes use of data depth, which is known to produce a center-outward ordering of sample points in a multivariate space. However, data depth typically fails to capture the multimodal characteristics of {data}, something of the utmost importance in the context of clustering. To overcome this, DLCC makes use of a local version of data depth that is based on subsets of {data}. From this, local centers can be identified as well as clusters of varying shapes. Furthermore, we propose a new internal metric based on density-based clustering to evaluate clustering performance on {non-convex clusters}. Overall, DLCC is a flexible clustering approach that seems to overcome some limitations of traditional clustering methods, thereby enhancing data analysis capabilities across a wide range of application scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.09516v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Approach to Quantum Contraction and Correlation Coefficients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15281</link><description>arXiv:2505.15281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical information theory, the maximal correlation and $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficient establish limits on distributed and sequential processing. Two distinct quantum maximal correlation coefficients have been proposed, but they do not extend all the classical results. Building on work of Petz, we use the family of non-commutative $L^{2}(p)$ spaces that extend the data processing inequality for variance to quantum theory to extend the classical results to quantum theory. We introduce families of quantum maximal correlation coefficients and identify quantum $\chi^{2}$-divergences as non-commutative generalizations of the variance of the likelihood ratio. We establish a family of maximal correlation coefficients that must all be ordered on a single copy level for an arbitrary number of copies of one state to be able to be converted to a single copy of another target state under local operations. We prove the equivalent characterizations of perfect classical correlation extraction via local operations in quantum theory. We clarify the relationship between maximal correlation and $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficients by proving they are the same operator norms evaluated on distinct maps. Then we establish new equivalent conditions to the saturation of the data processing inequality for $\chi^{2}$-divergences. This implies previous saturation results for the $\chi^{2}$ and sandwiched R\'{e}nyi divergences. Finally, we establish the quantum maximal correlation coefficients and $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficients are often efficiently computable. This results in a generic method for efficiently computing mixing times of time-homogeneous quantum Markov chains with a unique full rank fixed point.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.15281v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] New Perspectives on the Polyak Stepsize: Surrogate Functions and Negative Results</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20219</link><description>arXiv:2505.20219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Polyak stepsize has been proven to be a fundamental stepsize in convex optimization, giving near optimal gradient descent rates across a wide range of assumptions. The universality of the Polyak stepsize has also inspired many stochastic variants, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. Despite the many theoretical results, our understanding of the convergence properties and shortcomings of the Polyak stepsize or its variants is both incomplete and fractured across different analyses. We propose a new, unified, and simple perspective for the Polyak stepsize and its variants as gradient descent on a surrogate loss. We show that each variant is equivalent to minimize a surrogate function with stepsizes that adapt to a guaranteed local curvature. Our general surrogate loss perspective is then used to provide a unified analysis of existing variants across different assumptions. Moreover, we show a number of negative results proving that the non-convergence results in some of the upper bounds is indeed real.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.20219v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Numerical Optimization Strategies for the Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz in Noisy Quantum Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22398</link><description>arXiv:2505.22398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of variational methods in near-term quantum computing makes optimizer choice critical, yet selection is frequently intuition-based. We therefore present a systematic benchmark of eight classical optimization algorithms for variational quantum chemistry using the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz. Performance is evaluated on H$_2$, H$_4$, and LiH in both full and active-space representations under noiseless and finite-shot sampling noise. Sampling noise substantially reshapes cost landscapes, induces wandering near minima, and flips optimizer rankings: gradient-based methods perform best in noiseless simulations, whereas population-based optimizers, particularly CMA-ES, show greater robustness under finite-shot noise. Optimizer performance is strongly problem dependent: Hartree-Fock initialization aids small systems, but its advantage diminishes with system size. Also, we observe that finite shot sampling frequently violates the lower bound given by the variational principle, a principle that cannot be strictly held in the presence of noise. By exploiting the guaranteed convergence of Evolution Strategies to a steady state distribution defined by the noise floor, we utilize the symmetry of these violations to achieve energy estimation precision beyond the intrinsic sampling limit.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.22398v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Development and Evaluation of an Ontology for Non-Invasive Respiratory Support in Acute Care</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19992</link><description>arXiv:2507.19992v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Managing patients with respiratory failure increasingly involves noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS) strategies to support respiration, often preventing the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. However, despite the rapidly expanding use of NIRS, there remains a significant challenge to its optimal use across all medical circumstances. It lacks a unified ontological structure, complicating guidance on NIRS modalities across healthcare systems. This study introduced NIRS ontology to support knowledge representation in acute care settings by providing a unified framework that enhances data clarity and interoperability, laying the groundwork for future clinical decision-making. We developed NIRS ontology using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding a sample of 6 patient scenarios and used SPARQL queries to retrieve and test targeted inferences. The ontology has 145 classes, 11 object properties, and 18 data properties across 949 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 392 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL query evaluations across clinical scenarios confirmed the ontology ability to support rule based reasoning and therapy recommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices, integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes. In conclusion, we unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.19992v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Whitening Spherical Gaussian Mixtures in the Large-Dimensional Regime</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17636</link><description>arXiv:2509.17636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whitening is a classical technique in unsupervised learning that can facilitate estimation tasks by standardizing data. An important application is the estimation of latent variable models via the decomposition of tensors built from high-order moments. In particular, whitening orthogonalizes the means of a spherical Gaussian mixture model (GMM), thereby making the corresponding moment tensor orthogonally decomposable, hence easier to decompose. However, in the large-dimensional regime (LDR) where data are high-dimensional and scarce, the standard whitening matrix built from the sample covariance becomes ineffective because the latter is spectrally distorted. Consequently, whitened means of a spherical GMM are no longer orthogonal. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact limits for their dot products, which are generally nonzero in the LDR. As our main contribution, we then construct a corrected whitening matrix that restores asymptotic orthogonality, allowing for performance gains in spherical GMM estimation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.17636v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Causal Regime Detection in Energy Markets With Augmented Time Series Structural Causal Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04361</link><description>arXiv:2511.04361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

We integrate neural causal discovery to learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring ground truth DAGs. Applied to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables novel counterfactual queries such as "What would prices be under different renewable generation scenarios?".</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.04361v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Omni-AVSR: Towards Unified Multimodal Speech Recognition with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07253</link><description>arXiv:2511.07253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in speech recognition across multiple modalities, including Auditory Speech Recognition (ASR), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.07253v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Principled Coarse-Grained Acceptance for Speculative Decoding in Speech</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13732</link><description>arXiv:2511.13732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive speech generation by letting a fast draft model propose tokens that a larger target model verifies. However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity. These results suggest acoustically aware, group-level acceptance as a simple and general way to accelerate speech token generation while maintaining speech quality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.13732v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ultra-Strong Gradient Diffusion MRI with Self-Supervised Learning for Prostate Cancer Characterization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03196</link><description>arXiv:2512.03196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) enables non-invasive assessment of prostate microstructure but conventional dMRI metrics such as the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient in multiparametric MRI and reflect a mixture of underlying tissues features rather than distinct histologic characteristics. Integrating dMRI with the compartment-based biophysical VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) framework offers richer microstructural insights, though clinical gradient systems (40-80 mT/m) often suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio at stronger diffusion weightings due to prolonged echo times. Ultra-strong gradients (e.g., 300 mT/m) can mitigate these limitations by improving SNR and contrast-to-noise ratios. This study investigates whether physics-informed self-supervised VERDICT (ssVERDICT) fitting when combined with ultra-strong gradient data, enhances prostate microstructural characterization relative to current fitting approaches and clinical gradient systems. We developed enhanced ssVERDICT fitting approaches using dense multilayer perceptron and convolutional U-Net architectures, comparing them against non-linear least-squares (NLLS) VERDICT fitting, original ssVERDICT implementation, and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging across clinical- to ultra-strong gradient systems. For the same ultra-strong gradient data, Dense ssVERDICT outperformed NLLS VERDICT, boosting median CNR by 47%, cutting inter-patient Coefficient of Variation by 52%, and reducing pooled $f_{ic}$ variation by 50%. Overall, Dense ssVERDICT delivered the highest CNR, the most stable parameter estimates, and the clearest tumour-normal contrast compared with conventional fitting methods and clinical gradient systems. These findings underscore that meaningful gains in non-invasive prostate cancer characterization arise from the combination of advanced gradient systems and deep learning-based modelling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.03196v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cluster-Based Generalized Additive Models Informed by Random Fourier Features</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19373</link><description>arXiv:2512.19373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the development of learning systems, there is an ongoing need to reconcile the strong predictive performance offered by opaque black-box models with the level of transparency required for critical applications. This work introduces a methodological framework that combines spectral representation learning with transparent statistical modeling to construct a mixture of generalized additive models (GAMs). The approach utilizes random Fourier feature embeddings to uncover locally adaptive structures within the data. High-dimensional random feature representations are compressed via principal component analysis to derive a latent space that informs a Gaussian mixture model, which performs soft clustering to partition the input space into distinct regimes. Within each cluster, a local GAM captures nonlinear univariate effects through interpretable spline-based smoothers. Numerical experiments across diverse regression benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves upon classical global interpretable models by effectively modeling data heterogeneity. Furthermore, the mixture-of-GAMs framework achieves performance comparable to explainable boosting machine, random forest, and multilayer perceptron on certain tasks. Overall, this construction provides a principled approach for integrating representation learning with transparent statistical modeling.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19373v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Development and Experimental Validation of Novel Evaluation Criteria for Turbulent Two-Phase VOF Simulations in High-Pressure Die Casting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05701</link><description>arXiv:2601.05701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Air entrapment during mold filling critically affects porosity and overall casting quality in High Pressure Die Casting. This study assesses the feasibility of applying the vof method within OpenFOAM to simulate compressible, turbulent mold filling in a thin-walled geometry. Three-dimensional simulations with the "compressibleInterFoam" solver were carried out under ambient initial cavity conditions, using both laminar flow and the k-e turbulence model. The free surface dynamics were examined across a range of inlet velocities to evaluate their influence on interface morphology, cavity pressurization, and gas entrapment. To quantify these effects, three evaluation criteria were introduced: the TIFSA as a measure of oxidation risk, the TMVF as an indicator of filling continuity and air entrapment, and the TIVF as a proxy for surface loading. Results show that turbulence modeling accelerates pressurization and limits the persistence of entrapped gas, with velocity governing the balance between smooth filling, turbulent breakup, and exposure duration. Comparison with experimental casting trials, including CT based porosity analysis and photogrammetric surface evaluation, validated that the model captures key defect mechanisms and provides quantitative guidance for process optimization.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05701v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Informed Singular-Value Learning for Cross-Covariances Forecasting in Financial Markets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07687</link><description>arXiv:2601.07687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new wave of work on covariance cleaning and nonlinear shrinkage has delivered asymptotically optimal analytical solutions for large covariance matrices. The same framework has been generalized to empirical cross-covariance matrices, whose singular value decomposition identifies canonical comovement modes between two asset sets, with singular values quantifying the strength of each mode and providing natural targets for shrinkage. Existing analytical cross-covariance cleaners are derived under strong stationarity and large-sample assumptions, and they typically rely on mesoscopic regularity conditions such as bounded spectra; macroscopic common modes (e.g., a global market factor) violate these conditions. When applied to real equity returns, where dependence structures drift over time and global modes are prominent, we find that these theoretically optimal formulas do not translate into robust out-of-sample performance. We address this gap by designing a random-matrix-inspired neural architecture that operates in the empirical singular-vector basis and learns a nonlinear mapping from empirical singular values to their corresponding cleaned values. By construction, the network can recover the analytical solution as a special case, yet it remains flexible enough to adapt to non-stationary dynamics and mode-driven distortions. Trained on a long history of equity returns, the proposed method achieves a more favorable bias-variance trade-off than purely analytical cleaners and delivers systematically lower out-of-sample cross-covariance prediction errors. Our results demonstrate that combining random-matrix theory with machine learning makes asymptotic theories practically effective in realistic time-varying markets.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07687v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion-Based Residual Anomaly Map for Resource-Efficient Glioma MRI Segmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11833</link><description>arXiv:2601.11833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning is currently the state-of-the-art for brain tumor segmentation, yet it requires either large datasets or extensive computational resources that are inaccessible in most areas. This makes the problem increasingly difficult: state-of-the-art models use thousands of training cases and vast computational power, where performance drops sharply when either is limited. The top performer in the Brats GLI 2023 competition relied on supercomputers trained on over 92,000 augmented MRI scans using an AMD EPYC 7402 CPU, six NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs (48GB VRAM each), and 1024GB of RAM over multiple weeks. To address this, the Karhunen--Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE) was implemented as a feature extraction step on downsampled, z-score normalized MRI volumes. Each 240$\times$240$\times$155 multi-modal scan is reduced to four $48^3$ channels and compressed into 32 KL coefficients. The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases. This model achieves post-processed Dice scores of 0.929 (WT), 0.856 (TC), and 0.821 (ET), with HD95 distances of 2.93, 6.78, and 10.35 voxels. These results are significantly better than the winning BraTS 2023 methodology for HD95 distances and WT dice scores. This demonstrates that a KLE-based residual anomaly map can dramatically reduce computational cost and data requirements while retaining state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11833v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Drift-Aware Predictive Transfer: Toward Durable Clinical AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11860</link><description>arXiv:2601.11860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical AI systems frequently suffer performance decay post-deployment due to temporal data shifts, such as evolving populations, diagnostic coding updates (e.g., ICD-9 to ICD-10), and systemic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing this ``aging'' effect via frequent retraining is often impractical due to computational costs and privacy constraints. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce Adversarial Drift-Aware Predictive Transfer (ADAPT), a novel framework designed to confer durability against temporal drift with minimal retraining. ADAPT innovatively constructs an uncertainty set of plausible future models by combining historical source models and limited current data. By optimizing worst-case performance over this set, it balances current accuracy with robustness against degradation due to future drifts. Crucially, ADAPT requires only summary-level model estimators from historical periods, preserving data privacy and ensuring operational simplicity. Validated on longitudinal suicide risk prediction using electronic health records from Mass General Brigham (2005--2021) and Duke University Health Systems, ADAPT demonstrated superior stability across coding transitions and pandemic-induced shifts. By minimizing annual performance decay without labeling or retraining future data, ADAPT offers a scalable pathway for sustaining reliable AI in high-stakes healthcare environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11860v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Provable Suboptimality of Momentum SGD in Nonstationary Stochastic Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12238</link><description>arXiv:2601.12238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While momentum-based acceleration has been studied extensively in deterministic optimization problems, its behavior in nonstationary environments -- where the data distribution and optimal parameters drift over time -- remains underexplored. We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12238v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Rotary Steering with Joint Autoregression for Robust Extraction of Closely Moving Speakers in Dynamic Scenarios</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12345</link><description>arXiv:2601.12345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latest advances in deep spatial filtering for Ambisonics demonstrate strong performance in stationary multi-speaker scenarios by rotating the sound field toward a target speaker prior to multi-channel enhancement. For applicability in dynamic acoustic conditions with moving speakers, we propose to automate this rotary steering using an interleaved tracking algorithm conditioned on the target's initial direction. However, for nearby or crossing speakers, robust tracking becomes difficult and spatial cues less effective for enhancement. By incorporating the processed recording as additional guide into both algorithms, our novel joint autoregressive framework leverages temporal-spectral correlations of speech to resolve spatially challenging speaker constellations. Consequently, our proposed method significantly improves tracking and enhancement of closely spaced speakers, consistently outperforming comparable non-autoregressive methods on a synthetic dataset. Real-world recordings complement these findings in complex scenarios with multiple speaker crossings and varying speaker-to-array distances.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12345v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deterministic and probabilistic neural surrogates of global hybrid-Vlasov simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12614</link><description>arXiv:2601.12614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid-Vlasov simulations resolve ion-kinetic effects for modeling the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, but even 5D (2D + 3V) simulations are computationally expensive. We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12614v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SciHorizon-GENE: Benchmarking LLM for Life Sciences Inference from Gene Knowledge to Functional Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12805</link><description>arXiv:2601.12805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown growing promise in biomedical research, particularly for knowledge-driven interpretation tasks. However, their ability to reliably reason from gene-level knowledge to functional understanding, a core requirement for knowledge-enhanced cell atlas interpretation, remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce SciHorizon-GENE, a large-scale gene-centric benchmark constructed from authoritative biological databases. The benchmark integrates curated knowledge for over 190K human genes and comprises more than 540K questions covering diverse gene-to-function reasoning scenarios relevant to cell type annotation, functional interpretation, and mechanism-oriented analysis. Motivated by behavioral patterns observed in preliminary examinations, SciHorizon-GENE evaluates LLMs along four biologically critical perspectives: research attention sensitivity, hallucination tendency, answer completeness, and literature influence, explicitly targeting failure modes that limit the safe adoption of LLMs in biological interpretation pipelines. We systematically evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art general-purpose and biomedical LLMs, revealing substantial heterogeneity in gene-level reasoning capabilities and persistent challenges in generating faithful, complete, and literature-grounded functional interpretations. Our benchmark establishes a systematic foundation for analyzing LLM behavior at the gene scale and offers insights for model selection and development, with direct relevance to knowledge-enhanced biological interpretation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12805v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact: extension to linear viscoelasticity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13818</link><description>arXiv:2601.13818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the distributed rolling contact FrBD framework to linear viscoelasticity by considering classic derivative Generalised Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt rheological representations of the bristle element. With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects. The findings of this paper substantially advance the FrBD paradigm by enabling a unified and systematic treatment of linear viscoelasticity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13818v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SynQP: A Framework and Metrics for Evaluating the Quality and Privacy Risk of Synthetic Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12124</link><description>arXiv:2601.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of synthetic data in health applications raises privacy concerns, yet the lack of open frameworks for privacy evaluations has slowed its adoption. A major challenge is the absence of accessible benchmark datasets for evaluating privacy risks, due to difficulties in acquiring sensitive data. To address this, we introduce SynQP, an open framework for benchmarking privacy in synthetic data generation (SDG) using simulated sensitive data, ensuring that original data remains confidential. We also highlight the need for privacy metrics that fairly account for the probabilistic nature of machine learning models. As a demonstration, we use SynQP to benchmark CTGAN and propose a new identity disclosure risk metric that offers a more accurate estimation of privacy risks compared to existing approaches. Our work provides a critical tool for improving the transparency and reliability of privacy evaluations, enabling safer use of synthetic data in health-related applications. % In our quality evaluations, non-private models achieved near-perfect machine-learning efficacy \(\ge0.97\). Our privacy assessments (Table II) reveal that DP consistently lowers both identity disclosure risk (SD-IDR) and membership-inference attack risk (SD-MIA), with all DP-augmented models staying below the 0.09 regulatory threshold.

Abstract: Existing 3D human motion generation and understanding methods often exhibit limited interpretability, restricting effective mutual enhancement between these inherently related tasks. While current unified frameworks based on large language models (LLMs) leverage linguistic priors, they frequently encounter challenges in semantic alignment and task coherence. Moreover, the next-token prediction paradigm in LLMs is ill-suited for motion sequences, causing cumulative prediction errors. To address these limitations, we propose UniMo, a novel framework that integrates motion-language information and interpretable chain of thought (CoT) reasoning into the LLM via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We further introduce reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a post-training strategy that optimizes over groups of tokens to enforce structural correctness and semantic alignment, mitigating cumulative errors in motion token prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMo significantly outperforms existing unified and task-specific models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both motion generation and understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12126v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SolarGPT-QA: A Domain-Adaptive Large Language Model for Educational Question Answering in Space Weather and Heliophysics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12131</link><description>arXiv:2601.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar activity, including solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and geomagnetic storms, can significantly impact satellites, aviation, power grids, data centers, and space missions. Extreme solar events can cause substantial economic damage if not predicted in advance, highlighting the importance of accurate forecasting and effective education in space science. Although large language models (LLMs) perform well on general tasks, they often lack domain-specific knowledge and pedagogical capability to clearly explain complex space science concepts.
  We introduce SolarGPT-QA, a question answering system based on a domain-adapted large language model built on the LLaMA-3 base model. The model is trained using scientific literature and large-scale question-answer data generated with GPT-4 and refined using Grok-3 in a student-friendly storytelling style. Human pairwise evaluations show that SolarGPT-QA outperforms general-purpose models in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance compared to instruction-tuned models for educational explanations in space weather and heliophysics. A small pilot student comprehension study further suggests improved clarity and accessibility of the generated explanations. Ablation experiments indicate that combining domain-adaptive pretraining with pedagogical fine-tuning is important for balancing scientific accuracy and educational effectiveness. This work represents an initial step toward a broader SolarGPT framework for space science education and forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12131v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bengali Text Classification: An Evaluation of Large Language Model Approaches</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12132</link><description>arXiv:2601.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bengali text classification is a Significant task in natural language processing (NLP), where text is categorized into predefined labels. Unlike English, Bengali faces challenges due to the lack of extensive annotated datasets and pre-trained language models. This study explores the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in classifying Bengali newspaper articles. The dataset used, obtained from Kaggle, consists of articles from Prothom Alo, a major Bangladeshi newspaper. Three instruction-tuned LLMs LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, LLaMA 3.2 3B Instruct, and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct were evaluated for this task under the same classification framework. Among the evaluated models, Qwen 2.5 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 72%, showing particular strength in the "Sports" category. In comparison, LLaMA 3.1 and LLaMA 3.2 attained accuracies of 53% and 56%, respectively. The findings highlight the effectiveness of LLMs in Bengali text classification, despite the scarcity of resources for Bengali NLP. Future research will focus on exploring additional models, addressing class imbalance issues, and refining fine-tuning approaches to improve classification performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Human-Human-AI Triadic Programming: Uncovering the Role of AI Agent and the Value of Human Partner in Collaborative Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12134</link><description>arXiv:2601.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI assistance becomes embedded in programming practice, researchers have increasingly examined how these systems help learners generate code and work more efficiently. However, these studies often position AI as a replacement for human collaboration and overlook the social and learning-oriented aspects that emerge in collaborative programming. Our work introduces human-human-AI (HHAI) triadic programming, where an AI agent serves as an additional collaborator rather than a substitute for a human partner. Through a within-subjects study with 20 participants, we show that triadic collaboration enhances collaborative learning and social presence compared to the dyadic human-AI (HAI) baseline. In the triadic HHAI conditions, participants relied significantly less on AI-generated code in their work. This effect was strongest in the HHAI-shared condition, where participants had an increased sense of responsibility to understand AI suggestions before applying them. These findings demonstrate how triadic settings activate socially shared regulation of learning by making AI use visible and accountable to a human peer, suggesting that AI systems that augment rather than automate peer collaboration can better preserve the learning processes that collaborative programming relies on.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12134v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoSMeTIC: Zero-Knowledge Computational Sparse Merkle Trees with Inclusion-Exclusion Proofs for Clinical Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12136</link><description>arXiv:2601.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of clinical data is a cornerstone of biomedical research with applications in areas such as genomic testing and response characterization of therapeutic drugs. Maintaining strict privacy controls is essential because such data typically contains personally identifiable health information of patients. At the same time, regulatory compliance often requires study managers to demonstrate the integrity and authenticity of participant data used in analyses. Balancing these competing requirements, privacy preservation and verifiable accountability, remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present CoSMeTIC, a zero-knowledge computational framework that proposes computational Sparse Merkle Trees (SMTs) as a means to generate verifiable inclusion and exclusion proofs for individual participants' data in clinical studies. We formally analyze the zero-knowledge properties of CoSMeTIC and evaluate its computational efficiency through extensive experiments. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and likelihood-ratio hypothesis tests, along with logistic-regression-based genomic analyses on real-world Huntington's disease datasets, we demonstrate that CoSMeTIC achieves strong privacy guarantees while maintaining statistical fidelity. Our results suggest that CoSMeTIC provides a scalable and practical alternative for achieving regulatory compliance with rigorous privacy protection in large-scale clinical research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12136v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EMoE: Eigenbasis-Guided Routing for Mixture-of-Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12137</link><description>arXiv:2601.12137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relentless scaling of deep learning models has led to unsustainable computational demands, positioning Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures as a promising path towards greater efficiency. However, MoE models are plagued by two fundamental challenges: 1) a load imbalance problem known as the``rich get richer" phenomenon, where a few experts are over-utilized, and 2) an expert homogeneity problem, where experts learn redundant representations, negating their purpose. Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space. This principled, geometric partitioning of data intrinsically promotes both balanced expert utilization and the development of diverse, specialized experts, all without the need for a conflicting auxiliary loss function.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into vehicle-based digital assistants, where unsafe, ambiguous, or legally incorrect responses can lead to serious safety, ethical, and regulatory consequences. Despite growing interest in LLM safety, existing taxonomies and evaluation frameworks remain largely general-purpose and fail to capture the domain-specific risks inherent to real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce DriveSafe, a hierarchical, four-level risk taxonomy designed to systematically characterize safety-critical failure modes of LLM-based driving assistants. The taxonomy comprises 129 fine-grained atomic risk categories spanning technical, legal, societal, and ethical dimensions, grounded in real-world driving regulations and safety principles and reviewed by domain experts. To validate the safety relevance and realism of the constructed prompts, we evaluate their refusal behavior across six widely deployed LLMs. Our analysis shows that the evaluated models often fail to appropriately refuse unsafe or non-compliant driving-related queries, underscoring the limitations of general-purpose safety alignment in driving contexts.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12138v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TIDE: A Trace-Informed Depth-First Exploration for Planning with Temporally Extended Goals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12141</link><description>arXiv:2601.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task planning with temporally extended goals (TEGs) is a critical challenge in AI and robotics, enabling agents to achieve complex sequences of objectives over time rather than addressing isolated, immediate tasks. Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12141v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Neural Process-Based Reactive Controller for Autonomous Racing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12143</link><description>arXiv:2601.12143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention-based neural architectures have become central to state-of-the-art methods in real-time nonlinear control. As these data-driven models continue to be integrated into increasingly safety-critical domains, ensuring statistically grounded and provably safe decision-making becomes essential. This paper introduces a novel reactive control framework for gap-based navigation using the Attentive Neural Process (AttNP) and a physics-informed extension, the PI-AttNP. Both models are evaluated in a simulated F1TENTH-style Ackermann steering racecar environment, chosen as a fast-paced proxy for safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios. The PI-AttNP augments the AttNP architecture with approximate model-based priors to inject physical inductive bias, enabling faster convergence and improved prediction accuracy suited for real-time control. To further ensure safety, we derive and implement a control barrier function (CBF)-based filtering mechanism that analytically enforces collision avoidance constraints. This CBF formulation is fully compatible with the learned AttNP controller and generalizes across a wide range of racing scenarios, providing a lightweight and certifiable safety layer. Our results demonstrate competitive closed-loop performance while ensuring real-time constraint satisfaction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12143v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Threshold Differential Attention for Sink-Free, Ultra-Sparse, and Non-Dispersive Language Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12145</link><description>arXiv:2601.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Softmax attention struggles with long contexts due to structural limitations: the strict sum-to-one constraint forces attention sinks on irrelevant tokens, and probability mass disperses as sequence lengths increase. We tackle these problems with Threshold Differential Attention (TDA), a sink-free attention mechanism that achieves ultra-sparsity and improved robustness at longer sequence lengths without the computational overhead of projection methods or the performance degradation caused by noise accumulation of standard rectified attention. TDA applies row-wise extreme-value thresholding with a length-dependent gate, retaining only exceedances. Inspired by the differential transformer, TDA also subtracts an inhibitory view to enhance expressivity. Theoretically, we prove that TDA controls the expected number of spurious survivors per row to $O(1)$ and that consensus spurious matches across independent views vanish as context grows. Empirically, TDA produces $&gt;99\%$ exact zeros and eliminates attention sinks while maintaining competitive performance on standard and long-context benchmarks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12145v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From LLMs to Agents in Programming: The Impact of Providing an LLM with a Compiler</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12146</link><description>arXiv:2601.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated a remarkable capability in natural language and program generation and software development. However, the source code generated by the LLMs does not always meet quality requirements and may fail to compile. Therefore, many studies evolve into agents that can reason about the problem before generating the source code for the solution. The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a \texttt{gcc} compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program. Syntax errors dropped by 75\%, and errors related to undefined references dropped by 87\% for the tasks where the agents outperformed the baselines. We also observed that in some cases, smaller models with a compiler outperform larger models with a compiler. We conclude that it is essential for LLMs to have access to software engineering tools to enhance their performance and reduce the need for large models in software engineering, such as reducing our energy footprint.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12146v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Segment and Matte Anything in a Unified Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12147</link><description>arXiv:2601.12147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) has recently pushed the boundaries of segmentation by demonstrating zero-shot generalization and flexible prompting after training on over one billion masks. Despite this, its mask prediction accuracy often falls short of the precision required in real-world applications. While several refinement modules have been proposed to boost SAM's segmentation quality, achieving highly accurate object delineation within a single, unified framework remains an open challenge. Furthermore, interactive image matting, which aims to generate fine-grained alpha mattes guided by diverse user hints, has not yet been explored in the context of SAM. Insights from recent studies highlight strong correlations between segmentation and matting, suggesting the feasibility of a unified model capable of both tasks. In this paper, we introduce Segment And Matte Anything (SAMA), a lightweight extension of SAM that delivers high-quality interactive image segmentation and matting with minimal extra parameters. Our Multi-View Localization Encoder (MVLE) captures detailed features from local views, while the Localization Adapter (Local-Adapter) refines mask outputs by recovering subtle boundary details. We also incorporate two prediction heads for each task into the architecture to generate segmentation and matting masks, simultaneously. Trained on a diverse dataset aggregated from publicly available sources, SAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple segmentation and matting benchmarks, showcasing its adaptability and effectiveness in a wide range of downstream tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12147v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Many Hands Make Light Work: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Detecting Malicious PyPI Packages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12148</link><description>arXiv:2601.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malicious code in open-source repositories such as PyPI poses a growing threat to software supply chains. Traditional rule-based tools often overlook the semantic patterns in source code that are crucial for identifying adversarial components. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for software analysis, yet their use in interpretable and modular security pipelines remains limited. This paper presents LAMPS, a multi-agent system that employs collaborative LLMs to detect malicious PyPI packages. The system consists of four role-specific agents for package retrieval, file extraction, classification, and verdict aggregation, coordinated through the CrewAI framework. A prototype combines a fine-tuned CodeBERT model for classification with LLaMA-3 agents for contextual reasoning. LAMPS has been evaluated on two complementary datasets: D1, a balanced collection of 6,000 setup.py files, and D2, a realistic multi-file dataset with 1,296 files and natural class imbalance. On D1, LAMPS achieves 97.7% accuracy, surpassing MPHunter--one of the state-of-the-art approaches. On D2, it reaches 99.5% accuracy and 99.5% balanced accuracy, outperforming RAG-based approaches and fine-tuned single-agent baselines. McNemar's test confirmed these improvements as highly significant. The results demonstrate the feasibility of distributed LLM reasoning for malicious code detection and highlight the benefits of modular multi-agent designs in software supply chain security.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12148v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Principal Component Analysis-Based Terahertz Self-Supervised Denoising and Deblurring Deep Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12149</link><description>arXiv:2601.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) systems inherently introduce frequency-dependent degradation effects, resulting in low-frequency blurring and high-frequency noise in amplitude images. Conventional image processing techniques cannot simultaneously address both issues, and manual intervention is often required due to the unknown boundary between denoising and deblurring. To tackle this challenge, we propose a principal component analysis (PCA)-based THz self-supervised denoising and deblurring network (THz-SSDD). The network employs a Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted self-supervised learning strategy to capture the intrinsic features of noise by exploiting invariance under repeated corruption. PCA decomposition and reconstruction are then applied to restore images across both low and high frequencies. The performance of the THz-SSDD network was evaluated on four types of samples. Training requires only a small set of unlabeled noisy images, and testing across samples with different material properties and measurement modes demonstrates effective denoising and deblurring. Quantitative analysis further validates the network feasibility, showing improvements in image quality while preserving the physical characteristics of the original signals.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12149v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enhanced Diagnostic Performance via Large-Resolution Inference Optimization for Pathology Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12150</link><description>arXiv:2601.12150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their prominent performance on tasks such as ROI classification and segmentation, many pathology foundation models remain constrained by a specific input size e.g. 224 x 224, creating substantial inefficiencies when applied to whole-slide images (WSIs), which span thousands of resolutions. A naive strategy is to either enlarge inputs or downsample the WSIs. However, enlarging inputs results in prohibitive GPU memory consumption, while downsampling alters the microns-per-pixel resolution and obscures critical morphological details. To overcome these limitations, we propose an space- and time- efficient inference strategy that sparsifies attention using spatially aware neighboring blocks and filters out non-informative tokens through global attention scores. This design substantially reduces GPU memory and runtime during high-resolution WSI inference while preserving and even improving the downstream performance, enabling inference at higher resolutions under the same GPU budget. The experimental results show that our method can achieves up to an 7.67% improvement in the ROI classification and compatible results in segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Who Owns Creativity and Who Does the Work?

Abstract: LLM-based agents offer new potential to accelerate science and reshape research work. However, the quality of researcher contributions can vary significantly depending on human ability to steer agent behaviors. How can we best use these tools to augment scientific creativity without undermining aspects of contribution and ownership that drive research? To investigate this, we developed an agentic research ideation system integrating three roles -- Ideator, Writer, and Evaluator -- across three control levels -- Low, Medium, and Intensive. Our mixed-methods study with 54 researchers suggests three key findings in how LLM-based agents reshape scientific creativity: 1) perceived creativity support does not simply increase linearly with greater control; 2) human effort shifts from ideating to verifying ideas; and 3) ownership becomes a negotiated outcome between human and AI. Our findings suggest that LLM agent design should emphasize researcher empowerment, fostering a sense of ownership over strong ideas rather than reducing researchers to operating an automated AI-driven process.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12152v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Analyzing Cancer Patients' Experiences with Embedding-based Topic Modeling and LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12154</link><description>arXiv:2601.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of neural topic modeling and LLMs to uncover meaningful themes from patient storytelling data, to offer insights that could contribute to more patient-oriented healthcare practices. We analyze a collection of transcribed interviews with cancer patients (132,722 words in 13 interviews). We first evaluate BERTopic and Top2Vec for individual interview summarization by using similar preprocessing, chunking, and clustering configurations to ensure a fair comparison on Keyword Extraction. LLMs (GPT4) are then used for the next step topic labeling. Their outputs for a single interview (I0) are rated through a small-scale human evaluation, focusing on {coherence}, {clarity}, and {relevance}. Based on the preliminary results and evaluation, BERTopic shows stronger performance and is selected for further experimentation using three {clinically oriented embedding} models. We then analyzed the full interview collection with the best model setting. Results show that domain-specific embeddings improved topic \textit{precision} and \textit{interpretability}, with BioClinicalBERT producing the most consistent results across transcripts. The global analysis of the full dataset of 13 interviews, using the BioClinicalBERT embedding model, reveals the most dominant topics throughout all 13 interviews, namely ``Coordination and Communication in Cancer Care Management" and ``Patient Decision-Making in Cancer Treatment Journey''. Although the interviews are machine translations from Dutch to English, and clinical professionals are not involved in this evaluation, the findings suggest that neural topic modeling, particularly BERTopic, can help provide useful feedback to clinicians from patient interviews. This pipeline could support more efficient document navigation and strengthen the role of patients' voices in healthcare workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12154v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Inverse Rendering for High-Genus 3D Surface Meshes from Multi-view Images with Persistent Homology Priors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12155</link><description>arXiv:2601.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from images is inherently an ill-posed problem due to ambiguities in geometry, appearance, and topology. This paper introduces collaborative inverse rendering with persistent homology priors, a novel strategy that leverages topological constraints to resolve these ambiguities. By incorporating priors that capture critical features such as tunnel loops and handle loops, our approach directly addresses the difficulty of reconstructing high-genus surfaces. The collaboration between photometric consistency from multi-view images and homology-based guidance enables recovery of complex high-genus geometry while circumventing catastrophic failures such as collapsing tunnels or losing high-genus structure. Instead of neural networks, our method relies on gradient-based optimization within a mesh-based inverse rendering framework to highlight the role of topological priors. Experimental results show that incorporating persistent homology priors leads to lower Chamfer Distance (CD) and higher Volume IoU compared to state-of-the-art mesh-based methods, demonstrating improved geometric accuracy and robustness against topological failure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12155v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Biological Intuition on Digital Hardware: An RTL Implementation of Poisson-Encoded SNNs for Static Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12156</link><description>arXiv:2601.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence on edge devices (TinyML) is often constrained by the high power consumption and latency associated with traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their reliance on intensive Matrix-Multiply (MAC) operations. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative by mimicking biological efficiency through event-driven processing. This paper presents the design and implementation of a cycle-accurate, hardware-oriented Spiking Neural Network (SNN) core implemented in SystemVerilog. Unlike conventional accelerators, this design utilizes a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model powered by fixed-point arithmetic and bit-wise primitives (shifts and additions) to eliminate the need for complex floating-point hardware. The architecture features an on-chip Poisson encoder for stochastic spike generation and a novel active pruning mechanism that dynamically disables neurons post-classification to minimize dynamic power consumption. We demonstrate the hardware's efficacy through a fully connected layer implementation targeting digit classification. Simulation results indicate that the design achieves rapid convergence (89% accuracy) within limited timesteps while maintaining a significantly reduced computational footprint compared to traditional dense architectures. This work serves as a foundational building block for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware on FPGA and ASIC platforms.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Language You Ask In: Language-Conditioned Ideological Divergence in LLM Analysis of Contested Political Documents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12164</link><description>arXiv:2601.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as analytical tools across multilingual contexts, yet their outputs may carry systematic biases conditioned by the language of the prompt. This study presents an experimental comparison of LLM-generated political analyses of a Ukrainian civil society document, using semantically equivalent prompts in Russian and Ukrainian. Despite identical source material and parallel query structures, the resulting analyses varied substantially in rhetorical positioning, ideological orientation, and interpretive conclusions. The Russian-language output echoed narratives common in Russian state discourse, characterizing civil society actors as illegitimate elites undermining democratic mandates. The Ukrainian-language output adopted vocabulary characteristic of Western liberal-democratic political science, treating the same actors as legitimate stakeholders within democratic contestation. These findings demonstrate that prompt language alone can produce systematically different ideological orientations from identical models analyzing identical content, with significant implications for AI deployment in polarized information environments, cross-lingual research applications, and the governance of AI systems in multilingual societies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12164v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Legged MPC with Smooth Neural Surrogates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12169</link><description>arXiv:2601.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning and model predictive control (MPC) can play complementary roles in legged robotics. However, integrating learned models with online planning remains challenging. When dynamics are learned with neural networks, three key difficulties arise: (1) stiff transitions from contact events may be inherited from the data; (2) additional non-physical local nonsmoothness can occur; and (3) training datasets can induce non-Gaussian model errors due to rapid state changes. We address (1) and (2) by introducing the smooth neural surrogate, a neural network with tunable smoothness designed to provide informative predictions and derivatives for trajectory optimization through contact. To address (3), we train these models using a heavy-tailed likelihood that better matches the empirical error distributions observed in legged-robot dynamics. Together, these design choices substantially improve the reliability, scalability, and generalizability of learned legged MPC. Across zero-shot locomotion tasks of increasing difficulty, smooth neural surrogates with robust learning yield consistent reductions in cumulative cost on simple, well-conditioned behaviors (typically 10-50%), while providing substantially larger gains in regimes where standard neural dynamics often fail outright. In these regimes, smoothing enables reliable execution (from 0/5 to 5/5 success) and produces about 2-50x lower cumulative cost, reflecting orders-of-magnitude absolute improvements in robustness rather than incremental performance gains.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12169v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Learning for the Design of Parametric Insurance Indices under Heterogeneous Renewable Production Losses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12178</link><description>arXiv:2601.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a federated learning framework for the calibration of parametric insurance indices under heterogeneous renewable energy production losses.

The approach accommodates heterogeneity in variance and link functions and directly minimizes a global deviance objective in a distributed setting. We implement and compare FedAvg, FedProx and FedOpt, and benchmark them against an existing approximation-based aggregation method. An empirical application to solar power production in Germany shows that federated learning recovers comparable index coefficients under moderate heterogeneity, while providing a more general and scalable framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12178v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Tolerance Principle and Small Language Model Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12179</link><description>arXiv:2601.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern language models like GPT-3, BERT, and LLaMA require massive training data, yet with sufficient training they reliably learn to distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences. Children aged as young as 14 months already have the capacity to learn abstract grammar rules from very few exemplars, even in the presence of non-rule-following exceptions. Yang's (2016) Tolerance Principle defines a precise threshold for how many exceptions a rule can tolerate and still be learnable. The present study explored the minimal amount and quality of training data necessary for rules to be generalized by a transformer-based language model to test the predictions of the Tolerance Principle. We trained BabyBERTa (Huebner et al. 2021), a transformer model optimized for small datasets, on artificial grammars. The training sets varied in size, number of unique sentence types, and proportion of rule-following versus exception exemplars. We found that, unlike human infants, BabyBERTa's learning dynamics do not align with the Tolerance Principle.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12179v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VidTune: Creating Video Soundtracks with Generative Music and Contextual Thumbnails</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12180</link><description>arXiv:2601.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music shapes the tone of videos, yet creators often struggle to find soundtracks that match their video's mood and narrative.

We present VidTune, a system that supports soundtrack creation by generating diverse music options from a creator's prompt and producing contextual thumbnails for rapid review. VidTune extracts representative video subjects to ground thumbnails in context, maps each track's valence and energy onto visual cues like color and brightness, and depicts prominent genres and instruments. Creators can refine tracks through natural language edits, which VidTune expands into new generations. In a controlled user study (N=12) and an exploratory case study (N=6), participants found VidTune helpful for efficiently reviewing and comparing music options and described the process as playful and enriching.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12180v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Negotiating Digital Identities with AI Companions: Motivations, Strategies, and Emotional Outcomes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12181</link><description>arXiv:2601.12181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI companions enable deep emotional relationships by engaging a user's sense of identity, but they also pose risks like unhealthy emotional dependence. Mitigating these risks requires first understanding the underlying process of identity construction and negotiation with AI companions. Focusing on Character.AI (C.AI), a popular AI companion, we conducted an LLM-assisted thematic analysis of 22,374 online discussions on its subreddit. Using Identity Negotiation Theory as an analytical lens, we identified a three-stage process: 1) five user motivations; 2) an identity negotiation process involving three communication expectations and four identity co-construction strategies; and 3) three emotional outcomes. Our findings surface the identity work users perform as both performers and directors to co-construct identities in negotiation with C.AI. This process takes place within a socio-emotional sandbox where users can experiment with social roles and express emotions without non-human partners. Finally, we offer design implications for emotionally supporting users while mitigating the risks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Aletheia: What Makes RLVR For Code Verifiers Tick?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12186</link><description>arXiv:2601.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-domain thinking verifiers trained via Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are a prominent fixture of the Large Language Model (LLM) post-training pipeline, owing to their ability to robustly rate and rerank model outputs. However, the adoption of such verifiers towards code generation has been comparatively sparse, with execution feedback constituting the dominant signal. Nonetheless, code verifiers remain valuable toward judging model outputs in scenarios where execution feedback is hard to obtain and are a potentially powerful addition to the code generation post-training toolbox. To this end, we create and open-source Aletheia, a controlled testbed that enables execution-grounded evaluation of code verifiers' robustness across disparate policy models and covariate shifts. We examine components of the RLVR-based verifier training recipe widely credited for its success: (1) intermediate thinking traces, (2) learning from negative samples, and (3) on-policy training. While experiments show the optimality of RLVR, we uncover important opportunities to simplify the recipe. Particularly, despite code verification exhibiting positive training- and inference-time scaling, on-policy learning stands out as the key component at small verifier sizes, and thinking-based training emerges as the most important component at larger scales.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VIRTUE: Versatile Video Retrieval Through Unified Embeddings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12193</link><description>arXiv:2601.12193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern video retrieval systems are expected to handle diverse tasks ranging from corpus-level retrieval and fine-grained moment localization to flexible multimodal querying. Specialized architectures achieve strong retrieval performance by training modality-specific encoders on massive datasets, but they lack the ability to process composed multimodal queries. In contrast, multimodal LLM (MLLM)-based methods support rich multimodal search but their retrieval performance remains well below that of specialized systems. We present VIRTUE, an MLLM-based versatile video retrieval framework that integrates corpus and moment-level retrieval capabilities while accommodating composed multimodal queries within a single architecture. We use contrastive alignment of visual and textual embeddings generated using a shared MLLM backbone to facilitate efficient embedding-based candidate search. Our embedding model, trained efficiently using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on 700K paired visual-text data samples, surpasses other MLLM-based methods on zero-shot video retrieval tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same model can be adapted without further training to achieve competitive results on zero-shot moment retrieval, and state of the art results for zero-shot composed video retrieval. With additional training for reranking candidates identified in the embedding-based search, our model substantially outperforms existing MLLM-based retrieval systems and achieves retrieval performance comparable to state of the art specialized models which are trained on orders of magnitude larger data.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12193v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Coherent Comparison as Information Cost: A Cost-First Ledger Framework for Discrete Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12194</link><description>arXiv:2601.12194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an information-theoretic framework for discrete dynamics grounded in a comparison-cost functional on ratios. Given two quantities compared via their ratio \(x=a/b\), we assign a cost \(F(x)\) measuring deviation from equilibrium (\(x=1\)). Requiring coherent composition under multiplicative chaining imposes a d'Alembert functional equation; together with normalization (\(F(1)=0\)) and quadratic calibration at unity, this yields a unique reciprocal cost functional (proved in a companion paper): \[ J(x) = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(x + x^{-1}\bigr) - 1. \] This cost exhibits reciprocity \(J(x)=J(x^{-1})\), vanishes only at \(x=1\), and diverges at boundary regimes \(x\to 0^+\) and \(x\to\infty\), excluding ``nothingness'' configurations. Using \(J\) as input, we introduce a discrete ledger as a minimal lossless encoding of recognition events on directed graphs. Under deterministic update semantics and minimality (no intra-tick ordering metadata), we derive atomic ticks (at most one event per tick). Explicit structural assumptions (conservation, no sources/sinks, pairwise locality, quantization in \(\delta\mathbb{Z}\)) force balanced double-entry postings and discrete ledger units. To obtain scalar potentials on graphs with cycles while retaining single-edge impulses per tick, we impose time-aggregated cycle closure (no-arbitrage/clearing over finite windows). Under this hypothesis, cycle closure is equivalent to path-independence, and the cleared cumulative flow admits a unique scalar potential on each connected component (up to additive constant), via a discrete Poincar\'e lemma. On hypercube graphs \(Q_d\), atomicity imposes a \(2^d\)-tick minimal period, with explicit Gray-code realization at \(d=3\). The framework connects ratio-based divergences, conservative graph flows, and discrete potential theory through a coherence-forced cost structure.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12194v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Understanding Partial Reachability in the Internet Core</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12196</link><description>arXiv:2601.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing strives to connect all the Internet, but compete: political pressure threatens routing fragmentation; architectural changes such as private clouds, carrier-grade NAT, and firewalls make connectivity conditional; and commercial disputes create partial reachability for days or years. This paper suggests *persistent, partial reachability is fundamental to the Internet* and an underexplored problem. We first *derive a conceptual definition of the Internet core* based on connectivity, not authority. We identify *peninsulas*: persistent, partial connectivity; and *islands*: when computers are partitioned from the Internet core. Second, we develop algorithms to observe each across the Internet, and apply them to two existing measurement systems: Trinocular, where 6 locations observe 5M networks frequently, and RIPE Atlas, where 13k locations scan the DNS roots frequently. Cross-validation shows our findings are stable over *three years of data*, and consistent with as few as 3 geographically-distributed observers. We validate peninsulas and islands against CAIDA Ark, showing good recall (0.94) and bounding precision between 0.42 and 0.82. Finally, our work has broad practical impact: we show that *peninsulas are more common than Internet outages*. Factoring out peninsulas and islands as noise can *improve existing measurement systems*; their ``noise'' is $5\times$ to $9.7\times$ larger than the operational events in RIPE's DNSmon. We show that most peninsula events are routing transients (45\%), but most peninsula-time (90\%) is due to a few (7\%) long-lived events. Our work helps inform Internet policy and governance, with our neutral definition showing no single country or organization can unilaterally control the Internet core.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Embryonic Exposure to VPA Influences Chick Vocalisations: A Computational Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12203</link><description>arXiv:2601.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In young animals like poultry chicks (Gallus gallus), vocalisations convey information about affective and behavioural states. Traditional approaches to vocalisation analysis, relying on manual annotation and predefined categories, introduce biases, limit scalability, and fail to capture the full complexity of vocal repertoires. We introduce a computational framework for the automated detection, acoustic feature extraction, and unsupervised learning of chick vocalisations. Applying this framework to a dataset of newly hatched chicks, we identified two primary vocal clusters. We then tested our computational framework on an independent dataset of chicks exposed during embryonic development to vehicle or Valproic Acid (VPA), a compound that disrupts neural development and is linked to autistic-like symptoms. Clustering analysis on the experimental dataset confirmed two primary vocal clusters and revealed systematic differences between groups. VPA-exposed chicks showed an altered repertoire, with a relative increase in softer calls. VPA differentially affected call clusters, modulating temporal, frequency, and energy domain features. Overall, VPA-exposed chicks produced vocalisations with shorter duration, reduced pitch variability, and modified energy profiles, with the strongest alterations observed in louder calls. This study provides a computational framework for analysing animal vocalisations, advancing knowledge of early-life communication in typical and atypical vocal development.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12203v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Do Neural Codecs Generalize?

Abstract: This paper investigates three crucial yet underexplored aspects of the generalization capabilities of neural audio codecs (NACs): (i) whether NACs can generalize to unseen languages during pre-training, (ii) whether speech-only pre-trained NACs can effectively generalize to non-speech applications such as environmental sounds, music, and animal vocalizations, and (iii) whether incorporating non-speech data during pre-training can improve performance on both speech and non-speech tasks. Existing studies typically rely on off-the-shelf NACs for comparison, which limits insight due to variations in implementation. In this work, we train NACs from scratch using strictly controlled configurations and carefully curated pre-training data to enable fair comparisons. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of NAC performance on both signal reconstruction quality and downstream applications using 11 metrics. Our results show that NACs can generalize to unseen languages during pre-training, speech-only pre-trained NACs exhibit degraded performance on non-speech tasks, and incorporating non-speech data during pre-training improves performance on non-speech tasks while maintaining comparable performance on speech tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12205v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CoReflect: Conversational Evaluation via Co-Evolutionary Simulation and Reflective Rubric Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12208</link><description>arXiv:2601.12208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating conversational systems in multi-turn settings remains a fundamental challenge. Conventional pipelines typically rely on manually defined rubrics and fixed conversational context$-$a static approach that limits coverage and fails to capture the diverse, emergent behaviors of dialogue models. To address this, we introduce CoReflect (Conversational Evaluation via Co-Evolutionary Simulation and Reflective Rubric Refinement), which unifies dialogue simulation and evaluation into an adaptive, iterative process. CoReflect employs a conversation planner that generates structured templates to guide a user simulator through diverse, goal-directed dialogues. Subsequently, a reflective analyzer processes these dialogues to identify systematic behavioral patterns and automatically refine the evaluation rubrics. Crucially, the insights from the conversation analysis are fed back into the planner to update conversation templates for subsequent iterations. This co-evolution loop ensures that the complexity of test cases and the diagnostic precision of rubrics improve in tandem. By minimizing human intervention, CoReflect provides a scalable and self-refining methodology that allows evaluation protocols to adapt alongside the rapidly advancing capabilities of dialogue models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12208v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DaggerFFT: A Distributed FFT Framework Using Task Scheduling in Julia</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12209</link><description>arXiv:2601.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a fundamental numerical technique with widespread application in a range of scientific problems. As scientific simulations attempt to exploit exascale systems, there has been a growing demand for distributed FFT algorithms that can effectively utilize modern heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Conventional FFT algorithms commonly encounter performance bottlenecks, especially when run on heterogeneous platforms. Most distributed FFT approaches rely on static task distribution and require synchronization barriers, limiting scalability and impacting overall resource utilization. In this paper we present DaggerFFT, a distributed FFT framework, developed in Julia, that treats highly parallel FFT computations as a dynamically scheduled task graph. Each FFT stage operates on a separately defined distributed array. FFT operations are expressed as DTasks operating on pencil or slab partitioned DArrays. Each FFT stage owns its own DArray, and the runtime assigns DTasks across devices using Dagger's dynamic scheduler that uses work stealing. We demonstrate how DaggerFFT's dynamic scheduler can outperform state-of-the-art distributed FFT libraries on both CPU and GPU backends, achieving up to a 2.6x speedup on CPU clusters and up to a 1.35x speedup on GPU clusters. We have integrated DaggerFFT into Oceananigans.jl, a geophysical fluid dynamics framework, demonstrating that high-level, task-based runtimes can deliver both superior performance and modularity in large-scale, real-world simulations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12209v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Solvability of The Output Corridor Control Problem by Pulse-Modulated Feedback</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12210</link><description>arXiv:2601.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of maintaining the output of a positive time-invariant single-input single-output system within a predefined corridor of values is treated. For third-order plants possessing a certain structure, it is proven that the problem is always solvable under stationary conditions by means of pulse-modulated feedback. The obtained result is utilized to assess the feasibility of patient-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models with respect to patient safety. A population of Wiener models capturing the dynamics of a neuromuscular blockade agent is studied to investigate whether or not they can be driven into the desired output corridor by clinically acceptable sequential drug doses (boluses). It is demonstrated that low values of a parameter in the nonlinear pharmacodynamic part lie behind the detected model infeasibility.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12210v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Speculative Sampling with Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12212</link><description>arXiv:2601.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference time latency has remained an open challenge for real world applications of large language models (LLMs). State-of-the-art (SOTA) speculative sampling (SpS) methods for LLMs, like EAGLE-3, use tree-based drafting to explore multiple candidate continuations in parallel. However, the hyperparameters controlling the tree structure are static, which limits flexibility and efficiency across diverse contexts and domains. We introduce Reinforcement learning for Speculative Sampling (Re-SpS), the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for draft tree hyperparameter optimization. Re-SpS dynamically adjusts draft tree hyperparameters in real-time, learning context-aware policies that maximize generation speed by balancing speculative aggression with computational overhead. It leverages efficient state representations from target model hidden states and introduces multi-step action persistence for better context modeling. Evaluation results across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the SOTA method EAGLE-3, achieving up to 5.45$\times$ speedup over the backbone LLM and up to 1.12$\times$ speedup compared to EAGLE-3 across five diverse benchmarks, with no loss in output fidelity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12212v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] One-Sided Matrix Completion from Ultra-Sparse Samples</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12213</link><description>arXiv:2601.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix completion is a classical problem that has received recurring interest across a wide range of fields. In this paper, we revisit this problem in an ultra-sparse sampling regime, where each entry of an unknown, $n\times d$ matrix $M$ (with $n \ge d$) is observed independently with probability $p = C / d$, for a fixed integer $C \ge 2$. This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\top} M / n$.
  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \ge O({d r^5 \epsilon^{-2} C^{-2} \log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $\epsilon^2$.
  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach. On three MovieLens datasets, our algorithm reduces bias by $88\%$ relative to baseline estimators. We also empirically validate the linear sampling complexity of $n$ relative to $d$ on synthetic data. On an Amazon reviews dataset with sparsity $10^{-7}$, our method reduces the recovery error of $T$ by $59\%$ and $M$ by $38\%$ compared to baseline methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12213v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wavelet-Driven Masked Multiscale Reconstruction for PPG Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12215</link><description>arXiv:2601.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable foundation models have the potential to transform digital health by learning transferable representations from large-scale biosignals collected in everyday settings. While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features. Together, these results highlight the potential of MMR as a step toward generalizable PPG foundation models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12215v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Canonicalization of Batched Einstein Summations for Tuning Retrieval</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12220</link><description>arXiv:2601.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for normalizing \emph{Batched Einstein Summation}
  expressions by mapping mathematically equivalent formulations to a unique
  normal form. Batches of einsums with the same Einstein notation that exhibit
  substantial data reuse appear frequently in finite element methods (FEM),
  numerical linear algebra, and computational chemistry. To effectively exploit
  this temporal locality for high performance, we consider groups of einsums in
  batched form.
  Representations of equivalent batched einsums may differ due to index
  renaming, permutations within the batch, and, due to the commutativity and
  associativity of multiplication operation. The lack of a canonical
  representation hinders the reuse of optimization and tuning knowledge in
  software systems. To this end, we develop a novel encoding of batched einsums
  as colored graphs and apply graph canonicalization to derive a normal form.
  In addition to the canonicalization algorithm, we propose a representation of
  einsums using functional array operands and provide a strategy to transfer
  transformations operating on the normal form to \emph{functional batched
  einsums} that exhibit the same normal form; crucial for fusing surrounding
  computations for memory bound einsums. We evaluate our approach against JAX,
  and observe a geomean speedup of $4.7\times$ for einsums from the TCCG
  benchmark suite and an FEM solver.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12220v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Song Aesthetics Evaluation with Multi-Stem Attention and Hierarchical Uncertainty Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12222</link><description>arXiv:2601.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding music content, necessitating automated song aesthetics evaluation. However, existing studies largely focus on speech, audio or singing quality, leaving song aesthetics underexplored. Moreover, conventional approaches often predict a precise Mean Opinion Score (MOS) value directly, which struggles to capture the nuances of human perception in song aesthetics evaluation. This paper proposes a song-oriented aesthetics evaluation framework, featuring two novel modules: 1) Multi-Stem Attention Fusion (MSAF) builds bidirectional cross-attention between mixture-vocal and mixture-accompaniment pairs, fusing them to capture complex musical features; 2) Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Interval Aggregation (HiGIA) learns multi-granularity score probability distributions, aggregates them into a score interval, and applies a regression within the interval to produce the final score. We evaluated on two datasets of full-length songs: SongEval dataset (AI-generated) and an internal aesthetics dataset (human-created), and compared with two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the proposed method achieves stronger performance for multi-dimensional song aesthetics evaluation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12222v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Where It Moves, It Matters: Referring Surgical Instrument Segmentation via Motion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12224</link><description>arXiv:2601.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling intuitive, language-driven interaction with surgical scenes is a critical step toward intelligent operating rooms and autonomous surgical robotic assistance. However, the task of referring segmentation, localizing surgical instruments based on natural language descriptions, remains underexplored in surgical videos, with existing approaches struggling to generalize due to reliance on static visual cues and predefined instrument names. In this work, we introduce SurgRef, a novel motion-guided framework that grounds free-form language expressions in instrument motion, capturing how tools move and interact across time, rather than what they look like. This allows models to understand and segment instruments even under occlusion, ambiguity, or unfamiliar terminology. To train and evaluate SurgRef, we present Ref-IMotion, a diverse, multi-institutional video dataset with dense spatiotemporal masks and rich motion-centric expressions. SurgRef achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and generalization across surgical procedures, setting a new benchmark for robust, language-driven surgical video segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12224v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Longitudinal Health Representations from EHR and Wearable Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12227</link><description>arXiv:2601.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models trained on electronic health records show strong performance on many clinical prediction tasks but are limited by sparse and irregular documentation. Wearable devices provide dense continuous physiological signals but lack semantic grounding. Existing methods usually model these data sources separately or combine them through late fusion. We propose a multimodal foundation model that jointly represents electronic health records and wearable data as a continuous time latent process. The model uses modality specific encoders and a shared temporal backbone pretrained with self supervised and cross modal objectives. This design produces representations that are temporally coherent and clinically grounded. Across forecasting physiological and risk modeling tasks the model outperforms strong electronic health record only and wearable only baselines especially at long horizons and under missing data. These results show that joint electronic health record and wearable pretraining yields more faithful representations of longitudinal health.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12227v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Wavelet-Aware Anomaly Detection in Multi-Channel User Logs via Deviation Modulation and Resolution-Adaptive Attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12231</link><description>arXiv:2601.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insider threat detection is a key challenge in enterprise security, relying on user activity logs that capture rich and complex behavioral patterns. These logs are often multi-channel, non-stationary, and anomalies are rare, making anomaly detection challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates wavelet-aware modulation, multi-resolution wavelet decomposition, and resolution-adaptive attention for robust anomaly detection. Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies. Finally, a learnable attention mechanism dynamically reweights the most discriminative frequency bands for detection. On the CERT r4.2 benchmark, our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in precision, recall, and F1 score across various time granularities and scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DiffusionQC: Artifact Detection in Histopathology via Diffusion Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12233</link><description>arXiv:2601.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital pathology plays a vital role across modern medicine, offering critical insights for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. However, histopathology images often contain artifacts introduced during slide preparation and digitization. Detecting and excluding them is essential to ensure reliable downstream analysis. Traditional supervised models typically require large annotated datasets, which is resource-intensive and not generalizable to novel artifact types. To address this, we propose DiffusionQC, which detects artifacts as outliers among clean images using a diffusion model. It requires only a set of clean images for training rather than pixel-level artifact annotations and predefined artifact types. Furthermore, we introduce a contrastive learning module to explicitly enlarge the distribution separation between artifact and clean images, yielding an enhanced version of our method. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance to state-of-the-art and offer cross-stain generalization capacity, with significantly less data and annotations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12233v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Proc3D: Procedural 3D Generation and Parametric Editing of 3D Shapes with Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12234</link><description>arXiv:2601.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating 3D models has traditionally been a complex task requiring specialized expertise. While recent advances in generative AI have sought to automate this process, existing methods produce non-editable representation, such as meshes or point clouds, limiting their adaptability for iterative design. In this paper, we introduce Proc3D, a system designed to generate editable 3D models while enabling real-time modifications. At its core, Proc3D introduces procedural compact graph (PCG), a graph representation of 3D models, that encodes the algorithmic rules and structures necessary for generating the model. This representation exposes key parameters, allowing intuitive manual adjustments via sliders and checkboxes, as well as real-time, automated modifications through natural language prompts using Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate Proc3D's capabilities using two generative approaches: GPT-4o with in-context learning (ICL) and a fine-tuned LLAMA-3 model. Experimental results show that Proc3D outperforms existing methods in editing efficiency, achieving more than 400x speedup over conventional approaches that require full regeneration for each modification. Additionally, Proc3D improves ULIP scores by 28%, a metric that evaluates the alignment between generated 3D models and text prompts. By enabling text-aligned 3D model generation along with precise, real-time parametric edits, Proc3D facilitates highly accurate text-based image editing applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12234v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Power Aware Dynamic Reallocation For Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12241</link><description>arXiv:2601.12241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disaggregation has emerged as a powerful strategy for optimizing large language model (LLM) inference by separating compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases across specialized GPUs. This separation improves utilization and throughput under fixed hardware capacity. However, as model and cluster scales grow, power, rather than compute, has become the dominant limiter of overall performance and cost efficiency. In this paper, we propose RAPID, a power-aware disaggregated inference framework that jointly manages GPU roles and power budgets to sustain goodput within strict power caps. RAPID utilizes static and dynamic power reallocation in addition to GPU reallocation to improve performance under fixed power bounds. RAPID improves overall performance and application consistency beyond what is achievable in current disaggregation solutions, resulting in up to a 2x improvement in SLO attainment at peak load when compared to a static assignment without an increase in complexity or cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12241v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Optimal Power Allocation and Sub-Optimal Channel Assignment for Downlink NOMA Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12242</link><description>arXiv:2601.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) system has emerged as a promising candidate for multiple access frameworks due to the evolution of deep machine learning, trying to incorporate deep machine learning into the NOMA system. The main motivation for such active studies is the growing need to optimize the utilization of network resources as the expansion of the internet of things (IoT) caused a scarcity of network resources. The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL). Despite this, the channel assignment problem remains unclear and requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework incorporating replay memory with an on-policy algorithm, allocating network resources in a NOMA system to generalize the learning. Also, we provide extensive simulations to evaluate the effects of varying the learning rate, batch size, type of model, and the number of features in the state.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12242v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Less is More: Label-Guided Summarization of Procedural and Instructional Videos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12243</link><description>arXiv:2601.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video summarization helps turn long videos into clear, concise representations that are easier to review, document, and analyze, especially in high-stakes domains like surgical training. Prior work has progressed from using basic visual features like color, motion, and structural changes to using pre-trained vision-language models that can better understand what's happening in the video (semantics) and capture temporal flow, resulting in more context-aware video summarization. We propose a three-stage framework, PRISM: Procedural Representation via Integrated Semantic and Multimodal analysis, that produces semantically grounded video summaries. PRISM combines adaptive visual sampling, label-driven keyframe anchoring, and contextual validation using a large language model (LLM). Our method ensures that selected frames reflect meaningful and procedural transitions while filtering out generic or hallucinated content, resulting in contextually coherent summaries across both domain-specific and instructional videos. We evaluate our method on instructional and activity datasets, using reference summaries for instructional videos. Despite sampling fewer than 5% of the original frames, our summaries retain 84% semantic content while improving over baselines by as much as 33%. Our approach generalizes across procedural and domain-specific video tasks, achieving strong performance with both semantic alignment and precision.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12243v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Comprehensive Review of Bio-Inspired Approaches to Coordination, Communication, and System Architecture in Underwater Swarm Robotics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12244</link><description>arXiv:2601.12244v1 Announce Type: new

Yet research in this field remains fragmented, with limited integration across algorithmic, communication, and hardware design perspectives. This review synthesises bio-inspired coordination mechanisms, communication strategies, and system design considerations for underwater swarm robotics. It examines key marine-specific algorithms, including the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm, Whale Optimisation Algorithm, Coral Reef Optimisation, and Marine Predators Algorithm, highlighting their applications in formation control, task allocation, and environmental interaction. The review also analyses communication constraints unique to the underwater domain and emerging acoustic, optical, and hybrid solutions that support cooperative operation. Additionally, it examines hardware and system design advances that enhance system efficiency and scalability. A multi-dimensional classification framework evaluates existing approaches across communication dependency, environmental adaptability, energy efficiency, and swarm scalability. Through this integrated analysis, the review unifies bio-inspired coordination algorithms, communication modalities, and system design approaches. It also identifies converging trends, key challenges, and future research directions for real-world deployment of underwater swarm systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12244v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Sound2Hap: Learning Audio-to-Vibrotactile Haptic Generation from Human Ratings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12245</link><description>arXiv:2601.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental sounds like footsteps, keyboard typing, or dog barking carry rich information and emotional context, making them valuable for designing haptics in user applications. Existing audio-to-vibration methods, however, rely on signal-processing rules tuned for music or games and often fail to generalize across diverse sounds. To address this, we first investigated user perception of four existing audio-to-haptic algorithms, then created a data-driven model for environmental sounds. In Study 1, 34 participants rated vibrations generated by the four algorithms for 1,000 sounds, revealing no consistent algorithm preferences. Using this dataset, we trained Sound2Hap, a CNN-based autoencoder, to generate perceptually meaningful vibrations from diverse sounds with low latency. In Study 2, 15 participants rated its output higher than signal-processing baselines on both audio-vibration match and Haptic Experience Index (HXI), finding it more harmonious with diverse sounds. This work demonstrates a perceptually validated approach to audio-haptic translation, broadening the reach of sound-driven haptics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12245v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Explicit symmetric low-regularity integrators for the semilinear Klein-Gordon equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12246</link><description>arXiv:2601.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the design and analysis of symmetric low-regularity integrators for the semilinear Klein-Gordon equation. We first propose a general symmetrization procedure that allows for the systematic construction of symmetric schemes from existing explicit (non-symmetric) integrators. Applying this procedure, we derive two novel schemes. Error analyses show that both integrators achieve their optimal convergence orders in the energy space under significantly relaxed regularity assumptions. Furthermore, the symmetry property ensures that the convergence order of a first-order symmetric scheme improves as the regularity of the exact solution increases. A numerical experiment demonstrates that the proposed second-order symmetric scheme nearly preserves the system energy over extended periods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12246v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Plan, Verify and Fill: A Structured Parallel Decoding Approach for Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12247</link><description>arXiv:2601.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) present a promising non-sequential paradigm for text generation, distinct from standard autoregressive (AR) approaches. However, current decoding strategies often adopt a reactive stance, underutilizing the global bidirectional context to dictate global trajectories. To address this, we propose Plan-Verify-Fill (PVF), a training-free paradigm that grounds planning via quantitative validation. PVF actively constructs a hierarchical skeleton by prioritizing high-leverage semantic anchors and employs a verification protocol to operationalize pragmatic structural stopping where further deliberation yields diminishing returns. Extensive evaluations on LLaDA-8B-Instruct and Dream-7B-Instruct demonstrate that PVF reduces the Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) by up to 65% compared to confidence-based parallel decoding across benchmark datasets, unlocking superior efficiency without compromising accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12247v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Innovative Framework for Breast Cancer Detection Using Pyramid Adaptive Atrous Convolution, Transformer Integration, and Multi-Scale Feature Fusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12249</link><description>arXiv:2601.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, and its accurate and timely diagnosis plays a critical role in improving treatment outcomes. This thesis presents an innovative framework for detecting malignant masses in mammographic images by integrating the Pyramid Adaptive Atrous Convolution (PAAC) and Transformer architectures. The proposed approach utilizes Multi-Scale Feature Fusion to enhance the extraction of features from benign and malignant tissues and combines Dice Loss and Focal Loss functions to improve the model's learning process, effectively reducing errors in binary breast cancer classification and achieving high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, a comprehensive dataset of breast cancer images from INbreast, MIAS, and DDSM was preprocessed through data augmentation and contrast enhancement and resized to 227x227 pixels for model training. Leveraging the Transformer's ability to manage long-range dependencies with Self-Attention mechanisms, the proposed model achieved high accuracy in detecting cancerous masses, outperforming foundational models such as BreastNet, DeepMammo, Multi-Scale CNN, Swin-Unet, and SegFormer. The final evaluation results for the proposed model include an accuracy of 98.5\%, sensitivity of 97.8\%, specificity of 96.3\%, F1-score of 98.2\%, and overall precision of 97.9\%. These metrics demonstrate a significant improvement over traditional methods and confirm the model's effectiveness in identifying cancerous masses in complex scenarios and large datasets. This model shows potential as a reliable and efficient tool for breast cancer diagnosis and can be effectively integrated into medical diagnostic systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12249v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Breaking Coordinate Overfitting: Geometry-Aware WiFi Sensing for Cross-Layout 3D Pose Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12252</link><description>arXiv:2601.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi-based 3D human pose estimation offers a low-cost and privacy-preserving alternative to vision-based systems for smart interaction. However, existing approaches rely on visual 3D poses as supervision and directly regress CSI to a camera-based coordinate system. We find that this practice leads to coordinate overfitting: models memorize deployment-specific WiFi transceiver layouts rather than only learning activity-relevant representations, resulting in severe generalization failures. To address this challenge, we present PerceptAlign, the first geometry-conditioned framework for WiFi-based cross-layout pose estimation. PerceptAlign introduces a lightweight coordinate unification procedure that aligns WiFi and vision measurements in a shared 3D space using only two checkerboards and a few photos. Within this unified space, it encodes calibrated transceiver positions into high-dimensional embeddings and fuses them with CSI features, making the model explicitly aware of device geometry as a conditional variable. This design forces the network to disentangle human motion from deployment layouts, enabling robust and, for the first time, layout-invariant WiFi pose estimation. To support systematic evaluation, we construct the largest cross-domain 3D WiFi pose estimation dataset to date, comprising 21 subjects, 5 scenes, 18 actions, and 7 device layouts. Experiments show that PerceptAlign reduces in-domain error by 12.3% and cross-domain error by more than 60% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results establish geometry-conditioned learning as a viable path toward scalable and practical WiFi sensing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12252v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Federated Joint Learning for Domain and Class Generalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12253</link><description>arXiv:2601.12253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of visual-language models like CLIP has become crucial due to their large-scale parameter size and extensive pretraining requirements. Existing methods typically address either the issue of unseen classes or unseen domains in isolation, without considering a joint framework for both. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Fed}erated Joint Learning for \textbf{D}omain and \textbf{C}lass \textbf{G}eneralization, termed \textbf{FedDCG}, a novel approach that addresses both class and domain generalization in federated learning settings. Our method introduces a domain grouping strategy where class-generalized networks are trained within each group to prevent decision boundary confusion. During inference, we aggregate class-generalized results based on domain similarity, effectively integrating knowledge from both class and domain generalization. Specifically, a learnable network is employed to enhance class generalization capabilities, and a decoupling mechanism separates general and domain-specific knowledge, improving generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments across various datasets show that \textbf{FedDCG} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy and robustness.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12253v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Confidence-based Filtering for Speech Dataset Curation with Generative Speech Enhancement Using Discrete Tokens</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12254</link><description>arXiv:2601.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative speech enhancement (GSE) models show great promise in producing high-quality clean speech from noisy inputs, enabling applications such as curating noisy text-to-speech (TTS) datasets into high-quality ones. However, GSE models are prone to hallucination errors, such as phoneme omissions and speaker inconsistency, which conventional error filtering based on non-intrusive speech quality metrics often fails to detect. To address this issue, we propose a non-intrusive method for filtering hallucination errors from discrete token-based GSE models. Our method leverages the log-probabilities of generated tokens as confidence scores to detect potential errors. Experimental results show that the confidence scores strongly correlate with a suite of intrusive SE metrics, and that our method effectively identifies hallucination errors missed by conventional filtering methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our method: curating an in-the-wild TTS dataset with our confidence-based filtering improves the performance of subsequently trained TTS models.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12254v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Large Molecular Language Model via Relation-aware Multimodal Collaboration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12256</link><description>arXiv:2601.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their instruction-following capabilities and achieved powerful performance on various tasks. Inspired by their success, recent works in the molecular domain have led to the development of large molecular language models (LMLMs) that integrate 1D molecular strings or 2D molecular graphs into the language models. However, existing LMLMs often suffer from hallucination and limited robustness, largely due to inadequate integration of diverse molecular modalities such as 1D sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformations. To address these limitations, we propose CoLLaMo, a large language model-based molecular assistant equipped with a multi-level molecular modality-collaborative projector. The relation-aware modality-collaborative attention mechanism in the projector facilitates fine-grained and relation-guided information exchange between atoms by incorporating 2D structural and 3D spatial relations. Furthermore, we present a molecule-centric new automatic measurement, including a hallucination assessment metric and GPT-based caption quality evaluation to address the limitations of token-based generic evaluation metrics (i.e., BLEU) widely used in assessing molecular comprehension of LMLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoLLaMo enhances the molecular modality generalization capabilities of LMLMs, achieving the best performance on multiple tasks, including molecule captioning, computed property QA, descriptive property QA, motif counting, and IUPAC name prediction.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12256v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Soft Shadow Diffusion (SSD): Physics-inspired Learning for 3D Computational Periscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12257</link><description>arXiv:2601.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional imaging requires a line of sight to create accurate visual representations of a scene. In certain circumstances, however, obtaining a suitable line of sight may be impractical, dangerous, or even impossible. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses this challenge by reconstructing the scene from indirect measurements. Recently, passive NLOS methods that use an ordinary photograph of the subtle shadow cast onto a visible wall by the hidden scene have gained interest. These methods are currently limited to 1D or low-resolution 2D color imaging or to localizing a hidden object whose shape is approximately known. Here, we generalize this class of methods and demonstrate a 3D reconstruction of a hidden scene from an ordinary NLOS photograph. To achieve this, we propose a novel reformulation of the light transport model that conveniently decomposes the hidden scene into \textit{light-occluding} and \textit{non-light-occluding} components to yield a separable non-linear least squares (SNLLS) inverse problem. We develop two solutions: A gradient-based optimization method and a physics-inspired neural network approach, which we call Soft Shadow diffusion (SSD). Despite the challenging ill-conditioned inverse problem encountered here, our approaches are effective on numerous 3D scenes in real experimental scenarios. Moreover, SSD is trained in simulation but generalizes well to unseen classes in simulation and real-world NLOS scenes. SSD also shows surprising robustness to noise and ambient illumination.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12257v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] FutureX-Pro: Extending Future Prediction to High-Value Vertical Domains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12259</link><description>arXiv:2601.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon FutureX, which established a live benchmark for general-purpose future prediction, this report introduces FutureX-Pro, including FutureX-Finance, FutureX-Retail, FutureX-PublicHealth, FutureX-NaturalDisaster, and FutureX-Search. These together form a specialized framework extending agentic future prediction to high-value vertical domains. While generalist agents demonstrate proficiency in open-domain search, their reliability in capital-intensive and safety-critical sectors remains under-explored. FutureX-Pro targets four economically and socially pivotal verticals: Finance, Retail, Public Health, and Natural Disaster. We benchmark agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on entry-level yet foundational prediction tasks -- ranging from forecasting market indicators and supply chain demands to tracking epidemic trends and natural disasters. By adapting the contamination-free, live-evaluation pipeline of FutureX, we assess whether current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) agentic LLMs possess the domain grounding necessary for industrial deployment. Our findings reveal the performance gap between generalist reasoning and the precision required for high-value vertical applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12259v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Docs2Synth: A Synthetic Data Trained Retriever Framework for Scanned Visually Rich Documents Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12260</link><description>arXiv:2601.12260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document understanding (VRDU) in regulated domains is particularly challenging, since scanned documents often contain sensitive, evolving, and domain specific knowledge. This leads to two major challenges: the lack of manual annotations for model adaptation and the difficulty for pretrained models to stay up-to-date with domain-specific facts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong zero-shot abilities, they still suffer from hallucination and limited domain grounding. In contrast, discriminative Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) provide reliable grounding but require costly annotations to cover new domains. We introduce Docs2Synth, a synthetic-supervision framework that enables retrieval-guided inference for private and low-resource domains. Docs2Synth automatically processes raw document collections, generates and verifies diverse QA pairs via an agent-based system, and trains a lightweight visual retriever to extract domain-relevant evidence. During inference, the retriever collaborates with an MLLM through an iterative retrieval--generation loop, reducing hallucination and improving response consistency. We further deliver Docs2Synth as an easy-to-use Python package, enabling plug-and-play deployment across diverse real-world scenarios. Experiments on multiple VRDU benchmarks show that Docs2Synth substantially enhances grounding and domain generalization without requiring human annotations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12260v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Environment-Aware Code Generation: How far are We?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12262</link><description>arXiv:2601.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has improved code generation, but most evaluations still test isolated, small-scale code (e.g., a single function) under default or unspecified software environments. As a result, it is unclear whether LLMs can reliably generate executable code tailored to a user's specific environment. We present the first systematic study of Environment-Aware Code Generation (EACG), where generated code must be functionally correct and directly executable under arbitrary software configurations. To enable realistic evaluation, we introduce VersiBCB, a benchmark that is multi-package, execution-verified, and deprecation-aware, capturing complex and evolving environments that prior datasets often overlook. Using VersiBCB, we investigate three complementary adaptation axes: data, parameters, and cache, and develop representative strategies for each. Our results show that current LLMs struggle with environment-specific code generation, while our adaptations improve environment compatibility and executability. These findings highlight key challenges and opportunities for deploying LLMs in practical software engineering workflows.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12262v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization: Rank Manipulation for Vision-Language Model Rankers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12263</link><description>arXiv:2601.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are rapidly replacing unimodal encoders in modern retrieval and recommendation systems. While their capabilities are well-documented, their robustness against adversarial manipulation in competitive ranking scenarios remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we uncover a critical vulnerability in VLM-based product search: multimodal ranking attacks. We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes. Unlike existing attacks that treat modalities in isolation, MGEO employs an alternating gradient-based optimization strategy to exploit the deep cross-modal coupling within the VLM. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets using state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our coordinated attack significantly outperforms text-only and image-only baselines. These findings reveal that multimodal synergy, typically a strength of VLMs, can be weaponized to compromise the integrity of search rankings without triggering conventional content filters.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12263v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Opportunistic Scheduling for Optimal Spot Instance Savings in the Cloud</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12266</link><description>arXiv:2601.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling delay-sensitive jobs over spot and on-demand cloud instances to minimize average cost while meeting an average delay constraint. Jobs arrive as a general stochastic process, and incur different costs based on the instance type. This work provides the first analytical treatment of this problem using tools from queuing theory, stochastic processes, and optimization. We derive cost expressions for general policies, prove queue length one is optimal for low target delays, and characterize the optimal wait-time distribution. For high target delays, we identify a knapsack structure and design a scheduling policy that exploits it. An adaptive algorithm is proposed to fully utilize the allowed delay, and empirical results confirm its near-optimality.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Simulated Annealing Enhances Theory-of-Mind Reasoning in Autoregressive Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12269</link><description>arXiv:2601.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive language models are next-token predictors and have been criticized for only optimizing surface plausibility (i.e., local coherence) rather than maintaining correct latent-state representations (i.e., global coherence). Because Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks crucially depend on reasoning about latent mental states of oneself and others, such models are therefore often thought to fail at ToM. While post-training methods can improve ToM performance, we show that strong ToM capability can be recovered directly from the base model without any additional weight updates or verifications. Our approach builds on recent power-sampling methods (Karan &amp; Du, 2025) that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from sharpened sequence-level (rather than token-level) probability distributions of autoregressive language models. We further find that incorporating annealing, where the tempered distribution is gradually shifted from high to low temperature, substantially improves ToM performance over fixed-temperature power sampling. Together, these results suggest that sampling-based optimization provides a powerful way to extract latent capabilities from language models without retraining.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12269v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SplittingSecrets: A Compiler-Based Defense for Preventing Data Memory-Dependent Prefetcher Side-Channels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12270</link><description>arXiv:2601.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional side-channels take advantage of secrets being used as inputs to unsafe instructions, used for memory accesses, or used in control flow decisions. Constant-time programming, which restricts such code patterns, has been widely adopted as a defense against these vulnerabilities. However, new hardware optimizations in the form of Data Memory-dependent Prefetchers (DMP) present in Apple, Intel, and ARM CPUs have shown such defenses are not sufficient. These prefetchers, unlike classical prefetchers, use the content of memory as well as the trace of prior accesses to determine prefetch targets. An adversary abusing such a prefetcher has been shown to be able to mount attacks leaking data-at-rest; data that is never used by the program, even speculatively, in an unsafe manner.
  In response, this paper introduces SplittingSecrets, a compiler-based tool that can harden software libraries against side-channels arising from DMPs. SplittingSecrets's approach avoids reasoning about the complex internals of different DMPs and instead relies on one key aspect of all DMPs: activation requires data to resemble addresses. To prevent secret data from leaking, SplittingSecrets transforms memory operations to ensure that secrets are never stored in memory in a manner resembling an address, thereby avoiding DMP activation on those secrets. Rather than disable a DMP entirely, SplittingSecrets can provide targeted hardening for only specific secrets entirely in software.
  We have implemented SplittingSecrets using LLVM, supporting both source-level memory operations and those generated by the compiler backend for the AArch64 architecture, We have analyzed the performance overhead involved in safeguarding secrets from DMP-induced attacks using common primitives in libsodium, a popular cryptographic library when built for Apple M-series CPUs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12270v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgenticPruner: MAC-Constrained Neural Network Compression via LLM-Driven Strategy Search</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12272</link><description>arXiv:2601.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network pruning remains essential for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained devices, yet existing approaches primarily target parameter reduction without directly controlling computational cost. This yields unpredictable inference latency in deployment scenarios where strict Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operation budgets must be met. We propose AgenticPruner, a framework utilizing large language models to achieve MAC-constrained optimization through iterative strategy learning. Our approach coordinates three specialized agents: a Profiling Agent that analyzes model architecture and MAC distributions, a Master Agent that orchestrates the workflow with divergence monitoring, and an Analysis Agent powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet that learns optimal strategies from historical attempts. Through in-context learning, the Analysis Agent improves convergence success rate from 48% to 71% compared to grid search. Building upon isomorphic pruning's graph-based structural grouping, our method adds context-aware adaptation by analyzing patterns across pruning iterations, enabling automatic convergence to target MAC budgets within user-defined tolerance bands.
  We validate our framework on ImageNet-1K across ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DeiT architectures. On CNNs, our approach achieves MAC targeting while maintaining or improving accuracy: ResNet-50 reaches 1.77G MACs with 77.04% accuracy (+0.91% vs baseline); ResNet-101 achieves 4.22G MACs with 78.94% accuracy (+1.56% vs baseline). For ConvNeXt-Small, pruning to 8.17G MACs yields 1.41x GPU and 1.07x CPU speedup with 45% parameter reduction. On Vision Transformers, we demonstrate MAC-budget compliance within user-defined tolerance bands (typically +1% to +5% overshoot, -5% to -15% undershoot), establishing feasibility for deployment scenarios requiring strict computational guarantees.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12272v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Leveraging Mutation Analysis for LLM-based Repair of Quantum Programs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12273</link><description>arXiv:2601.12273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques specifically designed for quantum programs have been proposed. However, existing approaches often suffer from low repair success rates or poor understandability of the generated patches. In this study, we construct a framework in which a large language model (LLM) generates code repairs along with a natural language explanation of the applied repairs. To investigate how the contextual information included in prompts influences APR performance for quantum programs, we design four prompt configurations with different combinations of static information, dynamic information, and mutation analysis results. Mutation analysis evaluates how small changes to specific parts of a program affect its execution results and provides more detailed dynamic information than simple execution outputs such as stack traces. Our experimental results show that mutation analysis can provide valuable contextual information for LLM-based APR of quantum programs, improving repair success rates (achieving 94.4% in our experiment) and in some cases also improving the quality of generated explanations. Our findings point toward new directions for developing APR techniques for quantum programs that enhance both reliability and explainability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12273v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid Concolic Testing with Large Language Models for Guided Path Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12274</link><description>arXiv:2601.12274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concolic testing, a powerful hybrid software testing technique, has historically been plagued by fundamental limitations such as path explosion and the high cost of constraint solving, which hinder its practical application in large-scale, real-world software systems. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework that synergistically integrates concolic execution with Large Language Models (LLMs) to overcome these challenges. Our hybrid approach leverages the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide path exploration, prioritize interesting execution paths, and assist in constraint solving. We formally define the system architecture and algorithms that constitute this new paradigm. Through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real-world Fintech applications, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms traditional concolic testing, random testing, and genetic algorithm-based methods in terms of branch coverage, path coverage, and time-to-coverage. The results indicate that by combining the strengths of both concolic execution and LLMs, our method achieves a more efficient and effective exploration of the program state space, leading to improved bug detection capabilities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12274v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Predictive Prototyping: Evaluating Design Concepts with ChatGPT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12276</link><description>arXiv:2601.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design-build-test cycle is essential for innovation, but physical prototyping is often slow and expensive. Although physics-based simulation and strategic prototyping can reduce cost, meaningful evaluation is frequently constrained until an integrated prototype is built. This paper investigates whether a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) can predict information typically obtained through prototyping, including cost, performance, and perceived usability. We introduce a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to emulate design feedback using OpenAI GPT-4o, grounded in prototyping data scraped from Instructables.com to increase access to relevant precedent. Two studies are reported. First, a controlled experiment compares GPT-RAG and human designers, who receive design sketches and predict cost, performance, and usability; predictions are evaluated against ground-truth results from physical prototypes. Second, we report an applied demonstration in which a physical prototype is produced from GPT-RAG recommendations and compared with a commercial baseline and a topology-optimized design. Results show that GPT-RAG provides more accurate cost and performance estimates than individual or crowd human estimates, while yielding comparable usability insights; the GPT-RAG-informed prototype also outperforms both comparison prototypes. Repeated querying with response averaging significantly improves accuracy, suggesting that LLMs can emulate crowd aggregation effects consistent with the law of large numbers.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12276v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] An Efficient and Multi-Modal Navigation System with One-Step World Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12277</link><description>arXiv:2601.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental capability for mobile robots. While the current trend is to use learning-based approaches to replace traditional geometry-based methods, existing end-to-end learning-based policies often struggle with 3D spatial reasoning and lack a comprehensive understanding of physical world dynamics. Integrating world models-which predict future observations conditioned on given actions-with iterative optimization planning offers a promising solution due to their capacity for imagination and flexibility. However, current navigation world models, typically built on pure transformer architectures, often rely on multi-step diffusion processes and autoregressive frame-by-frame generation. These mechanisms result in prohibitive computational latency, rendering real-time deployment impossible. To address this bottleneck, we propose a lightweight navigation world model that adopts a one-step generation paradigm and a 3D U-Net backbone equipped with efficient spatial-temporal attention. This design drastically reduces inference latency, enabling high-frequency control while achieving superior predictive performance. We also integrate this model into an optimization-based planning framework utilizing anchor-based initialization to handle multi-modal goal navigation tasks. Extensive closed-loop experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate our system's superior efficiency and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12277v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] HCFT: Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer for EEG Decoding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12279</link><description>arXiv:2601.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) decoding requires models that can effectively extract and integrate complex temporal, spectral, and spatial features from multichannel signals. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight and generalizable decoding framework named Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer (HCFT), which combines dual-branch convolutional encoders and hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale EEG representation learning. Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that each core component of the proposed framework contributes significantly to the overall decoding performance, demonstrating HCFT's effectiveness in capturing EEG dynamics and its potential for real-world BCI applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12279v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Democratizing Music Therapy: LLM-Based Automated EEG Analysis and Progress Tracking for Low-Cost Home Devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12280</link><description>arXiv:2601.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Home-based music therapy devices require accessible and cost-effective solutions for users to understand and track their therapeutic progress. Traditional physiological signal analysis, particularly EEG interpretation, relies heavily on domain experts, creating barriers to scalability and home adoption. Meanwhile, few experts are capable of interpreting physiological signal data while also making targeted music recommendations. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various domains, their application to automated physiological report generation for music therapy represents an unexplored task. We present a prototype system that leverages LLMs to bridge this gap -- transforming raw EEG and cardiovascular data into human-readable therapeutic reports and personalized music recommendations. Unlike prior work focusing on real-time physiological adaptation during listening, our approach emphasizes post-session analysis and interpretable reporting, enabling non-expert users to comprehend their psychophysiological states and track therapeutic outcomes over time. By integrating signal processing modules with LLM-based reasoning agents, the system provides a practical and low-cost solution for short-term progress monitoring in home music therapy contexts. This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying LLMs to a novel task -- democratizing access to physiology-driven music therapy through automated, interpretable reporting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12280v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CytoCLIP: Learning Cytoarchitectural Characteristics in Developing Human Brain Using Contrastive Language Image Pre-Training</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12282</link><description>arXiv:2601.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functions of different regions of the human brain are closely linked to their distinct cytoarchitecture, which is defined by the spatial arrangement and morphology of the cells. Identifying brain regions by their cytoarchitecture enables various scientific analyses of the brain. However, delineating these areas manually in brain histological sections is time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge. An automated approach is necessary to minimize the effort needed from human experts. To address this, we propose CytoCLIP, a suite of vision-language models derived from pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) frameworks to learn joint visual-text representations of brain cytoarchitecture. CytoCLIP comprises two model variants: one is trained using low-resolution whole-region images to understand the overall cytoarchitectural pattern of an area, and the other is trained on high-resolution image tiles for detailed cellular-level representation. The training dataset is created from NISSL-stained histological sections of developing fetal brains of different gestational weeks. It includes 86 distinct regions for low-resolution images and 384 brain regions for high-resolution tiles. We evaluate the model's understanding of the cytoarchitecture and generalization ability using region classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Multiple experiments are performed under various data setups, including data from samples of different ages and sectioning planes. Experimental results demonstrate that CytoCLIP outperforms existing methods. It achieves an F1 score of 0.87 for whole-region classification and 0.91 for high-resolution image tile classification.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12282v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SDiT: Semantic Region-Adaptive for Diffusion Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12283</link><description>arXiv:2601.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image synthesis but remain computationally expensive due to the iterative nature of denoising and the quadratic cost of global attention. In this work, we observe that denoising dynamics are spatially non-uniform-background regions converge rapidly while edges and textured areas evolve much more actively. Building on this insight, we propose SDiT, a Semantic Region-Adaptive Diffusion Transformer that allocates computation according to regional complexity. SDiT introduces a training-free framework combining (1) semantic-aware clustering via fast Quickshift-based segmentation, (2) complexity-driven regional scheduling to selectively update informative areas, and (3) boundary-aware refinement to maintain spatial coherence. Without any model retraining or architectural modification, SDiT achieves up to 3.0x acceleration while preserving nearly identical perceptual and semantic quality to full-attention inference.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12283v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Safe Is Your Data in Connected and Autonomous Cars: A Consumer Advantage or a Privacy Nightmare ?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12284</link><description>arXiv:2601.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the automobile sector, driven by advancements in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), has transformed how vehicles communicate, operate, and interact with their surroundings. Technologies such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication enable autonomous cars to generate and exchange substantial amounts of data with real-world entities, enhancing safety, improving performance, and delivering personalized user experiences. However, this data-driven ecosystem introduces significant challenges, particularly concerning data privacy, security, and governance. The absence of transparency and comprehensive regulatory frameworks exacerbates issues of unauthorized data access, prolonged retention, and potential misuse, creating tension between consumer benefits and privacy risks. This review paper explores the multifaceted nature of data sharing in CAVs, analyzing its contributions to innovation and its associated vulnerabilities. It evaluates data-sharing mechanisms and communication technologies, highlights the benefits of data exchange across various use cases, examines privacy concerns and risks of data misuse, and critically reviews regulatory frameworks and their inadequacies in safeguarding user privacy. By providing a thorough analysis of the current state of data sharing in the automotive sector, the paper emphasizes the urgent need for robust policies and ethical data management practices. It calls for striking a balance between fostering technological advancements and ensuring secure, consumer-friendly solutions, paving the way for a trustworthy and innovative automotive future.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LegacyAvatars: Volumetric Face Avatars For Traditional Graphics Pipelines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12285</link><description>arXiv:2601.12285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel representation for efficient classical rendering of photorealistic 3D face avatars. Leveraging recent advances in radiance fields anchored to parametric face models, our approach achieves controllable volumetric rendering of complex facial features, including hair, skin, and eyes. At enrollment time, we learn a set of radiance manifolds in 3D space to extract an explicit layered mesh, along with appearance and warp textures. During deployment, this allows us to control and animate the face through simple linear blending and alpha compositing of textures over a static mesh. This explicit representation also enables the generated avatar to be efficiently streamed online and then rendered using classical mesh and shader-based rendering on legacy graphics platforms, eliminating the need for any custom engineering or integration.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Conversational Context Classification: A Representation Engineering Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12286</link><description>arXiv:2601.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demands effective safeguards for their operation, particularly concerning their tendency to generate out-of-context responses. A key challenge is accurately detecting when LLMs stray from expected conversational norms, manifesting as topic shifts, factual inaccuracies, or outright hallucinations. Traditional anomaly detection struggles to directly apply within contextual semantics. This paper outlines our experiment in exploring the use of Representation Engineering (RepE) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to identify subspaces within the internal states of LLMs that represent a specific context. By training OCSVM on in-context examples, we establish a robust boundary within the LLM's hidden state latent space. We evaluate out study with two open source LLMs - Llama and Qwen models in specific contextual domain. Our approach entailed identifying the optimal layers within the LLM's internal state subspaces that strongly associates with the context of interest. Our evaluation results showed promising results in identifying the subspace for a specific context. Aside from being useful in detecting in or out of context conversation threads, this research work contributes to the study of better interpreting LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12286v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] TimeGMM: Single-Pass Probabilistic Forecasting via Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models with Reversible Normalization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12288</link><description>arXiv:2601.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic time series forecasting is crucial for quantifying future uncertainty, with significant applications in fields such as energy and finance. However, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive sampling or restrictive parametric assumptions to characterize future distributions, which limits predictive performance and introduces distributional mismatch. To address these challenges, this paper presents TimeGMM, a novel probabilistic forecasting framework based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) that captures complex future distributions in a single forward pass. A key component is GMM-adapted Reversible Instance Normalization (GRIN), a novel module designed to dynamically adapt to temporal-probabilistic distribution shifts. The framework integrates a dedicated Temporal Encoder (TE-Module) with a Conditional Temporal-Probabilistic Decoder (CTPD-Module) to jointly capture temporal dependencies and mixture distribution parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeGMM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving maximum improvements of 22.48\% in CRPS and 21.23\% in NMAE.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12288v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ParaMETA: Towards Learning Disentangled Paralinguistic Speaking Styles Representations from Speech</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12289</link><description>arXiv:2601.12289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning representative embeddings for different types of speaking styles, such as emotion, age, and gender, is critical for both recognition tasks (e.g., cognitive computing and human-computer interaction) and generative tasks (e.g., style-controllable speech generation). In this work, we introduce ParaMETA, a unified and flexible framework for learning and controlling speaking styles directly from speech. Unlike existing methods that rely on single-task models or cross-modal alignment, ParaMETA learns disentangled, task-specific embeddings by projecting speech into dedicated subspaces for each type of style. This design reduces inter-task interference, mitigates negative transfer, and allows a single model to handle multiple paralinguistic tasks such as emotion, gender, age, and language classification. Beyond recognition, ParaMETA enables fine-grained style control in Text-To-Speech (TTS) generative models. It supports both speech- and text-based prompting and allows users to modify one speaking styles while preserving others. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ParaMETA outperforms strong baselines in classification accuracy and generates more natural and expressive speech, while maintaining a lightweight and efficient model suitable for real-world applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12289v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Re-educating Educated Ones: A Case Study on Chakma Language Revitalization in Chittagong Hill Tracts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12290</link><description>arXiv:2601.12290v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Scalable and maintainable map representations are fundamental to enabling large-scale visual navigation and facilitating the deployment of robots in real-world environments. While collaborative localization across multi-session mapping enhances efficiency, traditional structure-based methods struggle with high maintenance costs and fail in feature-less environments or under significant viewpoint changes typical of crowd-sourced data. To address this, we propose OPENNAVMAP, a lightweight, structure-free topometric system leveraging 3D geometric foundation models for on-demand reconstruction. Our method unifies dynamic programming-based sequence matching, geometric verification, and confidence-calibrated optimization to robust, coarse-to-fine submap alignment without requiring pre-built 3D models. Evaluations on the Map-Free benchmark demonstrate superior accuracy over structure-from-motion and regression baselines, achieving an average translation error of 0.62m. Furthermore, the system maintains global consistency across 15km of multi-session data with an absolute trajectory error below 3m for map merging. Finally, we validate practical utility through 12 successful autonomous image-goal navigation tasks on simulated and physical robots.

Abstract: Reward-guided search methods have demonstrated strong potential in enhancing tool-using agents by effectively guiding sampling and exploration over complex action spaces. As a core design, those search methods utilize process reward models (PRMs) to provide step-level rewards, enabling more fine-grained monitoring. However, there is a lack of systematic and reliable evaluation benchmarks for PRMs in tool-using settings. In this paper, we introduce ToolPRMBench, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate PRMs for tool-using agents. ToolPRMBench is built on top of several representative tool-using benchmarks and converts agent trajectories into step-level test cases. Each case contains the interaction history, a correct action, a plausible but incorrect alternative, and relevant tool metadata. We respectively utilize offline sampling to isolate local single-step errors and online sampling to capture realistic multi-step failures from full agent rollouts. A multi-LLM verification pipeline is proposed to reduce label noise and ensure data quality. We conduct extensive experiments across large language models, general PRMs, and tool-specialized PRMs on ToolPRMBench. The results reveal clear differences in PRM effectiveness and highlight the potential of specialized PRMs for tool-using.

Abstract: Edge deployment of low-batch large language models (LLMs) faces critical memory bandwidth bottlenecks when executing memory-intensive general matrix-vector multiplications (GEMV) operations. While digital processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures promise to accelerate GEMV operations, existing PIM-equipped edge devices still suffer from three key limitations: limited bandwidth improvement, component under-utilization in mixed workloads, and low compute capacity of computing units (CUs). In this paper, we propose CD-PIM to address these challenges through three key innovations. First, we introduce a high-bandwidth compute-efficient mode (HBCEM) that enhances bandwidth by dividing each bank into four pseudo-banks through segmented global bitlines. Second, we propose a low-batch interleaving mode (LBIM) to improve component utilization by overlapping GEMV operations with GEMM operations. Third, we design a compute-efficient CU that performs enhanced GEMV operations in a pipelined manner by serially feeding weight data into the computing core. Forth, we adopt a column-wise mapping for the key-cache matrix and row-wise mapping for the value-cache matrix, which fully utilizes CU resources. Our evaluation shows that compared to a GPU-only baseline and state-of-the-art PIM designs, our CD-PIM achieves 11.42x and 4.25x speedup on average within a single batch in HBCEM mode, respectively. Moreover, for low-batch sizes, the CD-PIM achieves an average speedup of 1.12x in LBIM compared to HBCEM.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12298v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model with Text-Enhanced Pre-training for Sequential Recommendation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12301</link><description>arXiv:2601.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) systems excel at capturing users' dynamic preferences by leveraging their interaction histories. Most existing SR systems assign a single embedding vector to each item to represent its features, adopting various models to combine these embeddings into a sequence representation that captures user intent. However, we argue that this representation alone is insufficient to capture an item's multi-faceted nature (e.g., movie genres, starring actors). Furthermore, users often exhibit complex and varied preferences within these facets (e.g., liking both action and musical films within the genre facet), which are challenging to fully represent with static identifiers. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture titled Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential Recommendation (FAME). We leverage sub-embeddings from each head in the final multi-head attention layer to predict the next item separately, effectively capturing distinct item facets. A gating mechanism then integrates these predictions by dynamically determining their importance. Additionally, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network within each attention head to disentangle varied user preferences within each facet, utilizing a learnable router network to aggregate expert outputs based on context. Complementing this architecture, we design a Text-Enhanced Facet-Aware Pre-training module to overcome the limitations of randomly initialized embeddings. By utilizing a pre-trained text encoder and employing an alternating supervised contrastive learning objective, we explicitly disentangle facet-specific features from textual metadata (e.g., descriptions) before sequential training begins. This ensures that the item embeddings are semantically robust and aligned with the downstream multi-facet framework.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12301v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] On the Minimum Length of Functional Batch Codes with Small Recovery Sets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12302</link><description>arXiv:2601.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch codes are of potential use for load balancing and private information retrieval in distributed data storage systems. Recently, a special case of batch codes, termed functional batch codes, was proposed in the literature. In functional batch codes, users can query linear combinations of the information symbols, and not only the information symbols themselves, as is the case for standard batch codes. In this work, we consider linear functional batch codes with the additional property that every query is answered by using only a small number of coded symbols. We derive bounds on the minimum length of such codes, and evaluate the results by numerical computations.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12302v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Concepts from Representations: Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Models via Sparse Decomposition of Visual Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12303</link><description>arXiv:2601.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in image recognition, yet their inherent opacity poses challenges for deployment in critical domains. Concept-based interpretations aim to address this by explaining model reasoning through human-understandable concepts. However, existing post-hoc methods and ante-hoc concept bottleneck models (CBMs), suffer from limitations such as unreliable concept relevance, non-visual or labor-intensive concept definitions, and model or data-agnostic assumptions. This paper introduces Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Model via Representation Decomposition (PCBM-ReD), a novel pipeline that retrofits interpretability onto pretrained opaque models. PCBM-ReD automatically extracts visual concepts from a pre-trained encoder, employs multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to label and filter concepts based on visual identifiability and task relevance, and selects an independent subset via reconstruction-guided optimization. Leveraging CLIP's visual-text alignment, it decomposes image representations into linear combination of concept embeddings to fit into the CBMs abstraction. Extensive experiments across 11 image classification tasks show PCBM-ReD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, narrows the performance gap with end-to-end models, and exhibits better interpretability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12303v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Two-Stage Globally-Diverse Adversarial Attack for Vision-Language Pre-training Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12304</link><description>arXiv:2601.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, particularly in black-box scenarios. Existing multimodal attacks often suffer from limited perturbation diversity and unstable multi-stage pipelines. To address these challenges, we propose 2S-GDA, a two-stage globally-diverse attack framework. The proposed method first introduces textual perturbations through a globally-diverse strategy by combining candidate text expansion with globally-aware replacement. To enhance visual diversity, image-level perturbations are generated using multi-scale resizing and block-shuffle rotation. Extensive experiments on VLP models demonstrate that 2S-GDA consistently improves attack success rates over state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 11.17\% in black-box settings. Our framework is modular and can be easily combined with existing methods to further enhance adversarial transferability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12304v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) Dataset Generator Framework for IoT Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12305</link><description>arXiv:2601.12305v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show that workflows composed of multiple LLM agents with distinct roles, tools, and communication patterns can outperform single-LLM baselines on complex tasks. However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research. We also note that single-LLM methods cannot capture heterogeneous workflows due to the lack of KV cache sharing across different LLMs, highlighting future opportunities in developing \textit{truly} heterogeneous multi-agent systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12307v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adaptive Multi-Scale Correlation Meta-Network for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12308</link><description>arXiv:2601.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning in remote sensing remains challenging due to three factors: the scarcity of labeled data, substantial domain shifts, and the multi-scale nature of geospatial objects. To address these issues, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Scale Correlation Meta-Network (AMC-MetaNet), a lightweight yet powerful framework with three key innovations: (i) correlation-guided feature pyramids for capturing scale-invariant patterns, (ii) an adaptive channel correlation module (ACCM) for learning dynamic cross-scale relationships, and (iii) correlation-guided meta-learning that leverages correlation patterns instead of conventional prototype averaging. Unlike prior approaches that rely on heavy pre-trained models or transformers, AMC-MetaNet is trained from scratch with only $\sim600K$ parameters, offering $20\times$ fewer parameters than ResNet-18 while maintaining high efficiency ($&lt;50$ms per image inference). AMC-MetaNet achieves up to 86.65\% accuracy in 5-way 5-shot classification on various remote sensing datasets, including EuroSAT, NWPU-RESISC45, UC Merced Land Use, and AID. Our results establish AMC-MetaNet as a computationally efficient, scale-aware framework for real-world few-shot remote sensing.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12308v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Survival is the Only Reward: Sustainable Self-Training Through Environment-Mediated Selection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12310</link><description>arXiv:2601.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-training systems often degenerate due to the lack of an external criterion for judging data quality, leading to reward hacking and semantic drift. This paper provides a proof-of-concept system architecture for stable self-training under sparse external feedback and bounded memory, and empirically characterises its learning dynamics and failure modes.
  We introduce a self-training architecture in which learning is mediated exclusively by environmental viability, rather than by reward, objective functions, or externally defined fitness criteria. Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.
  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction. This work establishes that environment-grounded selection enables sustainable open-ended self-improvement, offering a viable path toward more robust and generalisable autonomous systems without reliance on human-curated data or complex reward shaping.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12310v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cross-reality Location Privacy Protection in 6G-enabled Vehicular Metaverses: An LLM-enhanced Hybrid Generative Diffusion Model-based Approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12311</link><description>arXiv:2601.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses enables Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to operate across physical and virtual spaces through space-air-ground-sea integrated networks. The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates cross-reality location privacy leakage for AVs while maintaining strong user immersion within 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12311v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CurConMix+: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Framework for Hierarchical Surgical Workflow Understanding</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12312</link><description>arXiv:2601.12312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical action triplet recognition aims to understand fine-grained surgical behaviors by modeling the interactions among instruments, actions, and anatomical targets. Despite its clinical importance for workflow analysis and skill assessment, progress has been hindered by severe class imbalance, subtle visual variations, and the semantic interdependence among triplet components. Existing approaches often address only a subset of these challenges rather than tackling them jointly, which limits their ability to form a holistic understanding. This study builds upon CurConMix, a spatial representation framework. At its core, a curriculum-guided contrastive learning strategy learns discriminative and progressively correlated features, further enhanced by structured hard-pair sampling and feature-level mixup. Its temporal extension, CurConMix+, integrates a Multi-Resolution Temporal Transformer (MRTT) that achieves robust, context-aware understanding by adaptively fusing multi-scale temporal features and dynamically balancing spatio-temporal cues. Furthermore, we introduce LLS48, a new, hierarchically annotated benchmark for complex laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy, providing step-, task-, and action-level annotations. Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and LLS48 demonstrate that CurConMix+ not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in triplet recognition, but also exhibits strong cross-level generalization, as its fine-grained features effectively transfer to higher-level phase and step recognition tasks. Together, the framework and dataset provide a unified foundation for hierarchy-aware, reproducible, and interpretable surgical workflow understanding. The code and dataset will be publicly released on GitHub to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12312v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] S^2F-Net:A Robust Spatial-Spectral Fusion Framework for Cross-Model AIGC Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12313</link><description>arXiv:2601.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has imposed an urgent demand for detection schemes with strong generalization capabilities. However, existing detection methods generally suffer from overfitting to specific source models, leading to significant performance degradation when confronted with unseen generative architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cross-model detection framework called S 2 F-Net, whose core lies in exploring and leveraging the inherent spectral discrepancies between real and synthetic textures. Considering that upsampling operations leave unique and distinguishable frequency fingerprints in both texture-poor and texture-rich regions, we focus our research on the detection of frequency-domain artifacts, aiming to fundamentally improve the generalization performance of the model. Specifically, we introduce a learnable frequency attention module that adaptively weights and enhances discriminative frequency bands by synergizing spatial texture analysis and spectral dependencies.On the AIGCDetectBenchmark, which includes 17 categories of generative models, S 2 F-Net achieves a detection accuracy of 90.49%, significantly outperforming various existing baseline methods in cross-domain detection scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12313v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Similarity Network for Correlating Musical Structure to Military Strategy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12314</link><description>arXiv:2601.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music perception, a multi-sensory process based on the synesthesia effect, is an essential component of music aesthetic education. Understanding music structure helps both perception and aesthetic education. Music structure incorporates a range of information, the coordination of which forms the melody, just as different military actions cooperate to produce a military strategy. However, there are a few ways for assessing music perception from the perspectives of system operation and information management. In this paper, we explore the similarities between music structure and military strategy while creating the Music Clips Correlation Network (MCCN) based on Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). The inspiration comes from the comparison between a concert conductor's musical score and a military war commander's sand table exercise. Specifically, we create MCCNs for various kinds of war movie soundtracks, then relate military tactics (Sun Tzu's Art of War, etc.) and political institutions to military operations networks. Our primary findings suggest a few similarities, implying that music perception and aesthetic education can be approached from a military strategy and management perspective through this interdisciplinary research. Similarly, we can discover similarities between the art of military scheming and the art of musical structure based on network analysis in order to facilitate the understanding of the relationship between technology and art.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12314v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] GazeFormer-MoE: Context-Aware Gaze Estimation via CLIP and MoE Transformer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12316</link><description>arXiv:2601.12316v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The advancement of Document Intelligence (DI) demands large-scale, high-quality training data, yet manual annotation remains a critical bottleneck. While data generation methods are evolving rapidly, existing surveys are constrained by fragmented focuses on single modalities or specific tasks, lacking a unified perspective aligned with real-world workflows. To fill this gap, this survey establishes the first comprehensive technical map for data generation in DI. Data generation is redefined as supervisory signal production, and a novel taxonomy is introduced based on the "availability of data and labels." This framework organizes methodologies into four resource-centric paradigms: Data Augmentation, Data Generation from Scratch, Automated Data Annotation, and Self-Supervised Signal Construction. Furthermore, a multi-level evaluation framework is established to integrate intrinsic quality and extrinsic utility, compiling performance gains across diverse DI benchmarks. Guided by this unified structure, the methodological landscape is dissected to reveal critical challenges such as fidelity gaps and frontiers including co-evolutionary ecosystems. Ultimately, by systematizing this fragmented field, data generation is positioned as the central engine for next-generation DI.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12318v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Ordered Local Momentum for Asynchronous Distributed Learning under Arbitrary Delays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12322</link><description>arXiv:2601.12322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum SGD (MSGD) serves as a foundational optimizer in training deep models due to momentum's key role in accelerating convergence and enhancing generalization. Meanwhile, asynchronous distributed learning is crucial for training large-scale deep models, especially when the computing capabilities of the workers in the cluster are heterogeneous. To reduce communication frequency, local updates are widely adopted in distributed learning. However, how to implement asynchronous distributed MSGD with local updates remains unexplored. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method, called \underline{or}dered \underline{lo}cal \underline{mo}mentum (OrLoMo), for asynchronous distributed learning. In OrLoMo, each worker runs MSGD locally. Then the local momentum from each worker will be aggregated by the server in order based on its global iteration index. To the best of our knowledge, OrLoMo is the first method to implement asynchronous distributed MSGD with local updates. We prove the convergence of OrLoMo for non-convex problems under arbitrary delays. Experiments validate that OrLoMo can outperform its synchronous counterpart and other asynchronous methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12322v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MARO: Learning Stronger Reasoning from Social Interaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12323</link><description>arXiv:2601.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans face countless scenarios that require reasoning and judgment in daily life. However, existing large language model training methods primarily allow models to learn from existing textual content or solve predetermined problems, lacking experience in real scenarios involving interaction, negotiation, and competition with others. To address this, this paper proposes Multi-Agent Reward Optimization (MARO), a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire stronger reasoning abilities by learning and practicing in multi-agent social environments. Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following. This reveals the tremendous potential of multi-agent social learning in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12323v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Experiencer, Helper, or Observer: Online Fraud Intervention for Older Adults Through Role-based Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12324</link><description>arXiv:2601.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online fraud is a critical global threat that disproportionately targets older adults. Prior anti-fraud education for older adults has largely relied on static, traditional instruction that limits engagement and real-world transfer, whereas role-based simulation offers realistic yet low-risk opportunities for practice. Moreover, most interventions situate learners as victims, overlooking that fraud encounters often involve multiple roles, such as bystanders who witness scams and helpers who support victims. To address this gap, we developed ROLESafe, an anti-fraud educational intervention in which older adults learn through different learning roles, including Experiencer (experiencing fraud), Helper (assisting a victim), and Observer (witnessing fraud). In a between-subjects study with 144 older adults in China, we found that the Experiencer and Helper roles significantly improved participants' ability to identify online fraud. These findings highlight the promise of role-based, multi-perspective simulations for enhancing fraud awareness among older adults and provide design implications for future anti-fraud education.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Sensor Matching with HyperNetworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12325</link><description>arXiv:2601.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypernetworks are models that generate or modulate the weights of another network. They provide a flexible mechanism for injecting context and task conditioning and have proven broadly useful across diverse applications without significant increases in model size. We leverage hypernetworks to improve multimodal patch matching by introducing a lightweight descriptor-learning architecture that augments a Siamese CNN with (i) hypernetwork modules that compute adaptive, per-channel scaling and shifting and (ii) conditional instance normalization that provides modality-specific adaptation (e.g., visible vs. infrared, VIS-IR) in shallow layers. This combination preserves the efficiency of descriptor-based methods during inference while increasing robustness to appearance shifts. Trained with a triplet loss and hard-negative mining, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on VIS-NIR and other VIS-IR benchmarks and matches or surpasses prior methods on additional datasets, despite their higher inference cost. To spur progress on domain shift, we also release GAP-VIR, a cross-platform (ground/aerial) VIS-IR patch dataset with 500K pairs, enabling rigorous evaluation of cross-domain generalization and adaptation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12325v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] EmoKGEdit: Training-free Affective Injection via Visual Cue Transformation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12326</link><description>arXiv:2601.12326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing image emotion editing methods struggle to disentangle emotional cues from latent content representations, often yielding weak emotional expression and distorted visual structures. To bridge this gap, we propose EmoKGEdit, a novel training-free framework for precise and structure-preserving image emotion editing. Specifically, we construct a Multimodal Sentiment Association Knowledge Graph (MSA-KG) to disentangle the intricate relationships among objects, scenes, attributes, visual clues and emotion. MSA-KG explicitly encode the causal chain among object-attribute-emotion, and as external knowledge to support chain of thought reasoning, guiding the multimodal large model to infer plausible emotion-related visual cues and generate coherent instructions. In addition, based on MSA-KG, we design a disentangled structure-emotion editing module that explicitly separates emotional attributes from layout features within the latent space, which ensures that the target emotion is effectively injected while strictly maintaining visual spatial coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoKGEdit achieves excellent performance in both emotion fidelity and content preservation, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Expert Validation Framework (EVF): Enabling Domain Expert Control in AI Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12327</link><description>arXiv:2601.12327v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Intrinsic Image Decomposition (IID) separates an image into albedo and shading components. It is a core step in many real-world applications, such as relighting and material editing. Existing IID models achieve good results, but often use a large number of parameters. This makes them costly to combine with other models in real-world settings. To address this problem, we propose a flow matching-based solution. For this, we design a novel architecture, FlowIID, based on latent flow matching. FlowIID combines a VAE-guided latent space with a flow matching module, enabling a stable decomposition of albedo and shading. FlowIID is not only parameter-efficient, but also produces results in a single inference step. Despite its compact design, FlowIID delivers competitive and superior results compared to existing models across various benchmarks. This makes it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained and real-time vision applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12329v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] IceWatch: Forecasting Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) using Multimodal Deep Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12330</link><description>arXiv:2601.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) pose a serious threat in high mountain regions. They are hazardous to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems further downstream. The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12330v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Privacy-Preserving Retrieval Augmented Generation with Distance-Preserving Encryption</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12331</link><description>arXiv:2601.12331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RAG has emerged as a key technique for enhancing response quality of LLMs without high computational cost. In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced cloud storage. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces privacy risks. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed but most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. We propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To mitigate query analysis, we introduce DP by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns. Experimental results show that ppRAG achieves efficient processing throughput, high retrieval accuracy, strong privacy guarantees, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained users seeking secure cloud-augmented LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12331v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Worst-case Nonlinear Regression with Error Bounds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12334</link><description>arXiv:2601.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an active-learning approach to worst-case nonlinear regression with deterministic error guarantees. Given a known nonlinear function defined over a compact set, we compute a surrogate model, such as a feedforward neural network, by minimizing the maximum absolute approximation error. To address the nonsmooth nature of the resulting minimax problem, we introduce a smooth approximation of the $L_\infty$-type loss that enables efficient gradient-based training. We iteratively enrich the training set by actively learning points of largest approximation error through global optimization. The resulting models admit certified worst-case error bounds, either constant or input-dependent, over the entire input domain. The approach is demonstrated through approximations of nonlinear functions and nonconvex sets, as well as through the derivation of uncertain models of more complex nonlinear dynamics within a given model class, and the approximation of explicit model predictive control laws.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Turbo-GoDec: Exploiting the Cluster Sparsity Prior for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12337</link><description>arXiv:2601.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a key task in hyperspectral image processing, hyperspectral anomaly detection has garnered significant attention and undergone extensive research. Existing methods primarily relt on two prior assumption: low-rank background and sparse anomaly, along with additional spatial assumptions of the background. However, most methods only utilize the sparsity prior assumption for anomalies and rarely expand on this hypothesis. From observations of hyperspectral images, we find that anomalous pixels exhibit certain spatial distribution characteristics: they often manifest as small, clustered groups in space, which we refer to as cluster sparsity of anomalies. Then, we combined the cluster sparsity prior with the classical GoDec algorithm, incorporating the cluster sparsity prior into the S-step of GoDec. This resulted in a new hyperspectral anomaly detection method, which we called Turbo-GoDec. In this approach, we modeled the cluster sparsity prior of anomalies using a Markov random field and computed the marginal probabilities of anomalies through message passing on a factor graph.

Abstract: Customer reviews contain detailed, domain specific signals about service failures and user expectations, but converting this unstructured feedback into actionable business decisions remains difficult. We study review-to-action generation: producing concrete, implementable recommendations grounded in review text. We propose a modular two-LLM framework in which an Issue model extracts salient issues and assigns coarse themes, and an Advice model generates targeted operational fixes conditioned on the extracted issue representation. To enable specialization without expensive full fine-tuning, we adapt the Advice model using a mixture of LoRA experts strategy: multiple low-rank adapters are trained and a lightweight gating mechanism performs token-level expert mixing at inference, combining complementary expertise across issue types. We construct synthetic review-issue-advice triples from Yelp reviews (airlines and restaurants) to supervise training, and evaluate recommendations using an eight dimension operational rubric spanning actionability, specificity, feasibility, expected impact, novelty, non-redundancy, bias, and clarity. Across both domains, our approach consistently outperforms prompting-only and single-adapter baselines, yielding higher actionability and specificity while retaining favorable efficiency-quality trade-offs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12338v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Time-Continuous Modeling for Temporal Affective Pattern Recognition in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12341</link><description>arXiv:2601.12341v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) generate citation-rich reports via multi-step search and synthesis, yet existing benchmarks mainly target text-only settings or short-form multimodal QA, missing end-to-end multimodal evidence use. We introduce MMDeepResearch-Bench (MMDR-Bench), a benchmark of 140 expert-crafted tasks across 21 domains, where each task provides an image-text bundle to evaluate multimodal understanding and citation-grounded report generation. Compared to prior setups, MMDR-Bench emphasizes report-style synthesis with explicit evidence use, where models must connect visual artifacts to sourced claims and maintain consistency across narrative, citations, and visual references. We further propose a unified, interpretable evaluation pipeline: Formula-LLM Adaptive Evaluation (FLAE) for report quality, Trustworthy Retrieval-Aligned Citation Evaluation (TRACE) for citation-grounded evidence alignment, and Multimodal Support-Aligned Integrity Check (MOSAIC) for text-visual integrity, each producing fine-grained signals that support error diagnosis beyond a single overall score. Experiments across 25 state-of-the-art models reveal systematic trade-offs between generation quality, citation discipline, and multimodal grounding, highlighting that strong prose alone does not guarantee faithful evidence use and that multimodal integrity remains a key bottleneck for deep research agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12346v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RIPPLE++: An Incremental Framework for Efficient GNN Inference on Evolving Graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12347</link><description>arXiv:2601.12347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world graphs are dynamic, with frequent updates to their structure and features due to evolving vertex and edge properties. These continual changes pose significant challenges for efficient inference in graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing vertex-wise and layer-wise inference approaches are ill-suited for dynamic graphs, as they incur redundant computations, large neighborhood traversals, and high communication costs, especially in distributed settings. Additionally, while sampling-based approaches can be adopted to approximate final layer embeddings, these are often not preferred in critical applications due to their non-determinism. These limitations hinder low-latency inference required in real-time applications. To address this, we propose RIPPLE++, a framework for streaming GNN inference that efficiently and accurately updates embeddings in response to changes in the graph structure or features. RIPPLE++ introduces a generalized incremental programming model that captures the semantics of GNN aggregation functions and incrementally propagates updates to affected neighborhoods. RIPPLE++ accommodates all common graph updates, including vertex/edge addition/deletions and vertex feature updates. RIPPLE++ supports both single-machine and distributed deployments. On a single machine, it achieves up to $56$K updates/sec on sparse graphs like Arxiv ($169$K vertices, $1.2$M edges), and about $7.6$K updates/sec on denser graphs like Products ($2.5$M vertices, $123.7$M edges), with latencies of $0.06$--$960$ms, and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by $2.2$--$24\times$ on throughput. In distributed settings, RIPPLE++ offers up to $\approx25\times$ higher throughput and $20\times$ lower communication costs compared to recomputing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12347v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Generative AI Agents for Controllable and Protected Content Creation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12348</link><description>arXiv:2601.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI has transformed creative workflows, yet current systems face critical challenges in controllability and content protection. We propose a novel multi-agent framework that addresses both limitations through specialized agent roles and integrated watermarking mechanisms. Unlike existing multi-agent systems focused solely on generation quality, our approach uniquely combines controllable content synthesis with provenance protection during the generation process itself. The framework orchestrates Director/Planner, Generator, Reviewer, Integration, and Protection agents with human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure alignment with user intent while embedding imperceptible digital watermarks. We formalize the pipeline as a joint optimization objective unifying controllability, semantic alignment, and protection robustness. This work contributes to responsible generative AI by positioning multi-agent architectures as a solution for trustworthy creative workflows with built-in ownership tracking and content traceability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12348v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-Permission Manipulation: Can We Trust Large Multimodal Model Powered GUI Agents?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12349</link><description>arXiv:2601.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multimodal model powered GUI agents are emerging as high-privilege operators on mobile platforms, entrusted with perceiving screen content and injecting inputs. However, their design operates under the implicit assumption of Visual Atomicity: that the UI state remains invariant between observation and action. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface.
  We present Action Rebinding, a novel attack that allows a seemingly-benign app with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.
  We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal). Our findings reveal a fundamental architectural flaw in current agent-OS integration and provide critical insights for the secure design of future agent systems.

Abstract: The Coupon Collector Problem (CCP) is a well-known combinatorial problem that seeks to estimate the number of random draws required to complete a collection of $n$ distinct coupon types. Various generalizations of this problem have been applied in numerous engineering domains. However, practical applications are often hindered by the computational challenges associated with deriving numerical results for moments and distributions. In this work, we present three algorithms for solving the most general form of the CCP, where coupons are collected under any arbitrary drawing probability, with the objective of obtaining $t$ copies of a subset of $k$ coupons from a total of $n$. The First algorithm provides the base model to compute the expectation, variance, and the second moment of the collection process. The second algorithm utilizes the construction of the base model and computes the same values in polynomial time with respect to $n$ under the uniform drawing distribution, and the third algorithm extends to any general drawing distribution. All algorithms leverage Markov models specifically designed to address computational challenges, ensuring exact computation of the expectation and variance of the collection process. Their implementation uses a dynamic programming approach that follows from the Markov models framework, and their time complexity is analyzed accordingly.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12351v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] From Shallow Waters to Mariana Trench: A Survey of Bio-inspired Underwater Soft Robots</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12353</link><description>arXiv:2601.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample Exploring the ocean environment holds profound significance in areas such as resource exploration and ecological protection. Underwater robots struggle with extreme water pressure and often cause noise and damage to the underwater ecosystem, while bio-inspired soft robots draw inspiration from aquatic creatures to address these challenges. These bio-inspired approaches enable robots to withstand high water pressure, minimize drag, operate with efficient manipulation and sensing systems, and interact with the environment in an eco-friendly manner. Consequently, bio-inspired soft robots have emerged as a promising field for ocean exploration. This paper reviews recent advancements in underwater bio-inspired soft robots, analyses their design considerations when facing different desired functions, bio-inspirations, ambient pressure, temperature, light, and biodiversity , and finally explores the progression from bio-inspired principles to practical applications in the field and suggests potential directions for developing the next generation of underwater soft robots.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12353v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LB-MCTS: Synergizing Large Language Models and Bayesian Optimization for Efficient CASH</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12355</link><description>arXiv:2601.12355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To lower the expertise barrier in machine learning, the AutoML community has focused on the CASH problem, a fundamental challenge that automates the process of algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning. While traditional methods like Bayesian Optimization (BO) struggle with cold-start issues, Large Language Models (LLMs) can mitigate these via semantic priors. However, existing LLM-based optimizers generalize poorly to the high-dimensional, structured CASH space. We propose LB-MCTS, a framework synergizing LLMs and BO within a Monte Carlo Tree Search structure. It maximizes LLM reasoning with Selective Tuning Memory (STM) and explicit exploration-exploitation trade-off. It combines the strengths of both paradigms by dynamically shifting from LLM-driven to BO-driven proposals as data accumulates. Experiments on 104 AMLB datasets demonstrate the superiority of LB-MCTS over the competitive baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12355v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SimpleMatch: A Simple and Strong Baseline for Semantic Correspondence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12357</link><description>arXiv:2601.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in semantic correspondence have been largely driven by the use of pre-trained large-scale models. However, a limitation of these approaches is their dependence on high-resolution input images to achieve optimal performance, which results in considerable computational overhead. In this work, we address a fundamental limitation in current methods: the irreversible fusion of adjacent keypoint features caused by deep downsampling operations. This issue is triggered when semantically distinct keypoints fall within the same downsampled receptive field (e.g., 16x16 patches). To address this issue, we present SimpleMatch, a simple yet effective framework for semantic correspondence that delivers strong performance even at low resolutions. We propose a lightweight upsample decoder that progressively recovers spatial detail by upsampling deep features to 1/4 resolution, and a multi-scale supervised loss that ensures the upsampled features retain discriminative features across different spatial scales. In addition, we introduce sparse matching and window-based localization to optimize training memory usage and reduce it by 51%. At a resolution of 252x252 (3.3x smaller than current SOTA methods), SimpleMatch achieves superior performance with 84.1% PCK@0.1 on the SPair-71k benchmark. We believe this framework provides a practical and efficient baseline for future research in semantic correspondence.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require adaptive behavior planners to navigate unpredictable, real-world environments safely. Traditional behavior trees (BTs) offer structured decision logic but are inherently static and demand labor-intensive manual tuning, limiting their applicability at SAE Level 5 autonomy. This paper presents an agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal vision models (LVMs) to generate and adapt BTs on the fly. A specialized Descriptor agent applies chain-of-symbols prompting to assess scene criticality, a Planner agent constructs high-level sub-goals via in-context learning, and a Generator agent synthesizes executable BT sub-trees in XML format. Integrated into a CARLA+Nav2 simulation, our system triggers only upon baseline BT failure, demonstrating successful navigation around unexpected obstacles (e.g., street blockage) with no human intervention. Compared to a static BT baseline, this approach is a proof-of-concept that extends to diverse driving scenarios.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12358v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection: A Lightweight Defense Against Prompt Injections in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12359</link><description>arXiv:2601.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt injection attacks have become an increasing vulnerability for LLM applications, where adversarial prompts exploit indirect input channels such as emails or user-generated content to circumvent alignment safeguards and induce harmful or unintended outputs. Despite advances in alignment, even state-of-the-art LLMs remain broadly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, underscoring the urgent need for robust, productive, and generalizable detection mechanisms beyond inefficient, model-specific patches. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection (ZEDD), a lightweight, low-engineering-overhead framework that identifies both direct and indirect prompt injection attempts by quantifying semantic shifts in embedding space between benign and suspect inputs. ZEDD operates without requiring access to model internals, prior knowledge of attack types, or task-specific retraining, enabling efficient zero-shot deployment across diverse LLM architectures. Our method uses adversarial-clean prompt pairs and measures embedding drift via cosine similarity to capture subtle adversarial manipulations inherent to real-world injection attacks. To ensure robust evaluation, we assemble and re-annotate the comprehensive LLMail-Inject dataset spanning five injection categories derived from publicly available sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that embedding drift is a robust and transferable signal, outperforming traditional methods in detection accuracy and operational efficiency. With greater than 93% accuracy in classifying prompt injections across model architectures like Llama 3, Qwen 2, and Mistral and a false positive rate of &lt;3%, our approach offers a lightweight, scalable defense layer that integrates into existing LLM pipelines, addressing a critical gap in securing LLM-powered systems to withstand adaptive adversarial threats.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Discovering 100+ Compiler Defects in 72 Hours via LLM-Driven Semantic Logic Recomposition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12360</link><description>arXiv:2601.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compilers constitute the foundational root-of-trust in software supply chains; however, their immense complexity inevitably conceals critical defects. Recent research has attempted to leverage historical bugs to design new mutation operators or fine-tune models to increase program diversity for compiler fuzzing.We observe, however, that bugs manifest primarily based on the semantics of input programs rather than their syntax. Unfortunately, current approaches, whether relying on syntactic mutation or general Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, struggle to preserve the specific semantics found in the logic of bug-triggering programs. Consequently, these critical semantic triggers are often lost, resulting in a limitation of the diversity of generated programs.
  To explicitly reuse such semantics, we propose FeatureFuzz, a compiler fuzzer that combines features to generate programs. We define a feature as a decoupled primitive that encapsulates a natural language description of a bug-prone invariant, such as an out-of-bounds array access, alongside a concrete code witness of its realization. FeatureFuzz operates via a three-stage workflow: it first extracts features from historical bug reports, synthesizes coherent groups of features, and finally instantiates these groups into valid programs for compiler fuzzing.
  We evaluated FeatureFuzz on GCC and LLVM. Over 24-hour campaigns, FeatureFuzz uncovered 167 unique crashes, which is 2.78x more than the second-best fuzzer. Furthermore, through a 72-hour fuzzing campaign, FeatureFuzz identified 106 bugs in GCC and LLVM, 76 of which have already been confirmed by compiler developers, validating the approach's ability to stress-test modern compilers effectively.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12360v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Complexity of Model Checking Second-Order Hyperproperties on Finite Structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12361</link><description>arXiv:2601.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the model checking problem of Hyper2LTL over finite structures. Hyper2LTL is a second-order hyperlogic, that extends the well-studied logic HyperLTL by adding quantification over sets of traces, to express complex hyperproperties such as epistemic and asynchronous hyperproperties. While Hyper2LTL is very expressive, its expressiveness comes with a price, and its general model checking problem is undecidable. This motivates us to study the model checking problem for Hyper2LTL over finite structures -- tree-shaped or acyclic graphs, which are particularly useful for monitoring purposes. We show that Hyper2LTL model checking is decidable on finite structures. It is in PSPACE (in the size of the model) on tree-shaped models and in EXPSPACE on acyclic models. Additionally, we show that for an expressive fragment of Hyper2LTL, namely the Fixpoint Hyper2LTLfp fragment, the model checking problem is much simpler and is P-complete on tree-shaped models and EXP-complete on acyclic models. Last, we present some preliminary results that take into account not only the size of the model, but also the formula size.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12361v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning-Based Framework for Real Time Detection and Early Prediction of Control Valve Stiction in Industrial Control Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12362</link><description>arXiv:2601.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control valve stiction, a friction that prevents smooth valve movement, is a common fault in industrial process systems that causes instability, equipment wear, and higher maintenance costs. Many plants still operate with conventional valves that lack real time monitoring, making early predictions challenging. This study presents a machine learning (ML) framework for detecting and predicting stiction using only routinely collected process signals: the controller output (OP) from control systems and the process variable (PV), such as flow rate. Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To train these models, a data-driven labeling method based on slope ratio analysis was applied to a real oil and gas refinery dataset. The LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy and was able to predict stiction up to four hours in advance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate ML based early prediction of control valve stiction from real industry data. The proposed framework can be integrated into existing control systems to support predictive maintenance, reduce downtime, and avoid unnecessary hardware replacement.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12362v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DepthCropSeg++: Scaling a Crop Segmentation Foundation Model With Depth-Labeled Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12366</link><description>arXiv:2601.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DepthCropSeg++: a foundation model for crop segmentation, capable of segmenting different crop species under open in-field environment. Crop segmentation is a fundamental task for modern agriculture, which closely relates to many downstream tasks such as plant phenotyping, density estimation, and weed control. In the era of foundation models, a number of generic large language and vision models have been developed. These models have demonstrated remarkable real world generalization due to significant model capacity and largescale datasets. However, current crop segmentation models mostly learn from limited data due to expensive pixel-level labelling cost, often performing well only under specific crop types or controlled environment. In this work, we follow the vein of our previous work DepthCropSeg, an almost unsupervised approach to crop segmentation, to scale up a cross-species and crossscene crop segmentation dataset, with 28,406 images across 30+ species and 15 environmental conditions. We also build upon a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation architecture ViT-Adapter architecture, enhance it with dynamic upsampling for improved detail awareness, and train the model with a two-stage selftraining pipeline. To systematically validate model performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments to justify the effectiveness and generalization capabilities across multiple crop datasets. Results demonstrate that DepthCropSeg++ achieves 93.11% mIoU on a comprehensive testing set, outperforming both supervised baselines and general-purpose vision foundation models like Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) by significant margins (+0.36% and +48.57% respectively). The model particularly excels in challenging scenarios including night-time environment (86.90% mIoU), high-density canopies (90.09% mIoU), and unseen crop varieties (90.09% mIoU), indicating a new state of the art for crop segmentation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12366v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] User-to-Vehicle Interaction in Smart Mobility: The GO-DRiVeS Autonomous Ride-Sharing Application</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12367</link><description>arXiv:2601.12367v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are increasingly used for automated survey generation. However, whether they can write surveys like human experts remains unclear. Existing benchmarks focus on fluency or citation accuracy, but none evaluates the core capabilities: retrieving essential papers and organizing them into coherent knowledge structures. We introduce TaxoBench, a diagnostic benchmark derived from 72 highly-cited computer science surveys. We manually extract expert-authored taxonomy trees containing 3,815 precisely categorized citations as ground truth. Our benchmark supports two evaluation modes: Deep Research mode tests end-to-end retrieval and organization given only a topic, while Bottom-Up mode isolates structuring capability by providing the exact papers human experts used. We evaluate 7 leading Deep Research agents and 12 frontier LLMs. Results reveal a dual bottleneck: the best agent recalls only 20.9% of expert-selected papers, and even with perfect input, the best model achieves only 0.31 ARI in organization. Current deep research agents remain far from expert-level survey writing. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/KongLongGeFDU/TaxoBench.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12369v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] CD-TWINSAFE: A ROS-enabled Digital Twin for Scene Understanding and Safety Emerging V2I Technology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12373</link><description>arXiv:2601.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the CD-TWINSAFE is introduced, a V2I-based digital twin for Autonomous Vehicles. The proposed architecture is composed of two stacks running simultaneously, an on-board driving stack that includes a stereo camera for scene understanding, and a digital twin stack that runs an Unreal Engine 5 replica of the scene viewed by the camera as well as returning safety alerts to the cockpit. The on-board stack is implemented on the vehicle side including 2 main autonomous modules; localization and perception. The position and orientation of the ego vehicle are obtained using on-board sensors. Furthermore, the perception module is responsible for processing 20-fps images from stereo camera and understands the scene through two complementary pipelines. The pipeline are working on object detection and feature extraction including object velocity, yaw and the safety metrics time-to-collision and time-headway. The collected data form the driving stack are sent to the infrastructure side through the ROS-enabled architecture in the form of custom ROS2 messages and sent over UDP links that ride a 4G modem for V2I communication.

Abstract: Existing approaches to bias evaluation in large language models (LLMs) trade ecological validity for statistical control, relying on artificial prompts that poorly reflect real-world use, or on naturalistic tasks that lack scale and rigor. We introduce a scalable bias-auditing framework using named entities as probes to measure structural disparities in model behavior. We show that synthetic data reliably reproduces bias patterns observed in natural text, enabling large-scale analysis. Using this approach, we conduct the largest bias audit to date, comprising 1.9 billion data points across multiple entity types, tasks, languages, models, and prompting strategies. Our results reveal systematic biases: models penalize right-wing politicians, favor left-wing politicians, prefer Western and wealthy nations over the Global South, favor Western companies, and penalize firms in the defense and pharmaceutical sectors. While instruction tuning reduces bias, increasing model scale amplifies it, and prompting in Chinese or Russian does not attenuate Western-aligned preferences. These results indicate that LLMs should undergo rigorous auditing before deployment in high-stakes applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12374v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LiQSS: Post-Transformer Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space Tensor Networks for Real-Time 6G</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12375</link><description>arXiv:2601.12375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proactive and agentic control in Sixth-Generation (6G) Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) requires control-grade prediction under stringent Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) latency and computational constraints. While Transformer-based models are effective for sequence modeling, their quadratic complexity limits scalability in Near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) analytics. This paper investigates a post-Transformer design paradigm for efficient radio telemetry forecasting. We propose a quantum-inspired many-body state-space tensor network that replaces self-attention with stable structured state-space dynamics kernels, enabling linear-time sequence modeling. Tensor-network factorizations in the form of Tensor Train (TT) / Matrix Product State (MPS) representations are employed to reduce parameterization and data movement in both input projections and prediction heads, while lightweight channel gating and mixing layers capture non-stationary cross-Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dependencies. The proposed model is instantiated as an agentic perceive-predict xApp and evaluated on a bespoke O-RAN KPI time-series dataset comprising 59,441 sliding windows across 13 KPIs, using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) forecasting as a representative use case. Our proposed Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space (LiQSS) model is 10.8x-15.8x smaller and approximately 1.4x faster than prior structured state-space baselines. Relative to Transformer-based models, LiQSS achieves up to a 155x reduction in parameter count and up to 2.74x faster inference, without sacrificing forecasting accuracy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12375v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] LR-DWM: Efficient Watermarking for Diffusion Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12376</link><description>arXiv:2601.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking (WM) is a critical mechanism for detecting and attributing AI-generated content. Current WM methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly tailored for autoregressive (AR) models: They rely on tokens being generated sequentially, and embed stable signals within the generated sequence based on the previously sampled text. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) generate text via non-sequential iterative denoising, which requires significant modification to use WM methods designed for AR models. Recent work proposed to watermark DLMs by inverting the process when needed, but suffers significant computational or memory overhead. We introduce Left-Right Diffusion Watermarking (LR-DWM), a scheme that biases the generated token based on both left and right neighbors, when they are available. LR-DWM incurs minimal runtime and memory overhead, remaining close to the non-watermarked baseline DLM while enabling reliable statistical detection under standard evaluation settings. Our results demonstrate that DLMs can be watermarked efficiently, achieving high detectability with negligible computational and memory overhead.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12376v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] R-VoxelMap: Accurate Voxel Mapping with Recursive Plane Fitting for Online LiDAR Odometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12377</link><description>arXiv:2601.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes R-VoxelMap, a novel voxel mapping method that constructs accurate voxel maps using a geometry-driven recursive plane fitting strategy to enhance the localization accuracy of online LiDAR odometry. VoxelMap and its variants typically fit and check planes using all points in a voxel, which may lead to plane parameter deviation caused by outliers, over segmentation of large planes, and incorrect merging across different physical planes. To address these issues, R-VoxelMap utilizes a geometry-driven recursive construction strategy based on an outlier detect-and-reuse pipeline. Specifically, for each voxel, accurate planes are first fitted while separating outliers using random sample consensus (RANSAC). The remaining outliers are then propagated to deeper octree levels for recursive processing, ensuring a detailed representation of the environment. In addition, a point distribution-based validity check algorithm is devised to prevent erroneous plane merging. Extensive experiments on diverse open-source LiDAR(-inertial) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) datasets validate that our method achieves higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art approaches, with comparable efficiency and memory usage.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are a type of image that contains abundant spectral information. As a type of real-world data, the high-dimensional spectra in hyperspectral images are actually determined by only a few factors, such as chemical composition and illumination. Thus, spectra in hyperspectral images are highly likely to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. Based on the hyperspectral manifold hypothesis, we propose a novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method (named ScoreAD) that leverages the time-dependent gradient field of the data distribution (i.e., the score), as learned by a score-based generative model (SGM). Our method first trains the SGM on the entire set of spectra from the hyperspectral image. At test time, each spectrum is passed through a perturbation kernel, and the resulting perturbed spectrum is fed into the trained SGM to obtain the estimated score. The manifold hypothesis of HSIs posits that background spectra reside on one or more low-dimensional manifolds. Conversely, anomalous spectra, owing to their unique spectral signatures, are considered outliers that do not conform to the background manifold. Based on this fundamental discrepancy in their manifold distributions, we leverage a generative SGM to achieve hyperspectral anomaly detection. Experiments on the four hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/jiahuisheng/ScoreAD.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12379v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Statistical-Neural Interaction Networks for Interpretable Mixed-Type Data Imputation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12380</link><description>arXiv:2601.12380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world tabular databases routinely combine continuous measurements and categorical records, yet missing entries are pervasive and can distort downstream analysis. We propose Statistical-Neural Interaction (SNI), an interpretable mixed-type imputation framework that couples correlation-derived statistical priors with neural feature attention through a Controllable-Prior Feature Attention (CPFA) module. CPFA learns head-wise prior-strength coefficients $\{\lambda_h\}$ that softly regularize attention toward the prior while allowing data-driven deviations when nonlinear patterns appear to be present in the data. Beyond imputation, SNI aggregates attention maps into a directed feature-dependency matrix that summarizes which variables the imputer relied on, without requiring post-hoc explainers. We evaluate SNI against six baselines (Mean/Mode, MICE, KNN, MissForest, GAIN, MIWAE) on six datasets spanning ICU monitoring, population surveys, socio-economic statistics, and engineering applications. Under MCAR/strict-MAR at 30\% missingness, SNI is generally competitive on continuous metrics but is often outperformed by accuracy-first baselines (MissForest, MIWAE) on categorical variables; in return, it provides intrinsic dependency diagnostics and explicit statistical-neural trade-off parameters. We additionally report MNAR stress tests (with a mask-aware variant) and discuss computational cost, limitations -- particularly for severely imbalanced categorical targets -- and deployment scenarios where interpretability may justify the trade-off.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12380v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Hierarchical Benchmark of Foundation Models for Dermatology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12382</link><description>arXiv:2601.12382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have transformed medical image analysis by providing robust feature representations that reduce the need for large-scale task-specific training. However, current benchmarks in dermatology often reduce the complex diagnostic taxonomy to flat, binary classification tasks, such as distinguishing melanoma from benign nevi. This oversimplification obscures a model's ability to perform fine-grained differential diagnoses, which is critical for clinical workflow integration. This study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from ten foundation models, spanning general computer vision, general medical imaging, and dermatology-specific domains, for hierarchical skin lesion classification. Using the DERM12345 dataset, which comprises 40 lesion subclasses, we calculated frozen embeddings and trained lightweight adapter models using a five-fold cross-validation. We introduce a hierarchical evaluation framework that assesses performance across four levels of clinical granularity: 40 Subclasses, 15 Main Classes, 2 and 4 Superclasses, and Binary Malignancy. Our results reveal a "granularity gap" in model capabilities: MedImageInsights achieved the strongest overall performance (97.52% weighted F1-Score on Binary Malignancy detection) but declined to 65.50% on fine-grained 40-class subtype classification. Conversely, MedSigLip (69.79%) and dermatology-specific models (Derm Foundation and MONET) excelled at fine-grained 40-class subtype discrimination while achieving lower overall performance than MedImageInsights on broader classification tasks. Our findings suggest that while general medical foundation models are highly effective for high-level screening, specialized modeling strategies are necessary for the granular distinctions required in diagnostic support systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12382v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Context-Free Grammar Inference for Complex Programming Languages in Black Box Settings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12385</link><description>arXiv:2601.12385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grammar inference for complex programming languages remains a significant challenge, as existing approaches fail to scale to real world datasets within practical time constraints. In our experiments, none of the state-of-the-art tools, including Arvada, Treevada and Kedavra were able to infer grammars for complex languages such as C, C++, and Java within 48 hours. Arvada and Treevada perform grammar inference directly on full-length input examples, which proves inefficient for large files commonly found in such languages. While Kedavra introduces data decomposition to create shorter examples for grammar inference, its lexical analysis still relies on the original inputs. Additionally, its strict no-overgeneralization constraint limits the construction of complex grammars.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Crucio, which builds a decomposition forest to extract short examples for lexical and grammar inference via a distributional matrix. Experimental results show that Crucio is the only method capable of successfully inferring grammars for complex programming languages (where the number of nonterminals is up to 23x greater than in prior benchmarks) within reasonable time limits. On the prior simple benchmark, Crucio achieves an average recall improvement of 1.37x and 1.19x over Treevada and Kedavra, respectively, and improves F1 scores by 1.21x and 1.13x.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12385v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] NADIR: Differential Attention Flow for Non-Autoregressive Transliteration in Indic Languages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12389</link><description>arXiv:2601.12389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we argue that not all sequence-to-sequence tasks require the strong inductive biases of autoregressive (AR) models. Tasks like multilingual transliteration, code refactoring, grammatical correction or text normalization often rely on local dependencies where the full modeling capacity of AR models can be overkill, creating a trade-off between their high accuracy and high inference latency. While non-autoregressive (NAR) models offer speed, they typically suffer from hallucinations and poor length control. To explore this trade-off, we focus on the multilingual transliteration task in Indic languages and introduce NADIR, a novel NAR architecture designed to strike a balance between speed and accuracy. NADIR integrates a Differential Transformer and a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism, enabling it to robustly model complex character mappings without sequential dependencies. NADIR achieves over a 13x speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art AR baseline. It maintains a competitive mean Character Error Rate of 15.78%, compared to 14.44% for the AR model and 21.88% for a standard NAR equivalent. Importantly, NADIR reduces Repetition errors by 49.53%, Substitution errors by 24.45%, Omission errors by 32.92%, and Insertion errors by 16.87%. This work provides a practical blueprint for building fast and reliable NAR systems, effectively bridging the gap between AR accuracy and the demands of real-time, large-scale deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12389v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Auditing Meta and TikTok Research API Data Access under Article 40(12) of the Digital Services Act</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12390</link><description>arXiv:2601.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Article 40(12) of the Digital Services Act (DSA) requires Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) to provide vetted researchers with access to publicly accessible data. While prior work has identified shortcomings of platform-provided data access mechanisms, existing research has not quantitatively assessed data quality and completeness in Research APIs across platforms, nor systematically mapped how current access provisions fall short. This paper presents a systematic audit of research access modalities by comparing data obtained through platform Research APIs with data collected about the same platforms' user-visible public information environment (PIE). Focusing on two major platform APIs, the TikTok Research API and the Meta Content Library, we reconstruct full information feeds for two controlled sockpuppet accounts during two election periods and benchmark these against the data retrievable for the same posts through the corresponding Research APIs. Our findings show systematic data loss through three classes of platform-imposed mechanisms: scope narrowing, metadata stripping, and operational restrictions. Together, these mechanisms implement overlapping filters that exclude large portions of the platform PIE (up to approximately 50 percent), strip essential contextual metadata (up to approximately 83 percent), and impose severe technical constraints for researchers (down to approximately 1000 requests per day). Viewed through a data quality lens, these filters primarily undermine completeness, resulting in a structurally biased representation of platform activity. We conclude that, in their current form, the Meta and TikTok Research APIs fall short of supporting meaningful, independent auditing of systemic risks as envisioned under the DSA.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12390v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Class-Partitioned VQ-VAE and Latent Flow Matching for Point Cloud Scene Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12391</link><description>arXiv:2601.12391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most 3D scene generation methods are limited to only generating object bounding box parameters while newer diffusion methods also generate class labels and latent features. Using object size or latent feature, they then retrieve objects from a predefined database. For complex scenes of varied, multi-categorical objects, diffusion-based latents cannot be effectively decoded by current autoencoders into the correct point cloud objects which agree with target classes. We introduce a Class-Partitioned Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CPVQ-VAE) that is trained to effectively decode object latent features, by employing a pioneering $\textit{class-partitioned codebook}$ where codevectors are labeled by class. To address the problem of $\textit{codebook collapse}$, we propose a $\textit{class-aware}$ running average update which reinitializes dead codevectors within each partition. During inference, object features and class labels, both generated by a Latent-space Flow Matching Model (LFMM) designed specifically for scene generation, are consumed by the CPVQ-VAE. The CPVQ-VAE's class-aware inverse look-up then maps generated latents to codebook entries that are decoded to class-specific point cloud shapes. Thereby, we achieve pure point cloud generation without relying on an external objects database for retrieval. Extensive experiments reveal that our method reliably recovers plausible point cloud scenes, with up to 70.4% and 72.3% reduction in Chamfer and Point2Mesh errors on complex living room scenes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12391v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Psych\=eChat: An Empathic Framework Focused on Emotion Shift Tracking and Safety Risk Analysis in Psychological Counseling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12392</link><description>arXiv:2601.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable advancements in psychological counseling. However, existing models generally do not explicitly model seekers' emotion shifts across counseling sessions, a core focus in classical psychological schools. Moreover, how to align counselor models' responses with these emotion shifts while proactively mitigating safety risks remains underexplored. To bridge these gaps, we propose Psych\=eChat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling. Specifically, we employ interactive role-playing to synthesize counselor--seeker dialogues, incorporating two modules: Emotion Management Module, to capture seekers' current emotions and emotion shifts; and Risk Control Module, to anticipate seekers' subsequent reactions and identify potential risks. Furthermore, we introduce two modeling paradigms. The Agent Mode structures emotion management, risk control, and counselor responses into a collaborative multi-agent pipeline. The LLM Mode integrates these stages into a unified chain-of-thought for end-to-end inference, balancing efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments, including interactive scoring, dialogue-level evaluation, and human assessment, demonstrate that Psych\=eChat outperforms existing methods for emotional insight and safety control.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12392v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] $2$-quasi-perfect Lee codes and abelian Ramanujan graphs: a new construction and relationship</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12393</link><description>arXiv:2601.12393v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Two physical-layer mechanisms for achieving user-side differential privacy in communication systems are proposed. Focusing on binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, differential privacy (DP) is first studied under a deterministic phase rotation applied on the BPSK modulation at the transmitter, while the receiver is assumed to be unaware of the rotation angle. In this setting, privacy is achieved through an effective reduction in the decision distance, resulting in a controlled increase in the bit error rate (BER) without explicit noise injection. Next, a BPSK transmission scheme with intentionally induced inter-symbol interference (ISI) is studied, where the receiver is likewise unaware of the deterministic timing offset that generates the ISI. Unlike the rotated BPSK scheme, the DP obtained via ISI is shown to depend explicitly on the input data distribution. In particular, numerical results demonstrate that, for a fixed ISI parameter, the privacy loss is maximized when the binary input symbols are equiprobable. While conventional DP mechanisms rely on artificially added noise, often incurring additional energy or communication costs, it is shown that structured modifications, such as modulation rotation or induced ISI inherent to realistic communication channels can itself provide DP guarantees. While the analysis focuses on deterministic transmitter modifications unknown to the receiver, it is noted that real-world devices naturally introduce unintentional rotations or ISI due to hardware nonidealities and implementation errors. These effects can therefore provide a level of privacy without requiring explicit noise injection. Hence, it is possible to avoid deliberately perturbing the data, instead leveraging inherent device imperfections to achieve privacy guarantees with no additional privacy cost.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12394v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VR$^2$: A Co-Located Dual-Headset Platform for Touch-Enabled Human-Robot Interaction Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12395</link><description>arXiv:2601.12395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Touch-rich human-robot interaction (HRI) is difficult to study: building and programming physical robots is costly and slow, while VR-based robot prototypes often remove physical contact or break the tight coupling between an agent's body and the user's felt touch. We present VR2VR, a co-located dual VR-headset platform for HRI research in which a participant and a hidden operator share the same physical space while experiencing different virtual embodiments. The participant sees an expressive virtual robot that interacts face-to-face in a shared virtual environment. In real time, the robot's upper-body gestures, head and gaze behaviors, and facial expressions are mapped from the operator's tracked motion and face signals. Because the operator is physically co-present and calibrated into the same coordinate frame, the operator can also physically touch the participant, enabling the participant to perceive robot touch aligned with the robot's hands; finger and hand motion are mapped to the robot using inverse kinematics to support precise contact. Beyond faithful motion retargeting for limb teleoperation, our VR2VR system supports experimental control by retargeting or selectively enabling nonverbal channels (e.g., head only vs. head+eyes vs. head+eyes+facial expressions) while keeping physical interaction constant. We detail the system design, calibration workflow, and safety considerations, and demonstrate the platform through a touch-based Wizard-of-Oz HRI study, illustrating how VR2VR lowers barriers for rapidly prototyping and rigorously evaluating embodied, touch-centric robot behaviors.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12395v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Diverse Skills for Behavior Models with Mixture of Experts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12397</link><description>arXiv:2601.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning has demonstrated strong performance in robotic manipulation by learning from large-scale human demonstrations. While existing models excel at single-task learning, it is observed in practical applications that their performance degrades in the multi-task setting, where interference across tasks leads to an averaging effect. To address this issue, we propose to learn diverse skills for behavior models with Mixture of Experts, referred to as Di-BM. Di-BM associates each expert with a distinct observation distribution, enabling experts to specialize in sub-regions of the observation space. Specifically, we employ energy-based models to represent expert-specific observation distributions and jointly train them alongside the corresponding action models. Our approach is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into standard imitation learning methods. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Di-BM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, fine-tuning the pretrained Di-BM on novel tasks exhibits superior data efficiency and the reusable of expert-learned knowledge.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-tuning large-scale generative models, such as diffusion and flow models, to align with complex human preferences and user-specified tasks. A fundamental limitation remains \textit{the curse of diversity collapse}, where the objective formulation and optimization landscape inherently collapse the policy to a Dirac delta distribution. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}ive\textbf{R}sity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Reinforcement \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning for Versatile Image Generation), an innovative framework that systematically incentivizes output diversity throughout the on-policy fine-tuning process, reconciling strong task alignment with high generation diversity to enhance versatility essential for applications that demand diverse candidate generations. We approach the problem across three representative perspectives: i) \textbf{sampling} a reward-concentrated subset that filters out reward outliers to prevent premature collapse; ii) \textbf{prompting} with stochastic variations to expand the conditioning space, and iii) \textbf{optimization} of the intra-group diversity with a potential-based reward shaping mechanism. Experimental results show that DRIFT achieves superior Pareto dominance regarding task alignment and generation diversity, yielding a $ 9.08\%\!\sim\! 43.46\%$ increase in diversity at equivalent alignment levels and a $ 59.65\% \!\sim\! 65.86\%$ increase in alignment at equivalent levels of diversity.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12401v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Weaknesses of Facial Emotion Recognition Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12402</link><description>arXiv:2601.12402v1 Announce Type: new

Three of the most interesting and best solutions are selected, followed by the selection of three datasets that stood out for the diversity and number of images in them.

This reveals weaknesses in existing solutions, including differences between datasets, unequal levels of difficulty in recognizing certain emotions and the challenges in differentiating between closely related emotions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12402v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] De-Anonymization at Scale via Tournament-Style Attribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12407</link><description>arXiv:2601.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLMs rapidly advance and enter real-world use, their privacy implications are increasingly important. We study an authorship de-anonymization threat: using LLMs to link anonymous documents to their authors, potentially compromising settings such as double-blind peer review.
  We propose De-Anonymization at Scale (DAS), a large language model-based method for attributing authorship among tens of thousands of candidate texts. DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms. On standard authorship benchmarks (Enron emails and blog posts), DAS also improves both accuracy and scalability over prior approaches, highlighting a new LLM-enabled de-anonymization vulnerability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Are LLMs Smarter Than Chimpanzees? An Evaluation on Perspective Taking and Knowledge State Estimation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12410</link><description>arXiv:2601.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive anthropology suggests that the distinction of human intelligence lies in the ability to infer other individuals' knowledge states and understand their intentions. In comparison, our closest animal relative, chimpanzees, lack the capacity to do so. With this paper, we aim to evaluate LLM performance in the area of knowledge state tracking and estimation. We design two tasks to test (1) if LLMs can detect when story characters, through their actions, demonstrate knowledge they should not possess, and (2) if LLMs can predict story characters' next actions based on their own knowledge vs. objective truths they do not know. Results reveal that most current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve near-random performance on both tasks, and are substantially inferior to humans. We argue future LLM research should place more weight on the abilities of knowledge estimation and intention understanding.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12410v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Orthogonalized Policy Optimization:Decoupling Sampling Geometry from Optimization Geometry in RLHF</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12415</link><description>arXiv:2601.12415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent alignment methods for large language models, including PPO, DPO, and IPO, are often presented as distinct algorithms. In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12415v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] RLMiner: Finding the Most Frequent k-sized Subgraph via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12416</link><description>arXiv:2601.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ in a target graph is a fundamental graph mining problem with direct implications for Web-related data mining and social network analysis. Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12416v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Legal experts disagree with rationale extraction techniques for explaining ECtHR case outcome classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12419</link><description>arXiv:2601.12419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability is critical for applications of large language models in the legal domain which requires trust and transparency. While some studies develop task-specific approaches, other use the classification model's parameters to explain the decisions. However, which technique explains the legal outcome prediction best remains an open question. To address this challenge, we propose a comparative analysis framework for model-agnostic interpretability techniques. Among these, we employ two rationale extraction methods, which justify outcomes with human-interpretable and concise text fragments (i.e., rationales) from the given input text. We conduct comparison by evaluating faithfulness-via normalized sufficiency and comprehensiveness metrics along with plausibility-by asking legal experts to evaluate extracted rationales. We further assess the feasibility of LLM-as-a-Judge using legal expert evaluation results. We show that the model's "reasons" for predicting a violation differ substantially from those of legal experts, despite highly promising quantitative analysis results and reasonable downstream classification performance.

Abstract: Stereo vision between images faces a range of challenges, including occlusions, motion, and camera distortions, across applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and face analysis. Due to parameter sensitivity, further complications arise for stereo matching with sparse features, such as facial landmarks. To overcome this ill-posedness and enable unsupervised sparse matching, we consider line constraints of the camera geometry from an optimal transport (OT) viewpoint. Formulating camera-projected points as (half)lines, we propose the use of the classical epipolar distance as well as a 3D ray distance to quantify matching quality. Employing these distances as a cost function of a (partial) OT problem, we arrive at efficiently solvable assignment problems. Moreover, we extend our approach to unsupervised object matching by formulating it as a hierarchical OT problem. The resulting algorithms allow for efficient feature and object matching, as demonstrated in our numerical experiments. Here, we focus on applications in facial analysis, where we aim to match distinct landmarking conventions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12423v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Graph Attention Networks with Physical Constraints for Anomaly Detection</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12426</link><description>arXiv:2601.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water distribution systems (WDSs) face increasing cyber-physical risks, which make reliable anomaly detection essential.

Abstract: Cyclic codes are an important subclass of linear codes with wide applications in communication systems and data storage systems. In 2013, Ding and Helleseth presented nine open problems on optimal ternary cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}$. While the first two and the sixth problems have been fully solved, others remain open. In this paper, we advance the study of the third and fourth open problems by providing the first counterexamples to both and constructing two families of optimal codes under certain conditions, thereby partially solving the third problem. Furthermore, we investigate the cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}$ where $e(3^h\pm 1)\equiv\frac{3^m-a}{2}\pmod{3^m-1}$ and $a$ is odd. For $a\equiv 3\pmod{4}$, we present two new families of optimal codes with parameters $[3^m-1,3^m-1-2m,4]$, generalizing known constructions. For $a\equiv 1\pmod{4}$, we obtain several nonexistence results on optimal codes $\mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}$ with the aforementioned parameters revealing the constraints of such codes.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12427v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] ReWorld: Multi-Dimensional Reward Modeling for Embodied World Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12428</link><description>arXiv:2601.12428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, video-based world models that learn to simulate the dynamics have gained increasing attention in robot learning. However, current approaches primarily emphasize visual generative quality while overlooking physical fidelity, dynamic consistency, and task logic, especially for contact-rich manipulation tasks, which limits their applicability to downstream tasks. To this end, we introduce ReWorld, a framework aimed to employ reinforcement learning to align the video-based embodied world models with physical realism, task completion capability, embodiment plausibility and visual quality. Specifically, we first construct a large-scale (~235K) video preference dataset and employ it to train a hierarchical reward model designed to capture multi-dimensional reward consistent with human preferences. We further propose a practical alignment algorithm that post-trains flow-based world models using this reward through a computationally efficient PPO-style algorithm. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that ReWorld significantly improves the physical fidelity, logical coherence, embodiment and visual quality of generated rollouts, outperforming previous methods.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] System-Mediated Attention Imbalances Make Vision-Language Models Say Yes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12430</link><description>arXiv:2601.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) hallucination is commonly linked to imbalanced allocation of attention across input modalities: system, image and text. However, existing mitigation strategies tend towards an image-centric interpretation of these imbalances, often prioritising increased image attention while giving less consideration to the roles of the other modalities. In this study, we evaluate a more holistic, system-mediated account, which attributes these imbalances to functionally redundant system weights that reduce attention to image and textual inputs. We show that this framework offers a useful empirical perspective on the yes-bias, a common form of hallucination in which VLMs indiscriminately respond 'yes'. Causally redistributing attention from the system modality to image and textual inputs substantially suppresses this bias, often outperforming existing approaches. We further present evidence suggesting that system-mediated attention imbalances contribute to the yes-bias by encouraging a default reliance on coarse input representations, which are effective for some tasks but ill-suited to others. Taken together, these findings firmly establish system attention as a key factor in VLM hallucination and highlight its potential as a lever for mitigation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SkeFi: Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer for Wireless Skeleton-Based Action Recognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12432</link><description>arXiv:2601.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition leverages human pose keypoints to categorize human actions, which shows superior generalization and interoperability compared to regular end-to-end action recognition. Existing solutions use RGB cameras to annotate skeletal keypoints, but their performance declines in dark environments and raises privacy concerns, limiting their use in smart homes and hospitals. This paper explores non-invasive wireless sensors, i.e., LiDAR and mmWave, to mitigate these challenges as a feasible alternative. Two problems are addressed: (1) insufficient data on wireless sensor modality to train an accurate skeleton estimation model, and (2) skeletal keypoints derived from wireless sensors are noisier than RGB, causing great difficulties for subsequent action recognition models. Our work, SkeFi, overcomes these gaps through a novel cross-modal knowledge transfer method acquired from the data-rich RGB modality. We propose the enhanced Temporal Correlation Adaptive Graph Convolution (TC-AGC) with frame interactive enhancement to overcome the noise from missing or inconsecutive frames. Additionally, our research underscores the effectiveness of enhancing multiscale temporal modeling through dual temporal convolution. By integrating TC-AGC with temporal modeling for cross-modal transfer, our framework can extract accurate poses and actions from noisy wireless sensors. Experiments demonstrate that SkeFi realizes state-of-the-art performances on mmWave and LiDAR.

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges constitute the single largest vector of systemic risk in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), accounting for over \$2.8 billion in losses since 2021. The fundamental vulnerability lies in the binary nature of existing bridge security models: a bridge is either fully operational or catastrophically compromised, with no intermediate state to contain partial failures. We present ASAS-BridgeAMM, a bridge-coupled automated market maker that introduces Contained Degradation: a formally specified operational state where the system gracefully degrades functionality in response to adversarial signals. By treating cross-chain message latency as a quantifiable execution risk, the protocol dynamically adjusts collateral haircuts, slippage bounds, and withdrawal limits. Across 18 months of historical replay on Ethereum and two auxiliary chains, ASAS-BridgeAMM reduces worst-case bridge-induced insolvency by 73% relative to baseline mint-and-burn architectures, while preserving 104.5% of transaction volume during stress periods. In rigorous adversarial simulations involving delayed finality, oracle manipulation, and liquidity griefing, the protocol maintains solvency with probability $&gt;0.9999$ and bounds per-epoch bad debt to $&lt;0.2%$ of total collateral. We provide a reference implementation in Solidity and formally prove safety (bounded debt), liveness (settlement completion), and manipulation resistance under a Byzantine relayer model.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12434v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Constraint-Aware Neurosymbolic Uncertainty Quantification with Bayesian Deep Learning for Scientific Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12442</link><description>arXiv:2601.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications require models that deliver trustworthy uncertainty estimates while respecting domain constraints. Existing uncertainty quantification methods lack mechanisms to incorporate symbolic scientific knowledge, while neurosymbolic approaches operate deterministically without principled uncertainty modeling. We introduce the Constraint-Aware Neurosymbolic Uncertainty Framework (CANUF), unifying Bayesian deep learning with differentiable symbolic reasoning. The architecture comprises three components: automated constraint extraction from scientific literature, probabilistic neural backbone with variational inference, and differentiable constraint satisfaction layer ensuring physical consistency. Experiments on Materials Project (140,000+ materials), QM9 molecular properties, and climate benchmarks show CANUF reduces Expected Calibration Error by 34.7% versus Bayesian neural networks while maintaining 99.2% constraint satisfaction. Ablations reveal constraint-guided recalibration contributes 18.3% performance gain, with constraint extraction achieving 91.4% precision. CANUF provides the first end-to-end differentiable pipeline simultaneously addressing uncertainty quantification, constraint satisfaction, and interpretable explanations for scientific predictions.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Defense in Vision-Language Models: An Overview</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12443</link><description>arXiv:2601.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of Vision Language Models (VLMs, e.g. CLIP) has raised concerns about their vulnerability to sophisticated and imperceptible adversarial attacks. These attacks could compromise model performance and system security in cross-modal tasks. To address this challenge, three main defense paradigms have been proposed: Training-time Defense, Test-time Adaptation Defense, and Training-free Defense. Training-time Defense involves modifying the training process, typically through adversarial fine-tuning to improve the robustness to adversarial examples. While effective, this approach requires substantial computational resources and may not generalize across all adversarial attacks. Test-time Adaptation Defense focuses on adapting the model at inference time by updating its parameters to handle unlabeled adversarial examples, offering flexibility but often at the cost of increased complexity and computational overhead. Training-free Defense avoids modifying the model itself, instead focusing on altering the adversarial inputs or their feature embeddings, which enforces input perturbations to mitigate the impact of attacks without additional training. This survey reviews the latest advancements in adversarial defense strategies for VLMs, highlighting the strengths and limitations of such approaches and discussing ongoing challenges in enhancing the robustness of VLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12443v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large Language Model for OWL Proofs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12444</link><description>arXiv:2601.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks such as deduction has been widely investigated in recent years. Yet, their capacity to generate proofs-faithful, human-readable explanations of why conclusions follow-remains largely under explored. In this work, we study proof generation in the context of OWL ontologies, which are widely adopted for representing and reasoning over complex knowledge, by developing an automated dataset construction and evaluation framework. Our evaluation encompassing three sequential tasks for complete proving: Extraction, Simplification, and Explanation, as well as an additional task of assessing Logic Completeness of the premise. Through extensive experiments on widely used reasoning LLMs, we achieve important findings including: (1) Some models achieve overall strong results but remain limited on complex cases; (2) Logical complexity, rather than representation format (formal logic language versus natural language), is the dominant factor shaping LLM performance; and (3) Noise and incompleteness in input data substantially diminish LLMs' performance. Together, these results underscore both the promise of LLMs for explanation with rigorous logics and the gap of supporting resilient reasoning under complex or imperfect conditions.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed institutions without centralizing sensitive data; however, ensuring algorithmic fairness across heterogeneous data distributions while preserving privacy remains fundamentally unresolved. This paper introduces CryptoFair-FL, a novel cryptographic framework providing the first verifiable fairness guarantees for federated learning systems under formal security definitions. The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \log n) while maintaining (\dparam, \deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging. The framework successfully defends against attribute inference attacks, maintaining adversarial success probability below 0.05 across all tested configurations. These results establish a practical pathway for deploying fairness-aware federated learning in regulated industries requiring both privacy protection and algorithmic accountability.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12447v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Evaluating Large Language Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection in Aerospace Software</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12448</link><description>arXiv:2601.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of aerospace software systems. Although large language models (LLMs) provide a promising training-free alternative to unsupervised approaches, their effectiveness in aerospace settings remains under-examined because of complex telemetry, misaligned evaluation metrics, and the absence of domain knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce ATSADBench, the first benchmark for aerospace TSAD. ATSADBench comprises nine tasks that combine three pattern-wise anomaly types, univariate and multivariate signals, and both in-loop and out-of-loop feedback scenarios, yielding 108,000 data points. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under two paradigms: Direct, which labels anomalies within sliding windows, and Prediction-Based, which detects anomalies from prediction errors. To reflect operational needs, we reformulate evaluation at the window level and propose three user-oriented metrics: Alarm Accuracy (AA), Alarm Latency (AL), and Alarm Contiguity (AC), which quantify alarm correctness, timeliness, and credibility. We further examine two enhancement strategies, few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to inject domain knowledge. The evaluation results show that (1) LLMs perform well on univariate tasks but struggle with multivariate telemetry, (2) their AA and AC on multivariate tasks approach random guessing, (3) few-shot learning provides modest gains whereas RAG offers no significant improvement, and (4) in practice LLMs can detect true anomaly onsets yet sometimes raise false alarms, which few-shot prompting mitigates but RAG exacerbates. These findings offer guidance for future LLM-based TSAD in aerospace software.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12448v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] AgenTRIM: Tool Risk Mitigation for Agentic AI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12449</link><description>arXiv:2601.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are autonomous systems that combine LLMs with external tools to solve complex tasks. While such tools extend capability, improper tool permissions introduce security risks such as indirect prompt injection and tool misuse. We characterize these failures as unbalanced tool-driven agency. Agents may retain unnecessary permissions (excessive agency) or fail to invoke required tools (insufficient agency), amplifying the attack surface and reducing performance. We introduce AgenTRIM, a framework for detecting and mitigating tool-driven agency risks without altering an agent's internal reasoning. AgenTRIM addresses these risks through complementary offline and online phases. Offline, AgenTRIM reconstructs and verifies the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces. At runtime, it enforces per-step least-privilege tool access through adaptive filtering and status-aware validation of tool calls. Evaluating on the AgentDojo benchmark, AgenTRIM substantially reduces attack success while maintaining high task performance. Additional experiments show robustness to description-based attacks and effective enforcement of explicit safety policies. Together, these results demonstrate that AgenTRIM provides a practical, capability-preserving approach to safer tool use in LLM-based agents.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12449v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Bringing Data Transformations Near-Memory for Low-Latency Analytics in HTAP Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12456</link><description>arXiv:2601.12456v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The demand of customized large language models (LLMs) has led to commercial LLMs offering black-box fine-tuning APIs, yet this convenience introduces a critical security loophole: attackers could jailbreak the LLMs by fine-tuning them with malicious data. Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., "bruaf") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings. Results show that TrojanPraise achieves a maximum attack success rate of 95.88% while evading moderation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12460v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Large-scale EM Benchmark for Multi-Organelle Instance Segmentation in the Wild</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12464</link><description>arXiv:2601.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate instance-level segmentation of organelles in electron microscopy (EM) is critical for quantitative analysis of subcellular morphology and inter-organelle interactions. However, current benchmarks, based on small, curated datasets, fail to capture the inherent heterogeneity and large spatial context of in-the-wild EM data, imposing fundamental limitations on current patch-based methods. To address these limitations, we developed a large-scale, multi-source benchmark for multi-organelle instance segmentation, comprising over 100,000 2D EM images across variety cell types and five organelle classes that capture real-world variability. Dataset annotations were generated by our designed connectivity-aware Label Propagation Algorithm (3D LPA) with expert refinement. We further benchmarked several state-of-the-art models, including U-Net, SAM variants, and Mask2Former. Our results show several limitations: current models struggle to generalize across heterogeneous EM data and perform poorly on organelles with global, distributed morphologies (e.g., Endoplasmic Reticulum). These findings underscore the fundamental mismatch between local-context models and the challenge of modeling long-range structural continuity in the presence of real-world variability. The benchmark dataset and labeling tool will be publicly released soon.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12464v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Incentivizing In-depth Reasoning over Long Contexts with Process Advantage Shaping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12465</link><description>arXiv:2601.12465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in enhancing LLMs short-context reasoning, but its performance degrades in long-context scenarios that require both precise grounding and robust long-range reasoning. We identify the "almost-there" phenomenon in long-context reasoning, where trajectories are largely correct but fail at the final step, and attribute this failure to two factors: (1) the lack of high reasoning density in long-context QA data that push LLMs beyond mere grounding toward sophisticated multi-hop reasoning; and (2) the loss of valuable learning signals during long-context RL training due to the indiscriminate penalization of partially correct trajectories with incorrect outcomes. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose DeepReasonQA, a KG-driven synthesis framework that controllably constructs high-difficulty, multi-hop long-context QA pairs with inherent reasoning chains. Building on this, we introduce Long-context Process Advantage Shaping (LongPAS), a simple yet effective method that performs fine-grained credit assignment by evaluating reasoning steps along Validity and Relevance dimensions, which captures critical learning signals from "almost-there" trajectories. Experiments on three long-context reasoning benchmarks show that our approach substantially outperforms RLVR baselines and matches frontier LLMs while using far fewer parameters. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our methods in strengthening long-context reasoning while maintaining stable RL training.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12465v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Patch-Level Tokenization with CNN Encoders and Attention for Improved Transformer Time-Series Forecasting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12467</link><description>arXiv:2601.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown strong performance in time-series forecasting by leveraging self-attention to model long-range temporal dependencies. However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines. The results highlight the importance of structured temporal representations and show that decoupling local temporal encoding from global attention-based modelling yields more effective and stable time-series forecasting.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12467v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DCAC: Dynamic Class-Aware Cache Creates Stronger Out-of-Distribution Detectors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12468</link><description>arXiv:2601.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks, particularly due to overconfident predictions on unseen OOD samples during testing. We reveal a key insight: OOD samples predicted as the same class, or given high probabilities for it, are visually more similar to each other than to the true in-distribution (ID) samples. Motivated by this class-specific observation, we propose DCAC (Dynamic Class-Aware Cache), a training-free, test-time calibration module that maintains separate caches for each ID class to collect high-entropy samples and calibrate the raw predictions of input samples. DCAC leverages cached visual features and predicted probabilities through a lightweight two-layer module to mitigate overconfident predictions on OOD samples. This module can be seamlessly integrated with various existing OOD detection methods across both unimodal and vision-language models while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple OOD benchmarks demonstrate that DCAC significantly enhances existing methods, achieving substantial improvements, i.e., reducing FPR95 by 6.55% when integrated with ASH-S on ImageNet OOD benchmark.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12468v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Knowing When to Abstain: Medical LLMs Under Clinical Uncertainty</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12471</link><description>arXiv:2601.12471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluation of large language models (LLMs) overwhelmingly prioritizes accuracy; however, in real-world and safety-critical applications, the ability to abstain when uncertain is equally vital for trustworthy deployment. We introduce MedAbstain, a unified benchmark and evaluation protocol for abstention in medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) -- a discrete-choice setting that generalizes to agentic action selection -- integrating conformal prediction, adversarial question perturbations, and explicit abstention options. Our systematic evaluation of both open- and closed-source LLMs reveals that even state-of-the-art, high-accuracy models often fail to abstain with uncertain. Notably, providing explicit abstention options consistently increases model uncertainty and safer abstention, far more than input perturbations, while scaling model size or advanced prompting brings little improvement. These findings highlight the central role of abstention mechanisms for trustworthy LLM deployment and offer practical guidance for improving safety in high-stakes applications.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12471v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Capability-Aware Early-Stage Research Idea Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12473</link><description>arXiv:2601.12473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of research ideas at their conceptual stage (i.e. before significant resources are committed) holds great potential for optimizing scientific resource allocation and research planning. While existing methods rely heavily on finished manuscripts or peer reviews, we propose a novel capability-aware framework that predicts paper acceptance and ratings using only author information and research ideas, without requiring full text or experimental results. Our approach integrates author information, (inferred) capability presentation, and research ideas through a three-way transformer architecture with flexible fusion mechanisms. We also introduce a two-stage architecture for learning the capability representation given the author information and idea. Experiments show that our method significantly outperform the single-way models by finetuning bert-base and bert-large, and the capability predicting significantly increase the predictive accuracy of the final model. The proposed method can be applied in both early-stage research outcome prediction and scientific resource allocation.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12473v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Language-Based Swarm Perception: Decentralized Person Re-Identification via Natural Language Descriptions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12479</link><description>arXiv:2601.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for decentralized person re-identification in robot swarms that leverages natural language as the primary representational modality. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on opaque visual embeddings -- high-dimensional feature vectors extracted from images -- the proposed method uses human-readable language to represent observations. Each robot locally detects and describes individuals using a vision-language model (VLM), producing textual descriptions of appearance instead of feature vectors. These descriptions are compared and clustered across the swarm without centralized coordination, allowing robots to collaboratively group observations of the same individual. Each cluster is distilled into a representative description by a language model, providing an interpretable, concise summary of the swarm's collective perception. This approach enables natural-language querying, enhances transparency, and supports explainable swarm behavior. Preliminary experiments demonstrate competitive performance in identity consistency and interpretability compared to embedding-based methods, despite current limitations in text similarity and computational load. Ongoing work explores refined similarity metrics, semantic navigation, and the extension of language-based perception to environmental elements. This work prioritizes decentralized perception and communication, while active navigation remains an open direction for future study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12479v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] A Unified Neural Codec Language Model for Selective Editable Text to Speech Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12480</link><description>arXiv:2601.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural codec language models achieve impressive zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) by fully imitating the acoustic characteristics of a short speech prompt, including timbre, prosody, and paralinguistic information. However, such holistic imitation limits their ability to isolate and control individual attributes. In this paper, we present a unified codec language model SpeechEdit that extends zero-shot TTS with a selective control mechanism. By default, SpeechEdit reproduces the complete acoustic profile inferred from the speech prompt, but it selectively overrides only the attributes specified by explicit control instructions. To enable controllable modeling, SpeechEdit is trained on our newly constructed LibriEdit dataset, which provides delta (difference-aware) training pairs derived from LibriHeavy. Experimental results show that our approach maintains naturalness and robustness while offering flexible and localized control over desired attributes.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic animal fur geometry from images is a challenging task due to the fine-scale details, self-occlusion, and view-dependent appearance of fur. In contrast to human hairstyle reconstruction, there are also no datasets that can be leveraged to learn a fur prior for different animals. In this work, we present a first multi-view-based method for high-fidelity 3D fur modeling of animals using a strand-based representation, leveraging the general knowledge of a vision language model. Given multi-view RGB images, we first reconstruct a coarse surface geometry using traditional multi-view stereo techniques. We then use a vision language model (VLM) system to retrieve information about the realistic length structure of the fur for each part of the body. We use this knowledge to construct the animal's furless geometry and grow strands atop it. The fur reconstruction is supervised with both geometric and photometric losses computed from multi-view images. To mitigate orientation ambiguities stemming from the Gabor filters that are applied to the input images, we additionally utilize the VLM to guide the strands' growth direction and their relation to the gravity vector that we incorporate as a loss. With this new schema of using a VLM to guide 3D reconstruction from multi-view inputs, we show generalization across a variety of animals with different fur types.

Abstract: Shopping is a routine activity for sighted individuals, yet for people who are blind or have low vision (pBLV), locating and retrieving products in physical environments remains a challenge. This paper presents a multimodal wearable assistive system that integrates object detection with vision-language models to support independent product or item retrieval, with the goal of enhancing users'autonomy and sense of agency. The system operates through three phases: product search, which identifies target products using YOLO-World detection combined with embedding similarity and color histogram matching; product navigation, which provides spatialized sonification and VLM-generated verbal descriptions to guide users toward the target; and product correction, which verifies whether the user has reached the correct product and provides corrective feedback when necessary. Technical evaluation demonstrated promising performance across all modules, with product detection achieving near-perfect accuracy at close range and high accuracy when facing shelves within 1.5 m. VLM-based navigation achieved up to 94.4% accuracy, and correction accuracy exceeded 86% under optimal model configurations. These results demonstrate the system's potential to address the last-meter problem in assistive shopping. Future work will focus on user studies with pBLV participants and integration with multi-scale navigation ecosystems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12486v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] VASTU: Value-Aligned Social Toolkit for Online Content Curation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12491</link><description>arXiv:2601.12491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting what content communities value is a foundational challenge for social computing systems -- from feed curation and content ranking to moderation tools and personalized recommendation systems. Yet existing approaches remain fragmented across methodological paradigms, and it remains unclear which methods best capture community-specific notions of value. We introduce VASTU (Value-Aligned Social Toolkit for Online Content Curation), a benchmark and evaluation framework for systematically comparing approaches to detecting community-valued content. VASTU includes a dataset of 75,000 comments from 15 diverse Reddit communities, annotated with community approval labels and rich linguistic features. Using VASTU, we evaluate feature-based models, transformers, prompted and fine-tuned language models under global versus community-specific training regimes. We find that community-specific models consistently outperform global approaches, with fine-tuned transformers achieving the strongest performance (0.72 AUROC). Notably, fine-tuned SLMs (0.65 AUROC) substantially outperform prompted LLMs (0.60 AUROC) despite being 100 times smaller. Counterintuitively, chain-of-thought prompting provides no benefit, and reasoning models perform the worst (0.53 AUROC), suggesting this task requires learning community norms rather than test-time reasoning. By releasing VASTU, we provide a standardized benchmark to advance research on value-aligned sociotechnical systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12491v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Histopath-C: Towards Realistic Domain Shifts for Histopathology Vision-Language Adaptation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12493</link><description>arXiv:2601.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performances in various medical imaging domains such as histo\-pathology by leveraging pre-trained, contrastive models that exploit visual and textual information. However, histopathology images may exhibit severe domain shifts, such as staining, contamination, blurring, and noise, which may severely degrade the VLM's downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Histopath-C, a new benchmark with realistic synthetic corruptions designed to mimic real-world distribution shifts observed in digital histopathology. Our framework dynamically applies corruptions to any available dataset and evaluates Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) mechanisms on the fly. We then propose LATTE, a transductive, low-rank adaptation strategy that exploits multiple text templates, mitigating the sensitivity of histopathology VLMs to diverse text inputs. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods originally designed for natural images across a breadth of histopathology datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed design for robust adaptation in histopathology images.

Abstract: Audio large language models (LLMs) enable unified speech understanding and generation, yet their adaptation to linguistically complex, dialect-rich settings remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of multi-task instruction tuning for an Arabic-centric audio LLM, covering a hierarchy of generative tasks (ASR, speech summarization) and discriminative tasks (dialect and emotion identification). To support this study, we introduce AraMega-SSum, a novel dataset for Arabic speech summarization. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Omni (7B) and propose Task-Progressive Curriculum (TPC) along with Aligner-Based Diverse Sampling (ADS), a strategy that constructs information-dense batches by selecting task- and label-balanced examples. Our results reveal a critical efficiency, robustness trade-off: while ADS accelerates initial convergence and boosts paralinguistic F1-scores, its inherent gradient volatility can destabilize generative decoding under prolonged training. Furthermore, while the TPC stabilizes core acoustic mapping, it often induces negative transfer in downstream tasks. We demonstrate that a Hybrid TPC+ADS Strategy provides an optimal training ``recipe'', first establishing a robust representative foundation before employing diversity-aware refinement to capture fine-grained nuances. These findings offer practical guidance for the efficient adaptation of Omni-models in complex, low-resource multimodal environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12494v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Failure Modes in Multi-Hop QA: The Weakest Link Law and the Recognition Bottleneck</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12499</link><description>arXiv:2601.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite scaling to massive context windows, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with multi-hop reasoning due to inherent position bias, which causes them to overlook information at certain positions. Whether these failures stem from an inability to locate evidence (recognition failure) or integrate it (synthesis failure) is unclear. We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the "Weakest Link Law": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $&lt;3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that "thinking" models that utilize System-2 reasoning, effectively locate and integrate the required information, matching gold-only baselines even in noisy, long-context settings.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12499v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Video Individual Counting and Tracking from Moving Drones: A Benchmark and Methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12500</link><description>arXiv:2601.12500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting and tracking dense crowds in large-scale scenes is highly challenging, yet existing methods mainly rely on datasets captured by fixed cameras, which provide limited spatial coverage and are inadequate for large-scale dense crowd analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a flexible solution using moving drones to capture videos and perform video-level crowd counting and tracking of unique pedestrians across entire scenes. We introduce MovingDroneCrowd++, the largest video-level dataset for dense crowd counting and tracking captured by moving drones, covering diverse and complex conditions with varying flight altitudes, camera angles, and illumination. Existing methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance on this dataset. To this end, we propose GD3A (Global Density Map Decomposition via Descriptor Association), a density map-based video individual counting method that avoids explicit localization. GD3A establishes pixel-level correspondences between pedestrian descriptors across consecutive frames via optimal transport with an adaptive dustbin score, enabling the decomposition of global density maps into shared, inflow, and outflow components. Building on this framework, we further introduce DVTrack, which converts descriptor-level matching into instance-level associations through a descriptor voting mechanism for pedestrian tracking. Experimental results show that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches under dense crowds and complex motion, reducing counting error by 47.4 percent and improving tracking performance by 39.2 percent.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12500v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Semidefinite Programming for Quantum Channel Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12502</link><description>arXiv:2601.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of reconstructing a quantum channel from a sample of classical data is considered. When the total fidelity can be represented as a ratio of two quadratic forms (e.g., in the case of mapping a mixed state to a pure state, projective operators, unitary learning, and others), Semidefinite Programming (SDP) can be applied to solve the fidelity optimization problem with respect to the Choi matrix. A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data. Finally, we discuss a classical computational model based on quantum channel transformation, performed and calculated on a classical computer, possibly hardware-optimized.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12502v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] DoPE: Decoy Oriented Perturbation Encapsulation Human-Readable, AI-Hostile Documents for Academic Integrity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12505</link><description>arXiv:2601.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can directly consume exam documents, threatening conventional assessments and academic integrity. We present DoPE (Decoy-Oriented Perturbation Encapsulation), a document-layer defense framework that embeds semantic decoys into PDF/HTML assessments to exploit render-parse discrepancies in MLLM pipelines.

We formalize prevention and detection tasks, and introduce FewSoRT-Q, an LLM-guided pipeline that generates question-level semantic decoys and FewSoRT-D to encapsulate them into watermarked documents. We evaluate on Integrity-Bench, a novel benchmark of 1826 exams (PDF+HTML) derived from public QA datasets and OpenCourseWare. Against black-box MLLMs from OpenAI and Anthropic, DoPE yields strong empirical gains: a 91.4% detection rate at an 8.7% false-positive rate using an LLM-as-Judge verifier, and prevents successful completion or induces decoy-aligned failures in 96.3% of attempts.

Abstract: In remote sensing images, complex backgrounds, weak object signals, and small object scales make accurate detection particularly challenging, especially under low-quality imaging conditions. A common strategy is to integrate single-image super-resolution (SR) before detection; however, such serial pipelines often suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, feature redundancy, and a lack of effective interaction between SR and detection. To address these issues, we propose a Saliency-Driven multi-task Collaborative Network (SDCoNet) that couples SR and detection through implicit feature sharing while preserving task specificity. SDCoNet employs the swin transformer-based shared encoder, where hierarchical window-shifted self-attention supports cross-task feature collaboration and adaptively balances the trade-off between texture refinement and semantic representation. In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection. Experiments on public datasets, including NWPU VHR-10-Split, DOTAv1.5-Split, and HRSSD-Split, demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, significantly outperforms existing mainstream algorithms in small object detection on low-quality remote sensing images.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet repeated syndrome-measurement cycles dominate its spacetime and hardware cost. Although stabilizers commute and admit many valid execution orders, different schedules induce distinct error-propagation paths under realistic noise, leading to large variations in logical error rate. Outside of surface codes, effective syndrome-measurement scheduling remains largely unexplored. We present AlphaSyndrome, an automated synthesis framework for scheduling syndrome-measurement circuits in general commuting-stabilizer codes under minimal assumptions: mutually commuting stabilizers and a heuristic decoder. AlphaSyndrome formulates scheduling as an optimization problem that shapes error propagation to (i) avoid patterns close to logical operators and (ii) remain within the decoder's correctable region. The framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore ordering and parallelism, guided by code structure and decoder feedback. Across diverse code families, sizes, and decoders, AlphaSyndrome reduces logical error rates by 80.6% on average (up to 96.2%) relative to depth-optimal baselines, matches Google's hand-crafted surface-code schedules, and outperforms IBM's schedule for the Bivariate Bicycle code.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12509v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Fine-Tuning Cycle-GAN for Domain Adaptation of MRI Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12512</link><description>arXiv:2601.12512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans acquired from different scanners or institutions often suffer from domain shifts owing to variations in hardware, protocols, and acquisition parameters. This discrepancy degrades the performance of deep learning models trained on source domain data when applied to target domain images. In this study, we propose a Cycle-GAN-based model for unsupervised medical-image domain adaptation. Leveraging CycleGANs, our model learns bidirectional mappings between the source and target domains without paired training data, preserving the anatomical content of the images. By leveraging Cycle-GAN capabilities with content and disparity loss for adaptation tasks, we ensured image-domain adaptation while maintaining image integrity. Several experiments on MRI datasets demonstrated the efficacy of our model in bidirectional domain adaptation without labelled data. Furthermore, research offers promising avenues for improving the diagnostic accuracy of healthcare. The statistical results confirm that our approach improves model performance and reduces domain-related variability, thus contributing to more precise and consistent medical image analysis.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12512v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Cooperative Multi-agent RL with Communication Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12518</link><description>arXiv:2601.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative MARL often assumes frequent access to global information in a data buffer, such as team rewards or other agents' actions, which is typically unrealistic in decentralized MARL systems due to high communication costs. When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\max_i |A_i|)\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum. Empirically, we test the base policy prediction algorithm in both simulated games and MAPPO for complex environments.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12518v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Learning Relativistic Geodesics and Chaotic Dynamics via Stabilized Lagrangian Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12519</link><description>arXiv:2601.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) can learn arbitrary Lagrangians from trajectory data, but their unusual optimization objective leads to significant training instabilities that limit their application to complex systems. We propose several improvements that address these fundamental challenges, namely, a Hessian regularization scheme that penalizes unphysical signatures in the Lagrangian's second derivatives with respect to velocities, preventing the network from learning unstable dynamics, activation functions that are better suited to the problem of learning Lagrangians, and a physics-aware coordinate scaling that improves stability. We systematically evaluate these techniques alongside previously proposed methods for improving stability. Our improved architecture successfully trains on systems of unprecedented complexity, including triple pendulums, and achieved 96.6\% lower validation loss value and 90.68\% better stability than baseline LNNs in double pendulum systems. With the improved framework, we show that our LNNs can learn Lagrangians representing geodesic motion in both non-relativistic and general relativistic settings. To deal with the relativistic setting, we extended our regularization to penalize violations of Lorentzian signatures, which allowed us to predict a geodesic Lagrangian under AdS\textsubscript{4} spacetime metric directly from trajectory data, which to our knowledge has not been done in the literature before. This opens new possibilities for automated discovery of geometric structures in physics, including extraction of spacetime metric tensor components from geodesic trajectories. While our approach inherits some limitations of the original LNN framework, particularly the requirement for invertible Hessians, it significantly expands the practical applicability of LNNs for scientific discovery tasks.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12519v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improved Bug Localization with AI Agents Leveraging Hypothesis and Dynamic Cognition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12522</link><description>arXiv:2601.12522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software bugs cost technology providers (e.g., AT&amp;amp;T) billions annually and cause developers to spend roughly 50% of their time on bug resolution. Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12522v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Enabling High-Curvature Navigation in Eversion Robots through Buckle-Inducing Constrictive Bands</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12523</link><description>arXiv:2601.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tip-growing eversion robots are renowned for their ability to access remote spaces through narrow passages. However, achieving reliable navigation remains a significant challenge. Existing solutions often rely on artificial muscles integrated into the robot body or active tip-steering mechanisms. While effective, these additions introduce structural complexity and compromise the defining advantages of eversion robots: their inherent softness and compliance. In this paper, we propose a passive approach to reduce bending stiffness by purposefully introducing buckling points along the robot's outer wall. We achieve this by integrating inextensible diameter-reducing circumferential bands at regular intervals along the robot body facilitating forward motion through tortuous, obstacle cluttered paths. Rather than relying on active steering, our approach leverages the robot's natural interaction with the environment, allowing for smooth, compliant navigation. We present a Cosserat rod-based mathematical model to quantify this behavior, capturing the local stiffness reductions caused by the constricting bands and their impact on global bending mechanics. Experimental results demonstrate that these bands reduce the robot's stiffness when bent at the tip by up to 91 percent, enabling consistent traversal of 180 degree bends with a bending radius of as low as 25 mm-notably lower than the 35 mm achievable by standard eversion robots under identical conditions. The feasibility of the proposed method is further demonstrated through a case study in a colon phantom. By significantly improving maneuverability without sacrificing softness or increasing mechanical complexity, this approach expands the applicability of eversion robots in highly curved pathways, whether in relation to pipe inspection or medical procedures such as colonoscopy.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12523v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] SGCP: A Self-Organized Game-Theoretic Framework For Collaborative Perception</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12524</link><description>arXiv:2601.12524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception holds great promise for improving safety in autonomous driving, particularly in dense traffic where vehicles can share sensory information to overcome individual blind spots and extend awareness. However, deploying such collaboration at scale remains difficult when communication bandwidth is limited and no roadside infrastructure is available. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fully decentralized framework that enables vehicles to self organize into cooperative groups using only vehicle to vehicle communication. The approach decomposes the problem into two sequential game theoretic stages. In the first stage, vehicles form stable clusters by evaluating mutual sensing complementarity and motion coherence, and each cluster elects a coordinator. In the second stage, the coordinator guides its members to selectively transmit point cloud segments from perceptually salient regions through a non cooperative potential game, enabling efficient local fusion. Global scene understanding is then achieved by exchanging compact detection messages across clusters rather than raw sensor data. We design distributed algorithms for both stages that guarantee monotonic improvement of the system wide potential function. Comprehensive experiments on the CARLA-OpenCDA-NS3 co-simulation platform show that our method reduces communication overhead while delivering higher perception accuracy and wider effective coverage compared to existing baselines.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12524v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Deep Feature Deformation Weights</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12527</link><description>arXiv:2601.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handle-based mesh deformation has been a long-standing paradigm in computer graphics, enabling intuitive shape edits from sparse controls. Classic techniques offer precise and rapid deformation control. However, they solve an optimization problem with constraints defined by control handle placement, requiring a user to know apriori the ideal distribution of handles on the shape to accomplish the desired edit. The mapping from handle set to deformation behavior is often unintuitive and, importantly, non-semantic. Modern data-driven methods, on the other hand, leverage a data prior to obtain semantic edits, but are slow and imprecise. We propose a technique that fuses the semantic prior of data with the precise control and speed of traditional frameworks. Our approach is surprisingly simple yet effective: deep feature proximity makes for smooth and semantic deformation weights, with no need for additional regularization. The weights can be computed in real-time for any surface point, whereas prior methods require optimization for new handles. Moreover, the semantic prior from deep features enables co-deformation of semantic parts. We introduce an improved feature distillation pipeline, barycentric feature distillation, which efficiently uses the visual signal from shape renders to minimize distillation cost. This allows our weights to be computed for high resolution meshes in under a minute, in contrast to potentially hours for both classical and neural methods. We preserve and extend properties of classical methods through feature space constraints and locality weighting. Our field representation allows for automatic detection of semantic symmetries, which we use to produce symmetry-preserving deformations. We show a proof-of-concept application which can produce deformations for meshes up to 1 million faces in real-time on a consumer-grade machine.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How to Get Close to the Median Shape</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12529</link><description>arXiv:2601.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\renewcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}}\newcommand{\eps}{{\varepsilon}}\newcommand{\poly}{\mathrm{poly}} $In this paper, we study the problem of $L_1$-fitting a shape to a set of $n$ points in $\Re^d$ (where $d$ is a fixed constant), where the target is to minimize the sum of distances of the points to the shape, or the sum of squared distances. We present a general technique for computing a $(1 + \eps ) $-approximation for such a problem, with running time $O(n + \poly( \log n, 1/\eps))$, where $\poly(\log n, 1/\eps)$ is a polynomial of constant degree of $\log n$ and $1/\eps$ (the power of the polynomial is a function of $d$). The new algorithm runs in linear time for a fixed $\eps&gt;0$, and is the first subquadratic algorithm for this problem.
  Applications of the algorithm include best fitting either a circle, a sphere, or a cylinder to a set of points when minimizing the sum of distances (or squared distances) to the respective shape.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12529v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] XRefine: Attention-Guided Keypoint Match Refinement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12530</link><description>arXiv:2601.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse keypoint matching is crucial for 3D vision tasks, yet current keypoint detectors often produce spatially inaccurate matches. Existing refinement methods mitigate this issue through alignment of matched keypoint locations, but they are typically detector-specific, requiring retraining for each keypoint detector. We introduce XRefine, a novel, detector-agnostic approach for sub-pixel keypoint refinement that operates solely on image patches centered at matched keypoints. Our cross-attention-based architecture learns to predict refined keypoint coordinates without relying on internal detector representations, enabling generalization across detectors. Furthermore, XRefine can be extended to handle multi-view feature tracks. Experiments on MegaDepth, KITTI, and ScanNet demonstrate that the approach consistently improves geometric estimation accuracy, achieving superior performance compared to existing refinement methods while maintaining runtime efficiency. Our code and trained models can be found at https://github.com/boschresearch/xrefine.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12530v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Encoding Emotion Through Self-Supervised Eye Movement Reconstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12534</link><description>arXiv:2601.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between emotional expression and eye movement is well-documented, with literature establishing gaze patterns are reliable indicators of emotion. However, most studies utilize specialized, high-resolution eye-tracking equipment, limiting the potential reach of findings. We investigate how eye movement can be used to predict multimodal markers of emotional expression from naturalistic, low-resolution videos. We utilize a collection of video interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive with Holocaust survivors as they recount their experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Inspired by pretraining methods on language models, we develop a novel gaze detection model that uses self-supervised eye movement reconstruction that can effectively leverage unlabeled video. We use this model's encoder embeddings to fine-tune models on two downstream tasks related to emotional expression. The first is aligning eye movement with directional emotion estimates from speech. The second task is using eye gaze as a predictor of three momentary manifestations of emotional behaviors: laughing, crying/sobbing, and sighing. We find our new model is predictive of emotion outcomes and observe a positive correlation between pretraining performance and emotion processing performance for both experiments. We conclude self-supervised eye movement reconstruction is an effective method for encoding the affective signal they carry.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12534v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Improving Low-Resource Machine Translation via Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12535</link><description>arXiv:2601.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) has gained increasing attention as parallel data from low-resource language communities is collected, but many potential methods for improving low-resource MT remain unexplored. We investigate a self-supervised reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning for translation in low-resource settings using round-trip bootstrapping with the No Language Left Behind (NLLB) family of models. Our approach translates English into a target low-resource language and then back into English, using a combination of chrF++ and BLEU as the reward function on the reconstructed English sentences. Using the NLLB-MD dataset, we evaluate both the 600M and 1.3B parameter NLLB models and observe consistent improvements for the following languages: Central Aymara, Friulian, Wolof and Russian. Qualitative inspection of translation outputs indicates increased fluency and semantic fidelity. We argue that our method can further benefit from scale, enabling models to increasingly leverage their pretrained knowledge and continue self-improving.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Reasoning for Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12538</link><description>arXiv:2601.12538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process underlying inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12538v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] MemeLens: Multilingual Multitask VLMs for Memes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12539</link><description>arXiv:2601.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memes are a dominant medium for online communication and manipulation because meaning emerges from interactions between embedded text, imagery, and cultural context. Existing meme research is distributed across tasks (hate, misogyny, propaganda, sentiment, humour) and languages, which limits cross-domain generalization. To address this gap we propose MemeLens, a unified multilingual and multitask explanation-enhanced Vision Language Model (VLM) for meme understanding. We consolidate 38 public meme datasets, filter and map dataset-specific labels into a shared taxonomy of $20$ tasks spanning harm, targets, figurative/pragmatic intent, and affect. We present a comprehensive empirical analysis across modeling paradigms, task categories, and datasets. Our findings suggest that robust meme understanding requires multimodal training, exhibits substantial variation across semantic categories, and remains sensitive to over-specialization when models are fine-tuned on individual datasets rather than trained in a unified setting. We will make the experimental resources and datasets publicly available for the community.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12539v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Rethinking the AI Scientist: Interactive Multi-Agent Workflows for Scientific Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12542</link><description>arXiv:2601.12542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems for scientific discovery have demonstrated remarkable potential, yet existing approaches remain largely proprietary and operate in batch-processing modes requiring hours per research cycle, precluding real-time researcher guidance. This paper introduces Deep Research, a multi-agent system enabling interactive scientific investigation with turnaround times measured in minutes. The architecture comprises specialized agents for planning, data analysis, literature search, and novelty detection, unified through a persistent world state that maintains context across iterative research cycles. Two operational modes support different workflows: semi-autonomous mode with selective human checkpoints, and fully autonomous mode for extended investigations. Evaluation on the BixBench computational biology benchmark demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving 48.8% accuracy on open response and 64.5% on multiple-choice evaluation, exceeding existing baselines by 14 to 26 percentage points.

Abstract: We study the online centralized charging scheduling problem (OCCSP). In this problem, a central authority must decide, in real time, when to charge dynamically arriving electric vehicles (EVs), subject to capacity limits, with the objective of balancing load across a finite planning horizon. To solve the problem, we first gamify it; that is, we model it as a game where charging blocks are placed within temporal and capacity constraints on a grid. We design heuristic policies, train learning agents with expert demonstrations, and improve them using Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). From a theoretical standpoint, we show that gamification reduces model complexity and yields tighter generalization bounds than vector-based formulations. Experiments across multiple EV arrival patterns confirm that gamified learning enhances load balancing. In particular, the image-to-movement model trained with DAgger consistently outperforms heuristic baselines, vector-based approaches, and supervised learning agents, while also demonstrating robustness in sensitivity analyses. These operational gains translate into tangible economic value. In a real-world case study for the Greater Montr\'eal Area (Qu\'ebec, Canada) using utility cost data, the proposed methods lower system costs by tens of millions of dollars per year over the prevailing practice and show clear potential to delay costly grid upgrades.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12543v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Information Farming: From Berry Picking to Berry Growing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12544</link><description>arXiv:2601.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic paradigms of Berry Picking and Information Foraging Theory have framed users as gatherers, opportunistically searching across distributed sources to satisfy evolving information needs. However, the rise of GenAI is driving a fundamental transformation in how people produce, structure, and reuse information - one that these paradigms no longer fully capture. This transformation is analogous to the Neolithic Revolution, when societies shifted from hunting and gathering to cultivation. Generative technologies empower users to "farm" information by planting seeds in the form of prompts, cultivating workflows over time, and harvesting richly structured, relevant yields within their own plots, rather than foraging across others people's patches. In this perspectives paper, we introduce the notion of Information Farming as a conceptual framework and argue that it represents a natural evolution in how people engage with information. Drawing on historical analogy and empirical evidence, we examine the benefits and opportunities of information farming, its implications for design and evaluation, and the accompanying risks posed by this transition. We hypothesize that as GenAI technologies proliferate, cultivating information will increasingly supplant transient, patch-based foraging as a dominant mode of engagement, marking a broader shift in human-information interaction and its study.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] How Clinicians Think and What AI Can Learn From It</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12547</link><description>arXiv:2601.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most clinical AI systems operate as prediction engines -- producing labels or risk scores -- yet real clinical reasoning is a time-bounded, sequential control problem under uncertainty. Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\to$ perception $\to$ inference $\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($\epsilon$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12547v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Traffic Collisions: Temporal Patterns and Severity-Weighted Hotspot Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12548</link><description>arXiv:2601.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding traffic collision patterns is of high importance for effective road safety planning in fast-growing urban environments. This study examines the temporal and spatial patterns of traffic collisions in Dubai, UAE, with a particular focus on collision severity. To this end, traffic collision records from November 2024 to June 2025 were analyzed to examine hourly, daily, and monthly variations in collision frequency and severity for both overall traffic collisions and pedestrian-related accidents. Temporal associations with severity were evaluated using chi-square tests and Cramer's V, while spatial patterns were analyzed using severity-weighted hotspot analysis based on the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, complemented by inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation. The results show a clear temporal variation in overall collision frequency and severity, with higher collision frequencies during evening and nighttime periods with 44% higher probability of high-severity outcomes at night compared to the afternoon. On the other hand, pedestrian-related accidents showed a distinct temporal profile, characterized by higher occurrence during late-evening hours and relatively limited variation across days of the week and months. Spatial analysis identified statistically significant severity hotspots for overall collisions in the northern and northwestern parts of Dubai and along the Al Ain-Dubai Highway, while pedestrian severity hotspots were concentrated near industrial areas in the southwestern region. Several policy measures are proposed based on the findings including, reducing nighttime speed limits, enhancing automated enforcement, improving roadway lighting, and implementing pedestrian-focused treatments in statistically significant hotspots.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12548v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Concept-Spilling Across Languages in LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12549</link><description>arXiv:2601.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable cross-lingual abilities, yet often exhibit a systematic bias toward the representations from other languages, resulting in semantic interference when generating content in non-English languages$-$a phenomenon we define as language spilling. This paper presents a novel comparative framework for evaluating multilingual semantic robustness by systematically measuring how models handle polysemous words across languages. Our methodology provides a relative measure of model performance: when required to generate exactly five meanings, both strong and weak models may resort to meanings from dominant languages, but semantically stronger models do so later in the generation sequence, producing more true meanings from the target language before failing, while weaker models resort to dominant-language meanings earlier in the sequence. We evaluate a diverse set of open and closed multilingual LLMs using a structured meaning generation task across nine languages, employing a carefully curated benchmark of 100 high-polysemy English words. Our findings reveal significant variation in semantic robustness across both models and languages, providing a principled ranking system for model comparison without requiring definitive causal attribution of error sources. We contribute both a scalable comparative benchmark for multilingual semantic evaluation and a rigorous validation pipeline$-$critical tools for developing more linguistically balanced AI systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12549v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] PISE: Physics-Anchored Semantically-Enhanced Deep Computational Ghost Imaging for Robust Low-Bandwidth Machine Perception</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12551</link><description>arXiv:2601.12551v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can recall a wide range of factual knowledge across languages. However, existing factual recall evaluations primarily assess fact retrieval in isolation, where the queried entity is explicitly named and the fact is requested directly. In natural language use, facts are often accessed through context, where the relevant entity is introduced only indirectly. In this work, we study contextually mediated factual recall, asking whether LLMs can reliably retrieve factual knowledge when the target entity is embedded in a naturalistic context rather than queried explicitly, across languages. We construct controlled prompts that preserve the underlying fact while introducing referential mediation through contextual sentences. To disentangle contextual effects from name-specific associations, we further compare performance using synthetic names and real names across languages. Evaluating multiple model families in five languages, we find that contextual mediation consistently degrades factual recall, with substantial variation across relations. Larger models are more robust to contextual mediation, exhibiting a reduced performance gap relative to direct queries, while the effect of real names and name origin is mixed and unsystematic. These findings highlight a gap between isolated factual recall and context-dependent language understanding in multilingual LLMs.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12555v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Life, Machine Learning, and the Search for Habitability: Predicting Biosignature Fluxes for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12557</link><description>arXiv:2601.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future direct-imaging flagship missions, such as NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), face critical decisions in prioritizing observations due to extremely stringent time and resource constraints. In this paper, we introduce two advanced machine-learning architectures tailored for predicting biosignature species fluxes from exoplanetary reflected-light spectra: a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) and our novel model architecture, the Spectral Query Adaptive Transformer (SQuAT). The BCNN robustly quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, offering reliable predictions under diverse observational conditions, whereas SQuAT employs query-driven attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability by explicitly associating spectral features with specific biosignature species. We demonstrate that both models achieve comparably high predictive accuracy on an augmented dataset spanning a wide range of exoplanetary conditions, while highlighting their distinct advantages in uncertainty quantification and spectral interpretability. These capabilities position our methods as promising tools for accelerating target triage, optimizing observation schedules, and maximizing scientific return for upcoming flagship missions such as HWO.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12557v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Automated Tool Support for Category-Partition Testing: Design Decisions, UI and Examples of Use</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12559</link><description>arXiv:2601.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Category-Partition is a functional testing technique that is based on the idea that the input domain of the system under test can be divided into sub-domains, with the assumption that inputs that belong to the same sub-domain trigger a similar behaviour and that therefore it is sufficient to select one input from each sub-domain. Category-Partition proceeds in several steps, from the identification of so-called categories and choices, possibly constrained, which are subsequently used to form test frames, i.e., combinations of choices, and eventually test cases. This paper reports on an ongoing attempt to automate as many of those steps as possible, with graphical-user interface tool support. Specifically, the user interface allows the user to specify parameters as well as so-called environment variables, further specify categories and choices with optional constraints. Choices are provided with precise specifications with operations specific to their types (e.g., Boolean, Integer, Real, String). Then, the tool automates the construction of test frames, which are combinations of choices, according to alternative selection criteria, and the identification of input values for parameters and environment variables for these test frames, thereby producing test cases. The paper illustrates the capabilities of the tool with the use of nine different case studies.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12559v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI): Architectures, Taxonomies, and Evaluation of Large Language Model Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12560</link><description>arXiv:2601.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is moving from models that only generate text to Agentic AI, where systems behave as autonomous entities that can perceive, reason, plan, and act. Large Language Models (LLMs) are no longer used only as passive knowledge engines but as cognitive controllers that combine memory, tool use, and feedback from their environment to pursue extended goals. This shift already supports the automation of complex workflows in software engineering, scientific discovery, and web navigation, yet the variety of emerging designs, from simple single loop agents to hierarchical multi agent systems, makes the landscape hard to navigate. In this paper, we investigate architectures and propose a unified taxonomy that breaks agents into Perception, Brain, Planning, Action, Tool Use, and Collaboration. We use this lens to describe the move from linear reasoning procedures to native inference time reasoning models, and the transition from fixed API calls to open standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Native Computer Use. We also group the environments in which these agents operate, including digital operating systems, embodied robotics, and other specialized domains, and we review current evaluation practices. Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as hallucination in action, infinite loops, and prompt injection, and outline future research directions toward more robust and reliable autonomous systems.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12560v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] Camera Pose Revisited</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12567</link><description>arXiv:2601.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the position and orientation of a camera with respect to an observed scene is one of the central problems in computer vision, particularly in the context of camera calibration and multi-sensor systems. This paper addresses the planar Perspective--$n$--Point problem, with special emphasis on the initial estimation of the pose of a calibration object. As a solution, we propose the \texttt{PnP-ProCay78} algorithm, which combines the classical quadratic formulation of the reconstruction error with a Cayley parameterization of rotations and least-squares optimization. The key component of the method is a deterministic selection of starting points based on an analysis of the reconstruction error for two canonical vectors, allowing costly solution-space search procedures to be avoided. Experimental validation is performed using data acquired also from high-resolution RGB cameras and very low-resolution thermal cameras in an integrated RGB--IR setup. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves practically the same projection accuracy as optimal \texttt{SQPnP} and slightly higher than \texttt{IPPE}, both prominent \texttt{PnP-OpenCV} procedures. However, \texttt{PnP-ProCay78} maintains a significantly simpler algorithmic structure. Moreover, the analysis of optimization trajectories in Cayley space provides an intuitive insight into the convergence process, making the method attractive also from a didactic perspective. Unlike existing PnP solvers, the proposed \texttt{PnP-ProCay78} algorithm combines projection error minimization with an analytically eliminated reconstruction-error surrogate for translation, yielding a hybrid cost formulation that is both geometrically transparent and computationally efficient.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12567v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs updates on arXiv.org] The Origin of the Inaccessible Game</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12576</link><description>arXiv:2601.12576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inaccessible game is an information-geometric framework where dynamics of information loss emerge from maximum entropy production under marginal-entropy conservation.
  We study the game's starting state, the origin. Classical Shannon entropy forbids a representation with zero joint entropy and positive marginal entropies: non-negativity of conditional entropy rules this out. Replacing Shannon with von Neumann entropy within the Baez Fritz Leinster Parzygnat categorical framework removes this obstruction and admits a well-defined origin: a globally pure state with maximally mixed marginals, selected up to local-unitary equivalence. At this LME origin, marginal-entropy conservation becomes a second-order geometric condition. Because the marginal-entropy sum is saturated termwise, the constraint gradient vanishes and first-order tangency is vacuous; admissible directions are selected by the kernel of the constraint Hessian, characterised by the marginal-preserving tangent space.
  We derive the constrained gradient flow in the matrix exponential family and show that, as the origin is approached, the affine time parameter degenerates. This motivates an axiomatically distinguished reparametrisation, entropy time $t$, defined by $dH/dt = c$ for fixed constant $c&gt;0$. In this parametrisation, the infinite affine-time approach to the boundary maps to a finite entropy-time interval. The constrained dynamics split into a symmetric dissipative component realising SEA and a reversible component represented as unitary evolution.
  As in the classical game, marginal-entropy conservation is equivalent to conservation of a sum of local modular Hamiltonian expectations, a state-dependent "modular energy"; in Gibbs regimes where local modular generators become approximately parameter-invariant, this reduces to familiar fixed-energy constraints from nonequilibrium thermodynamics.</description><author>cs updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12576v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
